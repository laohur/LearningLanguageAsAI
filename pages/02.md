<font size=3>
A battle is an occurrence of combat in warfare between opposing military units of any number or size. 　A war usually consists of multiple battles. 　In general, a battle is a military engagement that is well defined in duration, area, and force commitment. 　An engagement with only limited commitment between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish. 　The word "battle" can also be used infrequently to refer to an entire operational campaign, although this usage greatly diverges from its conventional or customary meaning. 　Generally, the word "battle" is used for such campaigns if referring to a protracted combat encounter in which either one or both of the combatants had the same methods, resources, and strategic objectives throughout the encounter. 　Some prominent examples of this would be the Battle of the Atlantic, Battle of Britain, and Battle of Stalingrad, all in World War II. 　Wars and military campaigns are guided by military strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility. 　German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that "the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war" was the essence of strategy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition>Addition</a> 

<font size=3>
Addition (usually signified by the plus symbol +) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the other three being subtraction, multiplication and division. 　The addition of two whole numbers results in the total amount or sum of those values combined. 　The example in the adjacent image shows a combination of three apples and two apples, making a total of five apples. 　This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression "3 + 2 = 5" (that is, "3 plus 2 is equal to 5"). 　Besides counting items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to concrete objects, using abstractions called numbers instead, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. 　Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of mathematics. 　In algebra, another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects such as vectors, matrices, subspaces and subgroups. 　Addition has several important properties. 　It is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see Summation). 　Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting (see Successor function). 　Addition of 0 does not change a number. 　Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication. 　Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks to do. 　Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months, and even some members of other animal species. 　In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. 　Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.

<font size=3>
India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. 　It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. 　Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. 　In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. 　Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. 　Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. 　Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. 　By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. 　Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. 　Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. 　The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. 　By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. 　Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. 　Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. 　In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia. 　In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. 　Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. 　In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. 　In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. 　The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. 　Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty. 　British Crown rule began in 1858. 　The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. 　A pioneering and influential nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and it became the major factor in ending British rule. 　In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration. 　India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. 　It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. 　India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022. 　During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. 　From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. 　It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. 　Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. 　India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. 　India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. 　It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. 　Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. 　India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. 　Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. 　India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia>Australia</a> 

<font size=3>
Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. 　With an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi), Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. 　Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. 　It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east. 　The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south east Asia approximately 65,000 years ago, during the last ice age. 　Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world. 　Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. 　The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. 　In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. 　The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies established. 　Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. 　Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and wealthy market economy. 　Politically, Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. 　Australia's population of nearly 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. 　Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous city and financial centre is Sydney. 　The next four largest cities are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. 　Australia's demography has been shaped by centuries of immigration: immigrants account for 30% of the country's population, and almost half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas. 　Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education. 　Australia is a highly developed country with a high-income economy. 　As of 2022, it was the world's fourteenth-largest economy with the ninth-highest per capita income. 　In 2021, it ranked as fifth-highest Human Development Index. 　Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure. 　Australia ranks amongst the highest in the world for quality of life, democracy, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties, safety, and political rights, with all its major cities faring exceptionally in global comparative livability surveys. 　It is a member of international groupings including the United Nations, the G20, the OECD, the World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community the Commonwealth of Nations, and the defence/security organisations ANZUS, AUKUS, the Five Eyes and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter>Matter</a> 

<font size=3>
In classical physics and general chemistry, matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume. 　All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of atoms, which are made up of interacting subatomic particles, and in everyday as well as scientific usage, "matter" generally includes atoms and anything made up of them, and any particles (or combination of particles) that act as if they have both rest mass and volume. 　However it does not include massless particles such as photons, or other energy phenomena or waves such as light or heat.　: 21  Matter exists in various states (also known as phases). 　These include classical everyday phases such as solid, liquid, and gas – for example water exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – but other states are possible, including plasma, Bose–Einstein condensates, fermionic condensates, and quark–gluon plasma. 　Usually atoms can be imagined as a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a surrounding "cloud" of orbiting electrons which "take up space". 　However this is only somewhat correct, because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their quantum nature, which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like waves as well as particles and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. 　In the Standard Model of particle physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because the elementary constituents of atoms are quantum entities which do not have an inherent "size" or "volume" in any everyday sense of the word. 　Due to the exclusion principle and other fundamental interactions, some "point particles" known as fermions (quarks, leptons), and many composites and atoms, are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space. 　For much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. 　The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, appeared in both ancient Greece and ancient India. 　Early philosophers who proposed the particulate theory of matter include Kanada (c. 6th–century BCE or after), Leucippus (~490 BCE), and Democritus (~470–380 BCE).

<font size=3>
Mass is an intrinsic property of a body. 　It was traditionally believed to be related to the quantity of matter in a physical body, until the discovery of the atom and particle physics. 　It was found that different atoms and different elementary particles, theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses. 　Mass in modern physics has multiple definitions which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent. 　Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body's inertia, meaning the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied. 　The object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies. 　The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). 　In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. 　An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass. 　This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.

Coordinates: 47°N 2°E﻿ / ﻿47°N 2°E﻿ / 47; 2 France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik frɑ̃sɛz]), is a country located primarily in Western Europe. 　It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. 　Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. 　Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and had a total population of over 68 million as of January 2023[update]. 　France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, and Nice. 　Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. 　Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. 　The Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. 　The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. 　In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralised feudal kingdom. 　Philip II successfully strengthened royal power and defeated his rivals to double the size of the crown lands; by the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe. 　From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result. 　The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second-largest in the world. 　The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country. 　France again emerged as Europe's dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War. 　Inadequate economic policies, inequitable taxes and frequent wars (notably a defeat in the Seven Years' War and costly involvement in the American War of Independence) left the kingdom in a precarious economic situation by the end of the 18th century. 　This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. 　France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. 　The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. 　The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. 　Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, as well as economic prosperity, known as the Belle Époque. 　France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at a great human and economic cost. 　It was among the Allied powers of World War II but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940. 　Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. 　The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. 　Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France. 　France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. 　It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018. 　France is a developed country ranked 28th in the Human Development Index, with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. 　France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, and life expectancy. 　It remains a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. 　France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California>California</a> 

<font size=3>
California is a state in the Western United States, located along the Pacific Coast. 　With nearly 39.2 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous U.S. state and the third-largest by area. 　It is also the most populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most populous in the world. 　The Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas are the nation's second and fifth most populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the latter having over 9.6 million. 　Sacramento is the state's capital, while Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the second most populous city in the country. 　San Francisco is the second most densely populated major city in the country. 　Los Angeles County is the country's most populous, while San Bernardino County is the largest county by area in the country. 　California borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, the Mexican state of Baja California to the south; and has a coastline along the Pacific Ocean to the west. 　The economy of the state of California is the largest in the United States, with a $3.4 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2022[update]. 　It is the largest sub-national economy in the world. 　If California were a sovereign nation, it would rank as the world's fifth-largest economy as of 2022[update], behind Germany and ahead of India, as well as the 37th most populous. 　The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and third-largest urban economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.5 trillion respectively as of 2020[update]). 　The San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation's highest gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas in 2018, and is home to five of the world's ten largest companies by market capitalization and four of the world's ten richest people. 　Slightly over 84 percent of the state's residents hold a high school degree, the lowest high school education rate of all 50 states. 　Prior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America and contained the highest Native American population density north of what is now Mexico. 　European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization of California by the Spanish Empire. 　In 1804, it was included in Alta California province within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. 　The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. 　The California Gold Rush started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, including large-scale immigration into California, a worldwide economic boom, and the California genocide of indigenous peoples. 　The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, following the Compromise of 1850. 　Notable contributions to popular culture, for example in entertainment, sports, music, and fashion, have their origins in California. 　The state also has made noteworthy contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, education, environmentalism, economics, politics, technology, and religion. 　It is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, which has had a profound influence upon global entertainment. 　It is considered the origin of the American film industry, hippie counterculture, beach and car culture, the personal computer, the internet, fast food, diners, burger joints, skateboarding, and the fortune cookie among other innovations. 　The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as the centers of the global technology and film industries, respectively. 　California's economy is very diverse: 58% of it is based on finance, government, real estate, technology, professional, scientific, technical and business services, education, health, transportation, trade, hospitality, leisure, utilities, tourism, manufacturing, construction, shipping, and many other industries. 　Although agriculture accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state. 　California's ports and harbors handle about a third of all U.S. imports, most originating in Pacific Rim international trade. 　The state's extremely diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. 　The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. 　California is well known for its warm Mediterranean climate and monsoon seasonal weather. 　The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains. 　Drought and wildfires are a persistent issue for the state. 　California has established a state program in recognition of Native American use of fire in ecosystems to mitigate wildfires.

<font size=3>
Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, and comes from Latin constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction. 　To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure. 　In its most widely used context, construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, infrastructure, industrial facilities and associated activities through to the end of their life. 　It typically starts with planning, financing, and design, and continues until the asset is built and ready for use; construction also covers repairs and maintenance work, any works to expand, extend and improve the asset, and its eventual demolition, dismantling or decommissioning. 　The construction industry contributes significantly to many countries’ gross domestic products (GDP). 　Global expenditure on construction activities was about $4 trillion in 2012. 　In 2022, expenditure on the construction industry exceeded $11 trillion a year, equivalent to about 13 percent of global GDP. 　This spending was forecast to rise to around $14.8 trillion in 2030. 　Although the construction industry promotes economic development and brings many non-monetary benefits to many countries, it is one of the most hazardous industries. 　For example, about 20% (1,061) of US industry fatalities in 2019 happened in construction.

<font size=3>
Sea refers to a large body of salty water, specifically of seawater. 　There are particular seas and the sea. 　The body of saline water that is generally referred to as the sea, is a body of salt water that extends as ocean water and ocean (or world ocean) over approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. 　The particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes (e.g. the Caspian Sea). 　The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. 　The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride. 　The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. 　The ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles. 　The surface of water interacts with the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature, as well as currents. 　Surface currents are the water currents that are produced by the atmosphere's currents and its winds blowing over the surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow but stable circulations of water, as in the case of the ocean sustaining deep-sea ocean currents. 　Deep-sea currents, known together as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and significantly influencing Earth's climate. 　Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. 　Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. 　Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites. 　A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals, lives in the seas, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in tropical regions. 　Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there. 　The seas have been an integral element for humans throughout history and culture. 　Humans harnessing and studying the seas have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography and maritime space is governed by the law of the sea, with admiralty law regulating human interactions at sea. 　The seas provide substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater. 　Other human uses of the seas include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving. 　Many of these activities create marine pollution.

<font size=3>
Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis. 　Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. 　The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. 　Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types, and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin. 　Attitudes towards different forms of hair, such as hairstyles and hair removal, vary widely across different cultures and historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person's personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, sex, or religion.

A word is a basic element of language that carries an objective or practical meaning, can be used on its own, and is uninterruptible. 　Despite the fact that language speakers often have an intuitive grasp of what a word is, there is no consensus among linguists on its definition and numerous attempts to find specific criteria of the concept remain controversial. 　Different standards have been proposed, depending on the theoretical background and descriptive context; these do not converge on a single definition.　: 13:618  Some specific definitions of the term "word" are employed to convey its different meanings at different levels of description, for example based on phonological, grammatical or orthographic basis. 　Others suggest that the concept is simply a convention used in everyday situations.　: 6  The concept of "word" is distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of language that has a meaning, even if it cannot stand on its own. 　Words are made out of at least one morpheme. 　Morphemes can also be joined to create other words in a process of morphological derivation.　: 768  In English and many other languages, the morphemes that make up a word generally include at least one root (such as "rock", "god", "type", "writ", "can", "not") and possibly some affixes ("-s", "un-", "-ly", "-ness"). 　Words with more than one root ("[type][writ]er", "[cow][boy]s", "[tele][graph]ically") are called compound words. 　In turn, words are combined to form other elements of language, such as phrases ("a red rock", "put up with"), clauses ("I threw a rock"), and sentences ("I threw a rock, but missed"). 　In many languages, the notion of what constitutes a "word" may be learned as part of learning the writing system. 　This is the case for the English language, and for most languages that are written with alphabets derived from the ancient Latin or Greek alphabets. 　In English orthography, the letter sequences "rock", "god", "write", "with", "the", and "not" are considered to be single-morpheme words, whereas "rocks", "ungodliness", "typewriter", and "cannot" are words composed of two or more morphemes ("rock"+"s", "un"+"god"+"li"+"ness", "type"+"writ"+"er", and "can"+"not").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)>Rock (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In geology, rock (or stone) is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. 　It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition, and the way in which it is formed. 　Rocks form the Earth's outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior, except for the liquid outer core and pockets of magma in the asthenosphere. 　The study of rocks involves multiple subdisciplines of geology, including petrology and mineralogy. 　It may be limited to rocks found on Earth, or it may include planetary geology that studies the rocks of other celestial objects. 　Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. 　Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth's crust, or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed. 　Sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis and lithification of sediments, which in turn are formed by the weathering, transport, and deposition of existing rocks. 　Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such high pressures and temperatures that they are transformed without significant melting. 　Humanity has made use of rocks since the earliest humans. 　This early period, called the Stone Age, saw the development of many stone tools. 　Stone was then used as a major component in the construction of buildings and early infrastructure. 　Mining developed to extract rocks from the Earth and obtain the minerals within them, including metals. 　Modern technology has allowed the development of new man-made rocks and rock-like substances, such as concrete.

You may need rendering support to display the Persian text in this article correctly. 　Green is the color between cyan and yellow on the visible spectrum. 　It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. 　In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. 　By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. 　Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. 　Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. 　During post-classical and early modern Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers, and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. 　For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red. 　It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. 　It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. 　It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries. 　In surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. 　In the European Union and the United States, green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health, but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. 　Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. 　Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. 　This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. 　Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David>David</a> 

<font size=3>
David (/ˈdeɪvɪd/; Hebrew: דָּוִד‎, Modern: Davīd, Tiberian: Dāwīḏ, "beloved one") was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the third king of the United Kingdom of Israel. 　Historians of the Ancient Near East agree that David probably lived around 1000 BCE, but little more is known about him as a historical figure. 　According to Jewish works such as the Seder Olam Rabbah, Seder Olam Zutta, and Sefer ha-Qabbalah, David ascended the throne as the king of Judah in 885 BCE. 　The Tel Dan stele, a Canaanite-inscribed stone that was erected by a king of Aram-Damascus in the late-9th/early-8th centuries BCE to commemorate a victory over two enemy kings, contains the Hebrew-language phrase Beit David (בית דוד‎), which is translated to "House of David" by most scholars. 　The Mesha stele, erected by king Mesha of Moab in the 9th century BCE, may also refer to the "House of David" although this is disputed. 　Apart from this, all that is known of David comes from biblical literature, the historicity of which has been extensively challenged, and there is little detail about David that is concrete and undisputed. 　In the biblical narrative of the Books of Samuel, David is described as a young shepherd and harpist who gains fame by killing Goliath. 　He becomes a favorite of Saul, the first king of Israel, but is forced to go into hiding when Saul becomes paranoid that David is trying to take his throne. 　After Saul and his son Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed king by the tribe of Judah and eventually all the tribes of Israel. 　He conquers Jerusalem, makes it the capital of a united Israel and brings the Ark of the Covenant to the city. 　He commits adultery with Bathsheba and arranges the death of her husband, Uriah the Hittite. 　David's son Absalom later tries to overthrow him, but David returns to Jerusalem after Absalom's death to continue his reign. 　David desires to build a temple to Yahweh but is denied because of the bloodshed in his reign. 　He dies at age 70 and chooses Solomon, his son with Bathsheba, as his successor instead of his eldest son Adonijah. 　David is honored as an ideal king and the forefather of the future Hebrew Messiah in Jewish prophetic literature and many psalms are attributed to him. 　David is also richly represented in post-biblical Jewish written and oral tradition and referenced in the New Testament. 　Early Christians interpreted the life of Jesus of Nazareth in light of references to the Hebrew Messiah and to David; Jesus is described as being directly descended from David in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. 　In the Quran and hadith, David is described as an Israelite king as well as a prophet of Allah. 　The biblical David has inspired many interpretations in art and literature over the centuries.

<font size=3>
A match is a tool for starting a fire. 　Typically, matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper. 　One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by friction generated by striking the match against a suitable surface. 　Wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes, and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks. 　The coated end of a match, known as the match "head", consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder, often colored for easier inspection. 　There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used. 　Because of the substance used to coat each match, this makes them non-biodegradable.

A girl is a young female human, usually a child or an adolescent. 　When a girl becomes an adult, she is accurately described as a woman. 　However, the term girl is also used for other meanings, including young woman, and is sometimes used as a synonym for daughter, or girlfriend.　[citation needed] In certain contexts, the usage of girl for a woman may be derogatory. 　Girl may also be a term of endearment used by an adult, usually a woman, to designate adult female friends. 　Girl also appears in portmanteaus (compound words) like showgirl, cowgirl, and schoolgirl. 　The treatment and status of girls in any society is usually closely related to the status of women in that culture. 　In cultures where women have a low societal position, girls may be unwanted by their parents, and the state may invest less in services for girls. 　Girls' upbringing ranges from being relatively the same as that of boys to complete sex segregation and completely different gender roles.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood>Blood</a> 

<font size=3>
Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. 　Blood in the circulatory system is also known as peripheral blood, and the blood cells it carries, peripheral blood cells. 　Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. 　Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. 　Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.　[citation needed] The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes), and in mammals platelets (also called thrombocytes). 　The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. 　These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas thereby increasing its solubility in blood. 　In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma. 　Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. 　Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. 　Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. 　In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen. 　Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. 　White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. 　Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. 　Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system. 　Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. 　In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. 　Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo-, hemato-, haemo- or haemato- from the Greek word αἷμα (haima) for "blood". 　In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean>Mean</a> 

<font size=3>
There are several kinds of mean in mathematics, especially in statistics. 　Each mean serves to summarize a given group of data, often to better understand the overall value (magnitude and sign) of a given data set. 　For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also known as "arithmetic average", is a measure of central tendency of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. 　The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar, x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} . 　If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean ( x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} ) to distinguish it from the mean, or expected value, of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted μ {\displaystyle \mu } or μ x {\displaystyle \mu _{x}} ). 　Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below.

<font size=3>
The self is an individual as the object of that individual’s own reflective consciousness. 　Since the self is a reference by a subject to the same subject, this reference is necessarily subjective. 　The sense of having a self—or selfhood—should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself. 　Ostensibly, this sense is directed outward from the subject to refer inward, back to its "self" (or itself). 　Examples of psychiatric conditions where such "sameness" may become broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occurs in schizophrenia: the self appears different from the subject. 　The first-person perspective distinguishes selfhood from personal identity. 　Whereas "identity" is (literally) sameness and may involve categorization and labeling, selfhood implies a first-person perspective and suggests potential uniqueness. 　Conversely, we use "person" as a third-person reference. 　Personal identity can be impaired in late-stage Alzheimer's disease and in other neurodegenerative diseases. 　Finally, the self is distinguishable from "others". 　Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience. 　Although subjective experience is central to selfhood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the Philosophy of self and scientific study of consciousness.

Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model. 　It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. 　The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 　Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. 　The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. 　An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. 　Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective. 　Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. 　The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. 　In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. 　In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. 　Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. 　In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. 　Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. 　Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union. 　Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. 　In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. 　The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration.

<font size=3>
A daughter is a female offspring; a girl or a woman in relation to her parents. 　Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter. 　The male counterpart is a son. 　Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements. 　From biological perspective, a daughter is a first degree relative. 　The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity. 　It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder. 　In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. 　A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide. 　In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price. 　The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman and is known as a dowry. 　The payment of a dowry can be found in societies where women do not labour outside the home.

<font size=3>
Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. 　Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. 　The history of social conflicts has often involved attempts to define and redefine rights. 　According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived".

A committee or commission is a body of one or more persons subordinate to a deliberative assembly. 　A committee is not itself considered to be a form of assembly. 　Usually, the assembly sends matters into a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the assembly itself were considering them. 　Committees may have different functions and their types of work differ depending on the type of the organization and its needs. 　A member of a legislature may be delegated a committee assignment, which gives them the right to serve on a certain committee.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake>Lake</a> 

<font size=3>
A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water localized in a basin surrounded by land, with much slower-moving flow than any inflow or outflow streams that serve to feed or drain the lake. 　Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing water reservoirs. 　Most lakes are freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater. 　Lakes are typically much larger and deeper than ponds, which also water-filled basins on land, although there are no official definitions or scientific criteria distinguishing the two. 　Most lakes are both fed and drained by creeks and rivers, but some lakes are endorheic without any outflowing drainage, while volcanic lakes are filled directly by precipitation runoffs and do not have any inflow streams. 　Lakes are also distinct from lagoons, which are shallow tidal pools dammed by sandbars at coastal regions. 　Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas (i.e. alpine lakes), dormant volcanic craters, rift zones and areas with ongoing glaciation. 　Other lakes are found in depressed landforms or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened over a basin formed by eroded floodplains and wetlands. 　Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. 　All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them. 　Artificially controlled lakes are known as reservoirs, and are usually constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydroelectric power generation, for supplying domestic drinking water, for ecological or recreational purposes, or for other human activities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future>Future</a> 

<font size=3>
The future is the time after the past and present. 　Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics. 　Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end. 　In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur. 　In special relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future light cone. 　In the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal. 　Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. 　Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future. 　Future studies, or futurology, is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures. 　Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures. 　Predeterminism is the belief that the past, present, and future have been already decided. 　The concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including art movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement futurism.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)>Function (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In evolutionary biology, function is the reason some object or process occurred in a system that evolved through natural selection. 　That reason is typically that it achieves some result, such as that chlorophyll helps to capture the energy of sunlight in photosynthesis. 　Hence, the organism that contains it is more likely to survive and reproduce, in other words the function increases the organism's fitness. 　A characteristic that assists in evolution is called an adaptation; other characteristics may be non-functional spandrels, though these in turn may later be co-opted by evolution to serve new functions. 　In biology, function has been defined in many ways. 　In physiology, it is simply what an organ, tissue, cell or molecule does. 　In the philosophy of biology, talk of function inevitably suggests some kind of teleological purpose, even though natural selection operates without any goal for the future. 　All the same, biologists often use teleological language as a shorthand for function. 　In contemporary philosophy of biology, there are three major accounts of function in the biological world: theories of causal role, selected effect, and goal contribution.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular>Particular</a> 

<font size=3>
In metaphysics, particulars or individuals are usually contrasted with universals. 　Universals concern features that can be exemplified by various different particulars. 　Particulars are often seen as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers. 　There are, however, theories of abstract particulars or tropes. 　For example, Socrates is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars). 　Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (for example a bicycle, an apple, and a given woman's hair can all be red). 　In nominalist view everything is particular. 　Universals in each moment of time from point of view of an observer is the collection of particulars that participates it (even a void collection).

<font size=3>
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. 　The primary functions which distinguish money are as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. 　Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possess intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. 　Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private", in the case of the United States dollar. 　The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). 　Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.

<font size=3>
A style, sometimes referred to as a crystalline style (though there are no other biological kinds), is a rod made of glycoprotein located in the midgut of most bivalves and some gastropods which aids in extracellular digestion. 　It consists of a protein matrix coated with digestive enzymes secreted by the style sac in the animal's stomach. 　When feeding, its projecting end is scraped against the stomach wall and abraded, thus releasing the enzymes. 　When subjected to starvation or desiccation, some bivalves have been known to re-ingest this organ.

<font size=3>
In typography, leading (/ˈlɛdɪŋ/ LED-ing) is the space between adjacent lines of type; the exact definition varies. 　In hand typesetting, leading is the thin strips of lead (or aluminium) that were inserted between lines of type in the composing stick to increase the vertical distance between them. 　The thickness of the strip is called leading and is equal to the difference between the size of the type and the distance from one baseline to the next. 　For instance, given a type size of 10 points and a distance between baselines of 12 points, the leading would be 2 points. 　The term is still used in modern page-layout software such as QuarkXPress, the Affinity Suite, and Adobe InDesign. 　Consumer-oriented word-processing software often talks of line spacing or, more accurately, interline spacing.

<font size=3>
A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other. 　The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. 　A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is termed a saltire in heraldic terminology. 　The cross has been widely recognized as a symbol of Christianity from an early period. 　However, the use of the cross as a religious symbol predates Christianity; in the ancient times it was a pagan religious symbol throughout Europe and western Asia. 　The effigy of a man hanging on a cross was set up in the fields to protect the crops. 　It often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage, as in Egyptian amulet Nefer with male cross and female orb, considered as an amulet of blessedness, a charm of sexual harmony.

An institute is an organisational body created for a certain purpose. 　They are often research organisations (research institutes) created to do research on specific topics, or can also be a professional body. 　In some countries, institutes can be part of a university or other institutions of higher education, either as a group of departments or an autonomous educational institution without a traditional university status such as a "university institute" (see Institute of Technology). 　In some countries, such as South Korea and India, private schools are sometimes referred to as institutes, and in Spain, secondary schools are referred to as institutes. 　Historically, in some countries institutes were educational units imparting vocational training and often incorporating libraries, also known as mechanics' institutes. 　The word "institute" comes from a Latin word institutum meaning "facility" or "habit"; from instituere meaning "build", "create", "raise" or "educate".

News is information about current events. 　This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. 　News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media. 　Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. 　Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. 　Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. 　Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. 　Having developed in China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. 　In the 20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. 　Whilst in the 21st, the internet has also begun to play a similar role.

In animal anatomy, the mouth, also known as the oral cavity, or in Latin cavum oriscode: lat promoted to code: la , is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds. 　It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal, bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx. 　In tetrapods, it contains the tongue and, except for some like birds, teeth. 　This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity, from the Latin buccacode: lat promoted to code: la ("cheek"). 　Some animal phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a complete digestive system, with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. 　Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes.

<font size=3>
In archaeology, natural is a term to denote a layer (stratum) in the stratigraphic record where there is no evidence of human impact on the environment. 　While there may be "natural" layers interbedded with archaeologically interesting layers, such as when a site was abandoned for long periods between occupations, the top (or horizon) of the natural layer below which there is no anthropogenic activity on site, and thus where the archaeological record begins, is the point to terminate digging. 　Usually it is the underlying geological makeup of the site that was formed by geologic processes. 　It is the goal of complete excavation to remove the entirety of the archaeological record all the way to the "natural", leaving only the natural deposits of pre-human activity on site. 　If the excavation is related to development, the impact assessment may stipulate excavation will cease at a certain depth, because the nature of the development will not disturb remains below a certain level. 　Such an excavation may not reach a natural or sterile layer.

Coordinates: 60°N 110°W﻿ / ﻿60°N 110°W﻿ / 60; -110 Canada is a country in North America. 　Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering over 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. 　Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border. 　Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. 　Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. 　Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. 　As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. 　In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. 　This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. 　This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. 　Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. 　The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. 　The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) at the federal level. 　It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. 　It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. 　Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. 　A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per capita income globally and the fifteenth-highest ranking on the Human Development Index. 　Its advanced economy is the eighth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. 　Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States.

Related is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on The WB from October 5, 2005, to March 20, 2006. 　It revolves around the lives of four close-knit sisters of Italian descent, raised in Brooklyn and living in Manhattan. 　The show was created by former Sex and the City writer Liz Tuccillo, and executive produced by Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman. 　Despite heavy promotion, initial ratings did not warrant the show being picked up for a second season when The WB network was folded into The CW.

<font size=3>
In hydrology, stage refers to the water level in a river or stream with respect to a chosen reference height. 　Stage is important because direct measurements of river discharge are very difficult while water surface elevation measurements are comparatively easy. 　In order to convert stage into discharge, scientists can use a combination of tracer studies, observations of high water marks, numerical modeling, and/or satellite or aerial photography. 　The relationship between stage and discharge is called a rating curve.

<font size=3>
In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are the results of thought. 　Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. 　Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. 　The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. 　In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. 　A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum>Quantum</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction. 　The fundamental notion that a physical property can be "quantized" is referred to as "the hypothesis of quantization". 　This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum. 　For example, a photon is a single quantum of light (or of any other form of electromagnetic radiation). 　Similarly, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values. 　(Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom.) 　Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of quantum mechanics. 　Quantization of energy and its influence on how energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature.

A floor is the bottom surface of a room or vehicle. 　Floors vary from simple dirt in a cave to many layered surfaces made with modern technology. 　Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal or any other material that can support the expected load. 　The levels of a building are often referred to as floors, although a more proper term is storey. 　Floors typically consist of a subfloor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface. 　In modern buildings the subfloor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in. 　As floors must meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict building codes in some regions.

In metrology (the science of measurement), a standard (or etalon) is an object, system, or experiment that bears a defined relationship to a unit of measurement of a physical quantity. 　Standards are the fundamental reference for a system of weights and measures, against which all other measuring devices are compared. 　Historical standards for length, volume, and mass were defined by many different authorities, which resulted in confusion and inaccuracy of measurements. 　Modern measurements are defined in relationship to internationally standardized reference objects, which are used under carefully controlled laboratory conditions to define the units of length, mass, electrical potential, and other physical quantities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest>Interest</a> 

<font size=3>
In finance and economics, interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. 　It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. 　It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs. 　For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. 　In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower. 　Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. 　(Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.) 　The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). 　Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. 　Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. 　In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis>Analysis</a> 

<font size=3>
Analysis (PL: analyses) is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. 　The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. 　The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analysis, "a breaking-up" or "an untying;" from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening"). 　From it also comes the word's plural, analyses. 　As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen, René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. 　It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name). 　The converse of analysis is synthesis: putting the pieces back together again in new or different whole.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running>Running</a> 

<font size=3>
Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. 　Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). 　This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. 　A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. 　The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. 　Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy. 　It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. 　Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. 　Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. 　Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.

<font size=3>
Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. 　Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. 　The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. 　Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts. 　Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. 　The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. 　This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. 　The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. 　Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council.

<font size=3>
In biological taxonomy, race is an informal rank in the taxonomic hierarchy for which various definitions exist. 　Sometimes it is used to denote a level below that of subspecies, while at other times it is used as a synonym for subspecies. 　It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one race. 　Races may be genetically distinct populations of individuals within the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, e.g. geographically, or physiologically. 　Genetic isolation between races is not complete, but genetic differences may have accumulated that are not (yet) sufficient to separate species. 　The term is recognized by some, but not governed by any of the formal codes of biological nomenclature. 　Taxonomic units below the level of subspecies are not typically applied to animals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week>Week</a> 

<font size=3>
A week is a unit of time equal to seven days. 　It is the standard time period used for short cycles of days in most parts of the world. 　The days are often used to indicate common work days and rest days, as well as days of worship. 　Weeks are often mapped against yearly calendars, but are typically not the basis for them, as weeks are not based on astronomy. 　The modern seven-day week can be traced back to the Babylonians, who used it within their calendar. 　Other ancient cultures had different week lengths, including ten in Egypt and an eight-day week for Etruscans. 　The Etruscan week was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but they later moved to a seven-day week, which had spread across Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. 　In 321 CE, Emperor Constantine officially decreed a seven-day week in the Roman Empire, including making Sunday a public holiday. 　This later spread across Europe, then the rest of the world. 　In English, the names of the days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 　In many languages, the days of the week are named after gods or planets visible to the eye. 　Such a week may be called a planetary week. 　Certain weeks within a year may be designated for a particular purpose, such as Holy Week in Christianity, Golden Week in China, and National Family Week in Canada. 　More informally, certain groups may advocate awareness weeks, which are designed to draw attention to a certain subject or cause. 　The term "week" may also be used to refer to a sub-section of the week, such as the workweek and weekend. 　Cultures vary in which days of the week are designated the first and the last, though virtually all have Saturday, Sunday or Monday as the first day. 　The Geneva-based ISO standards organization uses Monday as the first day of the week in its ISO week date system through the international ISO 8601 standard. 　Most of Europe and China consider Monday the first day of the week, most of North America and South Asia consider Sunday the first day, while Saturday is judged as the first day of the week in much of the Middle East and North Africa. 　Other regions are mixed, but typically observe either Sunday or Monday as the first day. 　The Jewish week ends with nightfall on Saturday, at the conclusion of the Sabbath, following the Hebrew Bible in which God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. 　Christians set their Sabbath to Sunday, so as not to coincide with Judaism. 　Muslims set their Sabbath to Friday so as not to coincide with either Judaism or Christianity.

Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. 　This makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. 　It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in a pure form. 　Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. 　It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. 　Gold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. 　It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. 　Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). 　Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. 　Gold is insoluble in nitric acid alone, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term 'acid test'. 　Gold dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. 　Gold also dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute, this is not a chemical reaction. 　A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history. 　In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy. 　Gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after the Nixon shock measures of 1971. 　In 2020, the world's largest gold producer was China, followed by Russia and Australia. 　A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020[update]. 　This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft). 　The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments and 10% in industry. 　Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion-resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). 　Gold is also used in infrared shielding, production of colored glass, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. 　Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.

<font size=3>
In the part of mathematics referred to as topology, a surface is a two-dimensional manifold. 　Some surfaces arise as the boundaries of three-dimensional solids; for example, the sphere is the boundary of the solid ball. 　Other surfaces arise as graphs of functions of two variables; see the figure at right. 　However, surfaces can also be defined abstractly, without reference to any ambient space. 　For example, the Klein bottle is a surface that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. 　Topological surfaces are sometimes equipped with additional information, such as a Riemannian metric or a complex structure, that connects them to other disciplines within mathematics, such as differential geometry and complex analysis. 　The various mathematical notions of surface can be used to model surfaces in the physical world.

A surface, as the term is most generally used, is the outermost or uppermost layer of a physical object or space. 　It is the portion or region of the object that can first be perceived by an observer using the senses of sight and touch, and is the portion with which other materials first interact. 　The surface of an object is more than "a mere geometric solid", but is "filled with, spread over by, or suffused with perceivable qualities such as color and warmth". 　The concept of surface has been abstracted and formalized in mathematics, specifically in geometry. 　Depending on the properties on which the emphasis is given, there are several non equivalent such formalizations, that are all called surface, sometimes with some qualifier, such as algebraic surface, smooth surface or fractal surface. 　The concept of surface and its mathematical abstraction are both widely used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects. 　For example, in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an airplane, the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface. 　The concept also raises certain philosophical questions—for example, how thick is the layer of atoms or molecules that can be considered part of the surface of an object (i.e., where does the "surface" end and the "interior" begin), and do objects really have a surface at all if, at the subatomic level, they never actually come in contact with other objects.

<font size=3>
China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia. 　It is the world's most populous country, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, slightly ahead of India. 　China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land, the most of any country in the world, tied with Russia. 　With an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometres (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third largest country by total land area. 　The country consists of 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). 　The national capital is Beijing, and the most populous city and largest financial center is Shanghai. 　Modern Chinese trace their origins to a cradle of civilization in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. 　The semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE and the well-attested Shang and Zhou dynasties developed a bureaucratic political system to serve hereditary monarchies, or dynasties. 　Chinese writing, Chinese classic literature, and the Hundred Schools of Thought emerged during this period and influenced China and its neighbors for centuries to come. 　In the third century BCE, Qin's wars of unification created the first Chinese empire, the short-lived Qin dynasty. 　The Qin was followed by the more stable Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), which established a model for nearly two millennia in which the Chinese empire was one of the world's foremost economic powers. 　The empire expanded, fractured, and reunified; was conquered and reestablished; absorbed foreign religions and ideas; and made world-leading scientific advances, such as the Four Great Inventions: gunpowder, paper, the compass, and printing. 　After centuries of disunity following the fall of the Han, the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties reunified the empire. 　The multi-ethnic Tang welcomed foreign trade and culture that came over the Silk Road and adapted Buddhism to Chinese needs. 　The early modern Song dynasty (960–1279) became increasingly urban and commercial. 　The civilian scholar-officials or literati used the examination system and the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism to replace the military aristocrats of earlier dynasties. 　The Mongol invasion established the Yuan dynasty in 1279, but the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) re-established Han Chinese control. 　The Manchu-led Qing dynasty nearly doubled the empire's territory and established a multi-ethnic state that was the basis of the modern Chinese nation, but suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century. 　The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. 　In its early years as a republic, the country underwent a period of instability known as the "Warlord Era" before mostly reunifying in 1928 under a Nationalist government. 　A civil war between the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began in 1927. 　Japan invaded China in 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War and temporarily halting the civil war. 　The surrender and expulsion of Japanese forces from China in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country, which led to renewed fighting between the CCP and the Kuomintang. 　The civil war ended in 1949 with the division of Chinese territory; the CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan. 　Both claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, although the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971. 　From 1959 to 1961, the PRC implemented an economic and social campaign called the "Great Leap Forward" that resulted in a sharp economic decline and an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths, mostly through man-made famine. 　From 1966 to 1976, the turbulent period of political and social chaos within China known as the Cultural Revolution led to greater economic and educational decline, with millions being purged or subjected to either persecution or "politicide" based on political categories. 　Since then, the Chinese government has rebuked some of the earlier Maoist policies, conducting a series of political and economic reforms since 1978 that have greatly raised Chinese standards of living, and increased life expectancies. 　China is currently governed as a unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic by the CCP. 　China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the RCEP. 　It is also a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit. 　It ranks among the lowest in measurements of democracy, civil liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and the human rights of ethnic minorities. 　The Chinese authorities have been criticized by human rights activists and non-governmental organizations for human rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass surveillance of their citizens, and violent suppression of protest and dissent. 　Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. 　The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. 　China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget. 　China is considered to be a potential superpower due to its high level of innovation, economic potential, growing military strength, and influence in international affairs.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel>Novel</a> 

<font size=3>
A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, typically written in prose and published as a book. 　The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new". 　Some novelists, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Ann Radcliffe, John Cowper Powys, preferred the term "romance" to describe their novels. 　According to Margaret Doody, the novel has "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", with its origins in the Ancient Greek and Roman novel, in Chivalric romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella. 　The ancient romance form was revived by Romanticism, especially the historical romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novel. 　Some, including M. H. Abrams and Walter Scott, have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society, while the romance encompasses any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents. 　Works of fiction that include marvellous or uncommon incidents are also novels, including The Lord of the Rings, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Frankenstein. 　"Romances" are works of fiction whose main emphasis is on marvellous or unusual incidents, and should not be confused with the romance novel, a type of genre fiction that focuses on romantic love. 　Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel based on its early use of the experience of intimacy in a narrative form, but there is considerable debate over this — there were certainly long fictional prose works that preceded it. 　Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1616-1911). 　An early example from Europe was written in Muslim Spain by the Sufi writer Ibn Tufayl entitled Hayy ibn Yaqdhan. 　Later developments occurred after the invention of the printing press. 　Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era. 　Literary historian Ian Watt, in The Rise of the Novel (1957), argued that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century. 　Recent technological developments have led to many novels also being published in non-print media: this includes audio books, web novels, and ebooks. 　Another non-traditional fiction format can be found in some graphic novels. 　While these comic book versions of works of fiction have their origins in the 19th century, they have only become popular more recently.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning>Learning</a> 

<font size=3>
Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. 　The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. 　Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. 　The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved. 　Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before in terms of an embryo's need for both interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb.) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment. 　The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/accidents, or in collaborative learning health systems). 　Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. 　For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals. 　Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. 　Learning that an aversive event cannot be avoided or escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness. 　There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development. 　Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning. 　Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. 　Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games. 　For Vygotsky, however, play is the first form of learning language and communication, and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and symbols. 　This has led to a view that learning in organisms is always related to semiosis, and often associated with representational systems/activity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature>Nature</a> 

<font size=3>
Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 　"Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 　The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. 　Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. 　The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". 　In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord. 　The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since. 　During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. 　With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 　However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. 　Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. 　Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. 　It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. 　For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". 　This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. 　Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.

<font size=3>
A festival is an extraordinary event celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect or aspects of that community and its religion or cultures. 　It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. 　A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship. 　Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural. 　Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. 　Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern. 　Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they are called patronal festivals. 　They may also provide entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. 　Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among families. 　Attendants of festivals are often motivated by a desire for escapism, socialization and camaraderie; the practice has been seen as a means of creating geographical connection, belonging and adaptability.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property>Property</a> 

<font size=3>
Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves. 　Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away, or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it under the granted property rights. 　In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property). 　Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. 　However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional,[citation needed] to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. 　The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of a dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, it's or their own will to be sufficient and absolute. 　The first Restatement defines property as anything, tangible or intangible, whereby a legal relationship between persons and the State enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. 　This mediating relationship between individual, property, and State is called a property regime. 　In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. 　The distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object. 　Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the ground), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (State-owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc.). 　However, the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced. 　An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. 　A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.　[citation needed] The unqualified term "property" is often used to refer specifically to real property.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security>Security</a> 

<font size=3>
Security is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercive) caused by others, by restraining the freedom of others to act. 　Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be of persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change. 　Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g. freedom from want); as the presence of an essential good (e.g. food security); as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g. a secure telephone line); as containment (e.g. a secure room or cell); and as a state of mind (e.g. emotional security). 　The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security (security company, security forces, security guard, cyber security systems, security cameras, remote guarding). 　Security can be physical and virtual. 　On a governance level, security is a defining characteristic of a society as a fundamental function of the state, and a necessary condition to allow the enjoyment and exercise of rights and freedoms pursued by the rule of law.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital>Hospital</a> 

<font size=3>
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment. 　The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. 　A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. 　Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. 　Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. 　Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received. 　A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students and auxiliary healthcare students. 　A health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. 　Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. 　Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. 　Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology. 　Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. 　Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders. 　Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. 　However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals. 　In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original "places of hospitality", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor>Professor</a> 

<font size=3>
Professor (commonly abbreviated as Prof.) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. 　Literally, professor derives from Latin as a "person who professes". 　Professors are usually experts in their field and teachers of the highest rank. 　In most systems of academic ranks, "professor" as an unqualified title refers only to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as "full professor". 　In some countries and institutions, the word "professor" is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor; this is particularly the case in the United States, where the unqualified word is also used colloquially to refer to associate and assistant professors as well. 　This usage would be considered incorrect among other academic communities. 　However, the otherwise unqualified title "Professor" designated with a capital letter nearly always refers to a full professor. 　Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate, professional, or postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise. 　In universities with graduate schools, professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation. 　In many universities, full professors take on senior managerial roles such as leading departments, research teams and institutes, and filling roles such as president, principal or vice-chancellor. 　The role of professor may be more public-facing than that of more junior staff, and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise.

<font size=3>
A question is an utterance which serves as a request for information. 　Questions are sometimes distinguished from interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to express them. 　Rhetorical questions, for instance, are interrogative in form but may not be considered bona fide questions, as they are not expected to be answered. 　Questions come in a number of varieties. 　Polar questions are those such as the English example "Is this a polar question?", which can be answered with "yes" or "no". 　Alternative questions such as "Is this a polar question, or an alternative question?" present a list of possibilities to choose from. 　Open questions such as "What kind of question is this?" allow many possible resolutions. 　Questions are widely studied in linguistics and philosophy of language. 　In the subfield of pragmatics, questions are regarded as illocutionary acts which raise an issue to be resolved in discourse. 　In approaches to formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics, questions are regarded as the denotations of interrogatives, and are typically identified as sets of the propositions which answer them.

A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something. 　It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal. 　For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map. 　Plans can be formal or informal: Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. 　In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money. 　Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits. 　The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. 　For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories. 　It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. 　More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. 　This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longer>Longer</a> 

<font size=3>
"Longer" is a song written and recorded by the American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg and released in 1979 by Full Moon Records and Epic Records. 　The song can be found on Fogelberg's 1979 album Phoenix. 　It was also included on his 1982 greatest hits album as well as various other retrospective and compilation recordings. 　Fogelberg, who had released more rock oriented songs throughout the 1970s, jokingly described "Longer" in the liner notes to one of his retrospective albums as "the song that put me on the elevators." 　He wrote the song while vacationing in Maui, "lounging in a hammock one night and looking up at the stars. It just seems this song was drifting around the universe, saw me, and decided I'd give it a good home." 　Accompanying Fogelberg's vocals is an acoustic guitar (played by the singer) as well as a flugelhorn solo by Jerry Hey. 　Lyrically, the song compares various events ("Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens") with his emotional attachment to the one he loves ("I've been in love with you").

In archaeology, a phase refers to the logical reduction of contexts recorded during excavation to nearly contemporary archaeological horizons that represent a distinct "phase" of previous land use. 　These often but not always will be a representation of a former land surface or occupation level and all associated features that were created into or from this point in time. 　A simplified description of phase would be that "a phase is a view of a given archaeological site as it would have been at time X". 　Examples of phases that would have no associated occupation surfaces are phases of a site that have been horizontally truncated by later phases and only elements surviving of the truncated phase are those that were below ground level and the subsequent truncation at that time. 　Subsequent or earlier phases are representations in changing occupation patterns and land use over time. 　Phase is an extremely important concept in archeological excavation and post-excavation work. 　Phasing is achieved by compiling smaller groups of contexts together through the use of stratification and stratigraphic excavation into ever larger units of understanding. 　The terminology of these sub-units or collections of contexts varies depending on practitioner, but the terms interface, sub-group, group, and feature are common. 　Phasing a site has a slightly different meaning from "digging in phase". 　Digging in phase is the process of stratigraphic removal of archaeological remains not to avoid removing contexts that are earlier in time lower in the sequence before other contexts that have a latter physical stratigraphic relationship to them. 　Digging a site "in phase" is considered good practice and can be thought of as the process of removing the deposits on site in the reverse order that they arrived. 　Phasing is achieved on site by many methods including intuition and experience, but the main analytical tool post excavation is the Harris matrix. 　Phase is sometimes termed differently depending on practitioner, examples include the term period but in the main phase is universal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe>Europe</a> 

<font size=3>
Europe is a continent that is part of Eurasia and is located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. 　Comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. 　It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. 　Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. 　Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). 　Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. 　Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021. 　The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. 　Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast. 　European culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. 　The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. 　Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. 　Since the Age of Discovery, started by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. 　Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia. 　The Age of Enlightenment, the subsequent French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. 　The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. 　Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence. 　During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East, until the Revolutions of 1989, Fall of the Berlin Wall and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. 　In 1949, the Council of Europe was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. 　Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation. 　The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. 　The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls between most of its member states, and some non-member states. 　There exists a political movement favouring the evolution of the European Union into a single federation encompassing much of the continent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_(geology)>Bed (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In geology, a bed is a layer of sediment, sedimentary rock, or pyroclastic material "bounded above and below by more or less well-defined bedding surfaces". 　Specifically in sedimentology, a bed can be defined in one of two major ways. 　First, Campbell and Reineck and Singh use the term bed to refer to a thickness-independent layer comprising a coherent layer of sedimentary rock, sediment, or pyroclastic material bounded above and below by surfaces known as bedding planes. 　By this definition of bed, laminae are small beds that constitute the smallest (visible) layers of a hierarchical succession and often, but not always, internally comprise a bed. 　Alternatively, a bed can be defined by thickness where a bed is a coherent layer of sedimentary rock, sediment, or pyroclastic material greater than 1 cm thick and a lamina is a coherent layer of sedimentary rock, sediment, or pyroclastic material less than 1 cm thick. 　This method of defining bed versus lamina is frequently used in textbooks, e.g., Collinson & Mountney or Miall. 　Both definitions have merit and the choice of which one to use will depend on the focus of the specific study on a case by case basis. 　In geology, a bedding surface is either a planar, nearly planar, to wavy or curved 3-dimensional surface that visibly separates each successive bed (of the same or different lithology) from the preceding or following bed. 　Where bedding surfaces occur as cross-sections, e.g., in a 2-dimensional vertical cliff face of horizontal strata, are often referred to as bedding contacts. 　Within conformable successions, each bedding surface acted as the depositional surface for the accumulation of younger sediment. 　Typically, but not always, bedding surfaces record changes in either the rate or type of accumulating sediment that created the underlying bed. 　Typically, they represent either a period of nondeposition, erosional truncation, shift in flow or sediment regime, abrupt change in composition, or combination of these as a result of changes in environmental conditions. 　As a result, a bed is typically, but not always, interpreted to represent a single period of time when sediments or pyroclastic material accumulated during uniform and steady paleoenvironmental conditions. 　However, some bedding surfaces may be postdepositional features either formed or enhanced by diagenetic processes or weathering. 　The relationship between bedding surfaces controls the gross geometry of a bed. 　Most commonly, the bottom and top surfaces of beds are subparallel to parallel to each other. 　However, some bedding surfaces of a bed are nonparallel, e.g., wavy, or curved. 　Differing combinations of nonparallel bedding surfaces results in beds of widely varying geometric shapes such as uniform-tabular, tabular-lenticular, curved-tabular, wedge-shaped, and irregular beds. 　Types of beds include cross-beds and graded beds. 　Cross-beds, or "sets," are not layered horizontally and are formed by a combination of local deposition on the inclined surfaces of ripples or dunes, and local erosion. 　Graded beds show a gradual change in grain or clast sizes from one side of the bed to the other. 　A normal grading occurs where there are larger grain sizes on the older side, while an inverse grading occurs where there are smaller grain sizes on the older side.

<font size=3>
A bed is an item of furniture that is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax. 　Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. 　The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. 　Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. 　Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. 　While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, the trundle bed, which is stored under a low, twin-sized bed and can be rolled out to create a larger sleeping area, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. 　Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. 　Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. 　Other beds are made specifically for animals. 　Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards. 　"Headboard only" beds may incorporate a "dust ruffle", "bed skirt", or "valance sheet" to hide the bed frame. 　To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress. 　Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet, collectively referred to as bedding. 　Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.

<font size=3>
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability. 　While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. 　Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. 　The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. 　Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. 　Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds. 　The atmosphere of Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. 　Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. 　Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. 　More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. 　A region's climate is governed not only by latitude but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. 　In most areas, severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, occurs and greatly impacts life. 　Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. 　It is the densest planet in the Solar System. 　Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. 　Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. 　The Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). 　The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. 　Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. 　Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation. 　Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. 　During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. 　Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. 　Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of 8 billion today. 　Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. 　Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other life, causing widespread extinctions.

The name Robert is an ancient Germanic given name, from Proto-Germanic *Hrōþi- "fame" and *berhta- "bright" 　(Hrōþiberhtaz). 　Compare Old Dutch Robrecht and Old High German Hrodebert 　(a compound of Hruod 　(Old Norse: Hróðr) 　"fame, glory, honour, praise, renown" and berht "bright, light, shining"). 　It is the second most frequently used given name of ancient Germanic origin. 　It is also in use as a surname. 　Another commonly used form of the name is Rupert. 　After becoming widely used in Continental Europe it entered England in its Old French form Robert, where an Old English cognate form (Hrēodbēorht, Hrodberht, Hrēodbēorð, Hrœdbœrð, Hrœdberð, Hrōðberχtŕ) had existed before the Norman Conquest. 　The feminine version is Roberta. 　The Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish form is Roberto. 　Robert is also a common name in many Germanic languages, including English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Scots, Danish, and Icelandic. 　It can be used as a French, Polish, Irish, Finnish, Romanian, and Estonian name as well.

In biology, a kingdom is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. 　Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. 　Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States and Canada used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaebacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Greece, Brazil and other countries use five kingdoms only (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). 　Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term kingdom, noting that some traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, meaning that they do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. 　The terms flora (for plants), fauna (for animals), and, in the 21st century, funga (for fungi) are also used for life present in a particular region or time.

Brown is a color. 　It can be considered a composite color, but it is mainly a darker shade of orange. 　In the CMYK color model used in printing and painting, brown is usually made by combining the colors orange and black. 　In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown combines red and green. 　The color brown is seen widely in nature, wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. 　Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil. 　According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; it is often associated with plainness, the rustic, feces, and poverty, although it does also have positive associations include baking, warmth, wildlife, and the autumn.

<font size=3>
In geology, a complex is a lithodemic unit consisting of two or more lithodemes of more than one genetic class (metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary). 　The law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. 　Such bodies of rock are described as lithodemic and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. 　The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal term lithodeme, which is comparable to a formation. 　A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. 　A complex is a group of two or more lithodemes of more than one genetic classes. 　It differs from a suite, which is a group of two or more lithodemes of the same genetic class.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size>Size</a> 

<font size=3>
Size in general is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing. 　More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume. 　Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range. 　In mathematical terms, "size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter". 　Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. 　Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches. 　The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight. 　These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes. 　The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.

<font size=3>
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. 　Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets. 　Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. 　Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. 　In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords. 　Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. 　In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties – notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries. 　The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).

<font size=3>
Charles is a masculine given name predominantly found in English and French speaking countries. 　It is from the French form Charles of the Proto-Germanic name ᚲᚨᚱᛁᛚᚨᛉ (in runic alphabet) or *karilaz (in Latin alphabet), whose meaning was "free man". 　The Old English descendant of this word was Ċearl or Ċeorl, as the name of King Cearl of Mercia, that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England. 　The name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as Karolus (as in Vita Karoli Magni), later also as Carolus. 　Some Germanic languages, for example Dutch and German, have retained the word in two separate senses. 　In the particular case of Dutch, Karel refers to the given name, whereas the noun kerel means "a bloke, fellow, man".

Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way. 　The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,: 117  including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. 　Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life. 　Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. 　The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. 　The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. 　More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy. 　While technology contributes to economic development and improve human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or may cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. 　As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate potential downsides.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(topology)>Base (topology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a base (or basis) for the topology τ of a topological space (X, τ) is a family B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} of open subsets of X such that every open set of the topology is equal to the union of some sub-family of B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} . 　For example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a basis for the Euclidean topology on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } can be written as a union of some family of open intervals. 　Bases are ubiquitous throughout topology. 　The sets in a base for a topology, which are called basic open sets, are often easier to describe and use than arbitrary open sets. 　Many important topological definitions such as continuity and convergence can be checked using only basic open sets instead of arbitrary open sets. 　Some topologies have a base of open sets with specific useful properties that may make checking such topological definitions easier. 　Not all families of subsets of a set X {\displaystyle X} form a base for a topology on X {\displaystyle X} . 　Under some conditions detailed below, a family of subsets will form a base for a (unique) topology on X {\displaystyle X} , obtained by taking all possible unions of subfamilies. 　Such families of sets are very frequently used to define topologies. 　A weaker notion related to bases is that of a subbase for a topology. 　Bases for topologies are also closely related to neighborhood bases.
