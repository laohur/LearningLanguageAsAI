<font size=3>
Determination is a positive emotional feeling that involves persevering towards a difficult goal in spite of obstacles. 　Determination occurs prior to goal attainment and serves to motivate behavior that will help achieve one's goal. 　Empirical research suggests that people consider determination to be an emotion; in other words, determination is not just a cognitive state, but rather an affective state. 　In the psychology literature, researchers have studied determination under other terms, including challenge and anticipatory enthusiasm; this may explain one reason for the relative lack of research on determination compared to other positive emotions. 　In the field of psychology, emotion research is heavily focused on negative emotions and the action tendencies that they encourage. 　However, recent work in positive psychology incorporates the study of determination as a positive emotion that pushes individuals toward action and results in important outcomes such as perseverance and determination take success.

<font size=3>
A holiday is a day or other period of time set aside for festivals or recreation. 　Public holidays are set by public authorities and vary by state or region. 　Religious holidays are set by religious organisations for their members and are often also observed as public holidays in religious majority countries. 　Some religious holidays such as Christmas have become or are becoming secularised by part or all of those who observe it. 　In addition to secularisation, many holidays have become commercialised due to the growth of industry. 　Holidays can be thematic, celebrating or commemorating particular groups, events or ideas, or non-thematic, days of rest which do not have any particular meaning. 　In Commonwealth English, the term can refer to any period of rest from work, such as vacations or school holidays. 　In American English, the holidays typically refers to the period from Thanksgiving to New Year's, which contains many important holidays in American culture.

In geology, the term "tension" refers to a stress which stretches rocks in two opposite directions. 　The rocks become longer in a lateral direction and thinner in a vertical direction. 　One important result of tensile stress is jointing in rocks. 　However, tensile stress is rare because most subsurface stress is compressive, due to the weight of the overburden.

<font size=3>
Purple is any of a variety of colors with hue between red and blue. 　In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, purples are produced by mixing red and blue light. 　In the RYB color model historically used by painters, purples are created with a combination of red and blue pigments. 　In the CMYK color model used in printing, purples are made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment, black pigment, or both. 　Purple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye, made from the mucus secretion of a species of snail, was extremely expensive in antiquity. 　Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. 　Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy. 　According to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States, purple is the color most often associated with rarity, royalty, magic, mystery, and piety. 　When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.

<font size=3>
Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. 　Advertising aims to put a product or service in the spotlight in hopes of drawing it attention from consumers. 　It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are wide range of uses, the most common being the commercial advertisement. 　Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. 　On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. 　Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. 　Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. 　Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. 　In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. 　Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster-girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. 　Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising. 　Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. 　Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor and 4.3% on radio. 　Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu. 　In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan>Taiwan</a> 
<font size=3>
Coordinates: 24°N 121°E﻿ / ﻿24°N 121°E﻿ / 24; 121 Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a country in East Asia. 　It is located at the junction of the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the northwest, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. 　The territories controlled by the ROC consist of 168 islands, with a combined area of 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 sq mi). 　The main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. 　The capital, Taipei, forms along with New Taipei City and Keelung the largest metropolitan area of Taiwan. 　Other major cities include Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. 　With around 23.9 million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries in the world. 　Taiwan has been settled for at least 25,000 years. 　Ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around 6,000 years ago. 　In the 17th century, large-scale Han Chinese (specifically the Hakkas and Hoklos) immigration to western Taiwan began under a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning, the first predominantly Han Chinese state in Taiwanese history. 　The island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. 　The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing in 1911, took control of Taiwan following the surrender of Japan in 1945. 　Japan would renounce sovereignty over Taiwan in 1952. 　The immediate resumption of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the loss of the Chinese mainland to Communist forces who established the People's Republic of China, and the flight of the ROC central government to Taiwan in 1949. 　The effective jurisdiction of the ROC has since been limited to Taiwan, Penghu, and smaller islands. 　In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the "Taiwan Miracle". 　In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party state under martial law to a multi-party democracy, with democratically elected presidents since 1996. 　Taiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the 21st-largest in the world by nominal GDP and 19th-largest by PPP measures, with a focus on steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing. 　Taiwan is a developed country, ranking 20th on GDP per capita. 　It is ranked highly in terms of civil liberties, healthcare, and human development. 　The political status of Taiwan is contentious. 　The ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations, after UN members voted in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead. 　The ROC maintained its claim of being the sole legitimate representative of China and its territory, although this has been downplayed since its democratization in the 1990s. 　Taiwan is claimed by the PRC, which refuses diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC. 　Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with 13 out of 193 UN member states and the Holy See, though many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. 　International organisations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only on a non-state basis under various names. 　Domestically, the major political contention is between parties favouring eventual Chinese unification and promoting a pan-Chinese identity, contrasted with those aspiring to formal international recognition and promoting a Taiwanese identity; into the 21st century, both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration>Consideration</a> 
<font size=3>
Look up consideration in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Consideration is a concept of English common law and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by deed). 　The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions. 　The court in Currie v Misa declared consideration to be a “Right, Interest, Profit, Benefit, or Forbearance, Detriment, Loss, Responsibility”. 　Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. 　Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right. 　Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into contracts. 　Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as "consideration": for example, if A contracts to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the promise of $5,000, and B's consideration is the promise of the car. 　Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own house in any other colour than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also a consideration. 　Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. 　A's consideration to B is the forbearance in painting his own house in a colour other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. 　Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. 　However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it is a valid gift. 　In common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. 　The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. 　If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed. 　However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of quantum meruit (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or promissory estoppel.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack>Soundtrack</a> 
<font size=3>
A soundtrack is recorded music accompanying and synchronised to the images of a motion picture, drama, book, television program, radio program, or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film, video, or television presentation; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronised recorded sound. 　In movie industry terminology usage, a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production. 　Initially, the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a film each has its own separate track (dialogue track, sound effects track, and music track), and these are mixed together to make what is called the composite track, which is heard in the film. 　A dubbing track is often later created when films are dubbed into another language. 　This is also known as an M&E (music and effects) track. 　M&E tracks contain all sound elements minus dialogue, which is then supplied by the foreign distributor in the native language of its territory. 　Current dictionary entries for soundtrack document soundtrack as a noun, and as verb. 　An early attempt at popularizing the term “sound track” was printed in the magazine Photoplay in 1929. 　A 1992 technical dictionary entry in Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology does not distinguish between the form sound track and soundtrack. 　The contraction soundtrack came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called "soundtrack albums" in the late 1940s. 　First conceived by movie companies as a promotional gimmick for new films, these commercially available recordings were labeled and advertised as "music from the original motion picture soundtrack", or "music from and inspired by the motion picture." 　These phrases were soon shortened to just "original motion picture soundtrack." 　More accurately, such recordings are made from a film's music track, because they usually consist of isolated music from a film, not the composite (sound) track with dialogue and sound effects. 　The abbreviation OST is often used to describe the musical soundtrack on a recorded medium, such as CD, and it stands for original soundtrack; however, it is sometimes also used to differentiate the original music heard and recorded versus a rerecording or cover.

<font size=3>
Debt is an obligation that requires one party, the debtor, to pay money or other agreed-upon value to another party, the creditor. 　Debt is a deferred payment, or series of payments, which differentiates it from an immediate purchase. 　The debt may be owed by sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. 　Commercial debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. 　Loans, bonds, notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. 　In financial accounting, debt is a type of financial transaction, as distinct from equity. 　The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on a monetary value. 　For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a "debt of gratitude" to the second person.

<font size=3>
In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. 　It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. 　Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere. 　In more modern usage, the length d {\displaystyle d} of a diameter is also called the diameter. 　In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r . 　{\displaystyle r.　} d = 2 r or equivalently r = d 2 . 　{\displaystyle d=2r\qquad {\text{or equivalently}}\qquad r={\frac {d}{2}}.　} For a convex shape in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to its boundary, and the width is often defined to be the smallest such distance. 　Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating calipers. 　For a curve of constant width such as the Reuleaux triangle, the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance. 　For an ellipse, the standard terminology is different. 　A diameter of an ellipse is any chord passing through the centre of the ellipse. 　For example, conjugate diameters have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the conjugate diameter. 　The longest diameter is called the major axis. 　The word "diameter" is derived from Ancient Greek: διάμετρος (diametros), "diameter of a circle", from διά (dia), "across, through" and μέτρον (metron), "measure". 　It is often abbreviated DIA , dia , d , {\displaystyle {\text{DIA}},{\text{dia}},d,} or ∅ . 　{\displaystyle \varnothing .　}

<font size=3>
Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. 　Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. 　It is one of the plastic arts. 　Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. 　A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast. 　Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. 　However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost. 　Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. 　Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa. 　The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. 　During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. 　The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David. 　Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment>Punishment</a> 
<font size=3>
Punishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority—in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. 　It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is. 　The reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law—and respect for rule of law—under which the social group is governed. 　Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion. 　The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable. 　The individual may be a person, or even an animal. 　The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family. 　Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. 　The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called "correctional process". 　Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention. 　Justifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. 　The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult. 　If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than "punishment" may be considered more accurate. 　Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority or not on the basis of a breach of rules is typically considered only revenge or spite rather than punishment. 　In addition, the word "punishment" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences "punishment" during a fight. 　In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. 　Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment. 　Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty. 　Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor. 　Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense. 　Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment_(psychology)>Punishment (psychology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In operant conditioning, punishment is any change in a human or animal's surroundings which, occurring after a given behavior or response, reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. 　As with reinforcement, it is the behavior, not the human/animal, that is punished. 　Whether a change is or is not punishing is determined by its effect on the rate that the behavior occurs. 　This is called motivating operations (MO), because they alter the effectiveness of a stimulus. 　MO can be categorized in abolishing operations, decrease the effectiveness of the stimuli and establishing, increase the effectiveness of the stimuli. 　For example, a painful stimulus which would act as a punisher for most people may actually reinforce some behaviors of masochistic individuals. 　There are two types of punishment, positive and negative. 　Positive punishment involves the introduction of a stimulus to decrease behavior while negative punishment involves the removal of a stimulus to decrease behavior. 　While similar to reinforcement, punishment's goal is to decrease behaviors while reinforcement's goal is to increase behaviors. 　Different kinds of stimuli exist as well. 　There are rewarding stimuli which are considered pleasant and aversive stimuli, which are considered unpleasant. 　There are also two types of punishers. 　There are primary punishers which directly affect the individual such as pain and are a natural response and then there are secondary punishers which are things that are learned to be negative like a buzzing sound when getting an answer wrong on a game show. 　Conflicting findings have been found on the effectiveness of the use of punishment. 　Some have found that punishment can be a useful tool in suppressing behavior while some have found it to have a weak effect on suppressing behavior. 　Punishment can also lead to lasting negative unintended side effects as well. 　Punishment has been found to be effective in countries that are wealthy, high in trust, cooperation, and democracy. 　Punishment has been used in a lot of different applications. 　Punishment has been used in applied behavioral analysis, specifically in situations to try and punish dangerous behaviors like head banging. 　Punishment has also been used to psychologically manipulate individuals to gain control over victims. 　It has also been used in scenarios where an abuser may try punishment in order to traumatically bond their victim with them. 　Stuttering therapy has also seen the use of punishment with effective results. 　Certain punishment techniques have been effective in children with disabilities, such as autism and intellectual disabilities.

<font size=3>
A scientist is a person who researches to advance knowledge in an area of the natural sciences. 　By modern definitions, many scientists are required to have advanced degrees in an area of science and careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofits pertaining to their discipline. 　In classical antiquity, there was no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. 　Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. 　Though Thales (circa 624–545 BC) was arguably the first scientist for describing how cosmic events may be seen as natural, not necessarily caused by gods, it was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.

<font size=3>
Stochastic (/stəˈkæstɪk/, from Greek στόχος (stókhos) 'aim, guess') refers to the property of being well described by a random probability distribution. 　Although stochasticity and randomness are distinct in that the former refers to a modeling approach and the latter refers to phenomena themselves, these two terms are often used synonymously. 　Furthermore, in probability theory, the formal concept of a stochastic process is also referred to as a random process. 　Stochasticity is used in many different fields, including the natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, and physics, as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography, and telecommunications. 　It is also used in finance, due to seemingly random changes in financial markets as well as in medicine, linguistics, music, media, colour theory, botany, manufacturing, and geomorphology.

<font size=3>
In ecology, the term habitat summarises the array of resources, physical and biotic factors that are present in an area, such as to support the survival and reproduction of a particular species. 　A species habitat can be seen as the physical manifestation of its ecological niche. 　Thus "habitat" is a species-specific term, fundamentally different from concepts such as environment or vegetation assemblages, for which the term "habitat-type" is more appropriate. 　The physical factors may include (for example): soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity. 　Biotic factors will include the availability of food and the presence or absence of predators. 　Every species has particular habitat requirements, with habitat generalist species able to thrive in a wide array of environmental conditions while habitat specialist species requiring a very limited set of factors to survive. 　The habitat of a species is not necessarily found in a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss; a parasitic organism has as its habitat the body of its host, part of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a single cell within the host's body. 　Habitat types are environmental categorizations of different environments based on the characteristics of a given geographical area, particularly vegetation and climate. 　Thus habitat types do not refer to a single species but to multiple species living in the same area. 　For example, terrestrial habitat types include forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. 　Fresh-water habitat types include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds; marine habitat types include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, estuaries, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents. 　Habitat types may change over time. 　Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents); or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. 　Other changes come as a direct result of human activities, such as deforestation, the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. 　The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife – through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity.

<font size=3>
A blade is the portion of a tool, weapon, or machine with an edge that is designed to puncture, chop, slice or scrape surfaces or materials. 　Blades are typically made from materials that are harder than those they are to be used on. 　Historically, humans have made blades from flaking stones such as flint or obsidian, and from various metal such as copper, bronze and iron. 　Modern blades are often made of steel or ceramic. 　Blades are one of humanity's oldest tools, and continue to be used for combat, food preparation, and other purposes. 　Blades work by concentrating force on the cutting edge. 　Certain blades, such as those used on bread knives or saws, are serrated, further concentrating force on the point of each tooth.
