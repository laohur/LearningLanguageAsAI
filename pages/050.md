## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid>Liquid</a> 
<font size=3>
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. 　As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. 　A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. 　Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. 　Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. 　Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. 　A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. 　Water is by far the most common liquid on Earth. 　The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than that of a gas. 　Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. 　On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. 　Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. 　Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or plasma from within stars.

<font size=3>
A shore or a shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake. 　In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, representing the intertidal zone where there is one. 　In contrast to a coast, a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an ocean or a sea. 　Therefore, in that sense, a coast is a type of shore. 　However, the word "coast" often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior. 　Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, such as waves. 　The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal>Coal</a> 
<font size=3>
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. 　Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. 　Coal is a type of fossil fuel, formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. 　Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands called coal forests that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times. 　Many significant coal deposits are younger than this and originate from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. 　Coal is used primarily as a fuel. 　While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited until the Industrial Revolution. 　With the invention of the steam engine, coal consumption increased. 　In 2020, coal supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and over a third of its electricity. 　Some iron and steel-making and other industrial processes burn coal. 　The extraction and use of coal causes premature death and illness. 　The use of coal damages the environment, and it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. 　Fourteen billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted by burning coal in 2020, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and over 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. 　As part of worldwide energy transition, many countries have reduced or eliminated their use of coal power. 　The United Nations Secretary General asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020. 　Global coal use peaked in 2013. 　To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming below 2 °C (3.6 °F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030, and phasing out coal was agreed upon in the Glasgow Climate Pact. 　The largest consumer and importer of coal in 2020 was China, which accounts for almost half the world's annual coal production, followed by India with about a tenth. 　Indonesia and Australia export the most, followed by Russia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester>Manchester</a> 
<font size=3>
Manchester (/ˈmæntʃɪstər, -tʃɛs-/) is a city in Greater Manchester, England. 　It had a population of 552,000 in 2021. 　It is bordered by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east, and the neighbouring city of Salford to the west. 　The two cities and the surrounding towns form one of the United Kingdom's most populous conurbations, the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, which has a population of 2.87 million. 　The history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort (castra) of Mamucium or Mancunium, established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. 　Historically part of Lancashire, areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated into Manchester in the 20th century, including Wythenshawe in 1931. 　Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township, but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century. 　Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. 　Manchester achieved city status in 1853. 　The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to the Irish Sea, 36 miles (58 km) to the west. 　Its fortune declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, and the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration. 　Following considerable redevelopment, Manchester was the host city for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. 　The city is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. 　Manchester Liverpool Road railway station was the world's first inter-city passenger railway station. 　At the University of Manchester, Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917, Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world's first stored-program computer in 1948, and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the first graphene in 2004.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi>Pi</a> 
<font size=3>
The number π (/paɪ/; spelled out as "pi") is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. 　The number π appears in many formulas across mathematics and physics. 　It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as 22 7 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {22}{7}}} are commonly used to approximate it. 　Consequently, its decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. 　It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be a solution of an equation involving only sums, products, powers, and integers. 　The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. 　The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed, but no proof of this conjecture has been found. 　For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of π, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. 　Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations. 　Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy. 　In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematicians approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematicians made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. 　The first computational formula for π, based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later. 　The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706. 　The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of π, enough for all practical scientific computations. 　Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of π to many trillions of digits. 　These computations are motivated by the development of efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the human quest to break records. 　The extensive computations involved have also been used to test supercomputers. 　Because its definition relates to the circle, π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses and spheres. 　It is also found in formulae from other topics in science, such as cosmology, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism. 　In modern mathematical analysis, it is often instead defined without any reference to geometry; therefore, it also appears in areas having little to do with geometry, such as number theory and statistics. 　The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants inside and outside of science. 　Several books devoted to π have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering>Scattering</a> 
<font size=3>
Scattering is a term used in physics to describe a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form, such as light or sound, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by localized non-uniformities (including particles and radiation) in the medium through which they pass. 　In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. 　Reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections. 　Originally, the term was confined to light scattering (going back at least as far as Isaac Newton in the 17th century). 　As more "ray"-like phenomena were discovered, the idea of scattering was extended to them, so that William Herschel could refer to the scattering of "heat rays" (not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature) in 1800. 　John Tyndall, a pioneer in light scattering research, noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s. 　Near the end of the 19th century, the scattering of cathode rays (electron beams) and X-rays was observed and discussed. 　With the discovery of subatomic particles (e.g. Ernest Rutherford in 1911) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century, the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena. 　Scattering can refer to the consequences of particle-particle collisions between molecules, atoms, electrons, photons and other particles. 　Examples include: cosmic ray scattering in the Earth's upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside particle accelerators; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors. 　The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as scatterers or scattering centers, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes particles, bubbles, droplets, density fluctuations in fluids, crystallites in polycrystalline solids, defects in monocrystalline solids, surface roughness, cells in organisms, and textile fibers in clothing. 　The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory. 　Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, medical ultrasound, semiconductor wafer inspection, polymerization process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and computer-generated imagery. 　Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. 　In Particle Physics the quantum interaction and scattering of fundamental particles is described by the Scattering Matrix or S-Matrix, introduced and developed by John Archibald Wheeler and Werner Heisenberg. 　Scattering is quantified using many different concepts, including scattering cross section (σ), attenuation coefficients, the bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF), S-matrices, and mean free path.

In Newtonian mechanics, momentum (more specifically linear momentum or translational momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. 　It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. 　If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum p is : p = m v . 　{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} .　} In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg⋅m/s), which is equivalent to the newton-second. 　Newton's second law of motion states that the rate of change of a body's momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. 　Momentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. 　Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form, in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity. 　It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry. 　Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. 　In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. 　The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave function. 　The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 　In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier–Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids.

<font size=3>
Philip, also Phillip, is a male given name, derived from the Greek Φίλιππος (Philippos, lit. "horse-loving" or "fond of horses"), from a compound of φίλος (philos, "dear", "loved", "loving") and ἵππος (hippos, "horse"). 　Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedonia and one of the apostles of early Christianity. 　Philip has many alternative spellings. 　One derivation often used as a surname is Phillips. 　It was also found during ancient Greek times with two Ps as Philippides and Philippos. 　It has many diminutive (or even hypocoristic) forms including Phil, Philly, Lip, Pip, Pep or Peps. 　There are also feminine forms such as Philippine and Philippa.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(psychology)>Construct (psychology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Construct (psychology), also hypothetical construct or psychological construct, is a tool used to facilitate understanding of human behavior. 　A psychological construct is a label for a domain of behaviors. 　Behavioral sciences use constructs such as conscientiousness, intelligence, political power, self-esteem, and group culture. 　For example, if a student sees another sitting in a classroom before an examination biting her nails and fidgeting, the interpretation might be that she is experiencing anxiety. 　In that case, anxiety is a construct that underlies the behavior that is observed. 　Cognitive psychologists view constructs as hypothesized causes for certain behaviors, whereas behavioral psychologists view constructs as only descriptors of behaviors. 　A construct derives its name from the fact that it is a mental construction, derived from scientific process: observing natural phenomena, inferring the common features of those observations, and constructing a label for the commonality or the underlying cause. 　A construct derives its scientific value from the shared meaning it represents for different people. 　If a construct is clearly articulated and the phenomena it encompasses are clearly defined, it becomes a useful conceptual tool that facilitates communication. 　Once defined, constructs become objects of conceptual scrutiny in their own right. 　Constructs summarize behavioral domains. 　Constructs are the building blocks of scientific theories.

<font size=3>
Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. 　It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss. 　An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier, or underwriter. 　A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. 　The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. 　The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. 　Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship. 　The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured, or their designated beneficiary or assignee. 　The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. 　If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. 　A mandatory out-of-pocket expense required by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called a deductible (or if required by a health insurance policy, a copayment). 　The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.

<font size=3>
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. 　It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. 　Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. 　Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. 　About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. 　The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. 　Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 　Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 　Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. 　As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. 　It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. 　It also secretes and perceives pheromones. 　Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. 　Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. 　Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species. 　It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC. 　As of 2021,[update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. 　As of 2017,[update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. 　In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[update]
