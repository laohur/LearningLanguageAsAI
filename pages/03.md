## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province>Province</a> 

<font size=3>
A province is almost always an administrative division within a country or state. 　The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia, which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. 　The term province has since been adopted by many countries. 　In some countries with no actual provinces, "the provinces" is a metaphorical term meaning "outside the capital city". 　While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. 　Many have their own powers independent of central or federal authority, especially in Canada and Pakistan. 　In other countries, like China or France, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence>Evidence</a> 

<font size=3>
Evidence for a proposition is what supports this proposition. 　It is usually understood as an indication that the supported proposition is true. 　What role evidence plays and how it is conceived varies from field to field. 　In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what makes it rational to hold a certain doxastic attitude. 　For example, a perceptual experience of a tree may act as evidence that justifies the belief that there is a tree. 　In this role, evidence is usually understood as a private mental state. 　Important topics in this field include the questions of what the nature of these mental states is, for example, whether they have to be propositional, and whether misleading mental states can still qualify as evidence. 　In phenomenology, evidence is understood in a similar sense. 　Here, however, it is limited to intuitive knowledge that provides immediate access to truth and is therefore indubitable. 　In this role, it is supposed to provide ultimate justifications for basic philosophical principles and thus turn philosophy into a rigorous science. 　However, it is highly controversial whether evidence can meet these requirements. 　Other fields, including the sciences and the law, tend to emphasize more the public nature of evidence (for example, scientists tend to focus on how the data used during statistical inference are generated). 　In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which confirms or disconfirms scientific hypotheses. 　Measurements of Mercury's "anomalous" orbit, for example, are seen as evidence that confirms Einstein's theory of general relativity. 　In order to play the role of neutral arbiter between competing theories, it is important that scientific evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events, so that the proponents of the different theories can agree on what the evidence is. 　This is ensured by following the scientific method and tends to lead to an emerging scientific consensus through the gradual accumulation of evidence. 　Two issues for the scientific conception of evidence are the problem of underdetermination, i.e. that the available evidence may support competing theories equally well, and theory-ladenness, i.e. that what some scientists consider the evidence to be may already involve various theoretical assumptions not shared by other scientists. 　It is often held that there are two kinds of evidence: intellectual evidence or what is self-evident and empirical evidence or evidence accessible through the senses. 　In order for something to act as evidence for a hypothesis, it has to stand in the right relation to it. 　In philosophy, this is referred to as the "evidential relation" and there are competing theories about what this relation has to be like. 　Probabilistic approaches hold that something counts as evidence if it increases the probability of the supported hypothesis. 　According to hypothetico-deductivism, evidence consists in observational consequences of the hypothesis. 　The positive-instance approach states that an observation sentence is evidence for a universal hypothesis if the sentence describes a positive instance of this hypothesis. 　The evidential relation can occur in various degrees of strength. 　These degrees range from direct proof of the truth of a hypothesis to weak evidence that is merely consistent with the hypothesis but does not rule out other, competing hypotheses, as in circumstantial evidence. 　In law, rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. 　Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. 　The parts of a legal case that are not in controversy are known, in general, as the "facts of the case." 　Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. 　Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. 　Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.

<font size=3>
A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. 　Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. 　Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization and science. 　After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth. 　Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce. 　The word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged. 　As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons. 　Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. 　The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE

Kept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man. 　The show premiered on the American cable network VH1 in late May 2005. 　When Hall narrowed the list down to twelve, she spirited them off to London and eliminated them one by one. 　The final three consisted of Anwar, Austen and Seth. 　In the August 4 finale, Hall was torn between Austen and Seth but ultimately chose Seth as he knew how to have fun and she thought he had matured throughout the process. 　Seth claims that he got his $100,000 in prize money but after filming stopped he never saw Jerry, the penthouse apartment, or the Lamborghini again.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management>Management</a> 

<font size=3>
Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a nonprofit organization, or a government body. 　It is the art and science of managing resources of the business. 　Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. 　"Run the business" and "Change the business" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend. 　The term "management" may also refer to those people who manage an organization—managers. 　Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management includes the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.), Master of Business Administration (MBA.), Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree. 　Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. 　In the past few decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management. 　Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure: Senior managers such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization sets the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. 　Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management, and directly or indirectly report to them. 　Middle managers such as branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to the front-line managers. 　They communicate the strategic goals and policy of senior management to the front-line managers. 　Line managers such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work. 　Line managers often perform the managerial functions that are traditionally considered as the core of management. 　Despite the name, they are usually considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization's management class. 　In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization. 　Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership.

<font size=3>
In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. 　The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or "lower" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand. 　By anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, is considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. 　The Latin term brachium, which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper limb as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.

An episode is a narrative unit within a larger dramatic work or documentary production, such as a series intended for radio, television or streaming consumption. 　The noun episode is derived from the Greek term epeisodion (Ancient Greek: ἐπεισόδιον), meaning the material contained between two songs or odes in a Greek tragedy. 　It is abbreviated as ep (plural eps). 　An episode is also a narrative unit within a continuous larger dramatic work. 　It is frequently used to describe units of television or radio series that are broadcast separately in order to form one longer series. 　An episode is to a sequence as a chapter is to a book. 　Modern series episodes typically last 20 to 50 minutes in length. 　The noun episode can also refer to a part of a subject, such as an "episode of life" or an "episode of drama".

Attention in psychology is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of other stimuli. 　A process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective. 　William James (1890) wrote that "Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence." 　Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. 　Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness. 　Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. 　Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes, which may include working memory and psychological vigilance. 　A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury and its effects on attention. 　Attention also varies across cultures. 　The relationships between attention and consciousness are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration. 　Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from mental health and the study of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and its domains of research.

<font size=3>
A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. 　A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. 　A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases. 　A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. 　In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources. 　Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. 　The library's clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library, for example. 　Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. 　Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet. 　The services that libraries offer are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.

<font size=3>
In molecular biology, a library is a collection of DNA fragments that is stored and propagated in a population of micro-organisms through the process of molecular cloning. 　There are different types of DNA libraries, including cDNA libraries (formed from reverse-transcribed RNA), genomic libraries (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated). 　DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, genetic engineering, and protein engineering, and the applications of these libraries depend on the source of the original DNA fragments. 　There are differences in the cloning vectors and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of bacteria (a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert). 　As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, "cloned").

<font size=3>
Length is a measure of distance. 　In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. 　In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. 　In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre. 　Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. 　However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in. 　Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. 　Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. 　Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. 　Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object. 　Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason>Reason</a> 

<font size=3>
Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. 　It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. 　Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality. 　Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. 　The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. 　Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. 　Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. 　In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. 　For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks. 　Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. 　For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. 　Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination. 　In contrast to the use of "reason" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. 　Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals. 　Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. 　For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does." 　Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. 　The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. 　Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic>Republic</a> 

<font size=3>
A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a "state in which power rests with the people or their representatives; specifically a state without a monarchy" and also a "government, or system of government, of such a state." 　Previously, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term was used to imply a state with a democratic or representative constitution (constitutional republic), but more recently it has also been used of autocratic or dictatorial states not ruled by a monarch. 　It is now chiefly used to denote any non-monarchical state headed by an elected or appointed president. 　As of 2017[update], 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official names. 　Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word "republic" used in the names of all states with elected governments. 　The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means "public thing", "public matter", or "public affair" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. 　The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BCE. 　This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority. 　Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. 　For instance, the United States Constitution "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government". 　Another example was the Soviet Union, described by its authoritarian and extremely centralised government as being a federation of voluntarily united "Soviet socialist republics" with equal rights and an ostensibly high degree of internal autonomy. 　The Russian Federation is similarly a state that is composed partly of several "republics".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing>Writing</a> 

<font size=3>
Writing is a neuropsychological activity involving cognitive and physical processes and the use of writing systems to structure and translate human thoughts into persistent representations of human language. 　A system of writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the language it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols representing that language's phonology and morphology. 　Nevertheless, written language may take on characteristics distinctive from any available in spoken language. 　The outcome of this activity, also called "writing", and sometimes a "text", is a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented linguistic symbols. 　The interpreter or activator of a text is called a "reader". 　Writing systems do not themselves constitute languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages); they are a means of rendering language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space. 　While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries or other public records). 　Writing can also have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise.

<font size=3>
A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath. 　It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. 　There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. 　Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it. 　The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones. 　The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. 　The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition>Competition</a> 

<font size=3>
Competition is a rivalry where two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game). 　Competition can arise between entities such as organisms, individuals, economic and social groups, etc. 　The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition: Competition occurs in nature, between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. 　Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. 　Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment. 　Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. 　Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop. 　Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. 　In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued "the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system. The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players". 　Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory. 　Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. 　Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition. 　They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. 　They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. 　Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. 　Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. 　They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

<font size=3>
Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both require a resource that is in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). 　Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved since the presence of one of the organisms always reduces the amount of the resource available to the other. 　In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species is an important biological interaction. 　Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure, species diversity, and population dynamics (shifts in a population over time). 　There are three major mechanisms of competition: interference, exploitation, and apparent competition (in order from most direct to least direct). 　Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, but instead share a predator. 　Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. 　According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources must either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. 　According to evolutionary theory, competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. 　More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven not by competition between organisms, but by these animals adapting to colonize empty livable space; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.

<font size=3>
Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国, Nihonkoku) is an island country in East Asia. 　It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. 　Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. 　Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto. 　Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. 　About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of almost 125 million on narrow coastal plains. 　Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. 　The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.2 million residents. 　Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle (the Book of Han) finished in the 2nd century AD. 　Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. 　Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō) and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). 　After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. 　In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. 　In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. 　Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. 　After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution and began a military alliance with the United States. 　Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. 　Japan is a developed country and a great power. 　It is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, G20, OECD, and the Group of Seven. 　Its economy is the world's third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP, with its per capita income ranking at 36th highest in the world. 　Although Japan has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. 　After World War II, Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1972 but has stagnated since 1995 in what is referred to as the Lost Decades. 　Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a population decline. 　A global leader in the automotive, robotics and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology. 　The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent manga, anime and video game industries.

<font size=3>
Distribution in pharmacology is a branch of pharmacokinetics which describes the reversible transfer of a drug from one location to another within the body. 　Once a drug enters into systemic circulation by absorption or direct administration, it must be distributed into interstitial and intracellular fluids. 　Each organ or tissue can receive different doses of the drug and the drug can remain in the different organs or tissues for a varying amount of time. 　The distribution of a drug between tissues is dependent on vascular permeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output and perfusion rate of the tissue and the ability of the drug to bind tissue and plasma proteins and its lipid solubility. 　pH partition plays a major role as well. 　The drug is easily distributed in highly perfused organs such as the liver, heart and kidney. 　It is distributed in small quantities through less perfused tissues like muscle, fat and peripheral organs. 　The drug can be moved from the plasma to the tissue until the equilibrium is established (for unbound drug present in plasma). 　The concept of compartmentalization of an organism must be considered when discussing a drug’s distribution. 　This concept is used in pharmacokinetic modelling.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential>Potential</a> 

<font size=3>
Potential generally refers to a currently unrealized ability. 　The term is used in a wide variety of fields, from physics to the social sciences to indicate things that are in a state where they are able to change in ways ranging from the simple release of energy by objects to the realization of abilities in people. 　The philosopher Aristotle incorporated this concept into his theory of potentiality and actuality, a pair of closely connected principles which he used to analyze motion, causality, ethics, and physiology in his Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, and De Anima, which is about the human psyche. 　That which is potential can theoretically be made actual by taking the right action; for example, a boulder on the edge of a cliff has potential to fall that could be actualized by pushing it over the edge. 　Several languages have a potential mood, a grammatical construction that indicates that something is potential. 　These include Finnish, Japanese, and Sanskrit. 　In physics, a potential may refer to the scalar potential or to the vector potential. 　In either case, it is a field defined in space, from which many important physical properties may be derived. 　Leading examples are the gravitational potential and the electric potential, from which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be obtained. 　Specific forces have associated potentials, including the Coulomb potential, the van der Waals potential, the Lennard-Jones potential and the Yukawa potential. 　In electrochemistry there are Galvani potential, Volta potential, electrode potential, and standard electrode potential. 　In the thermodynamics, the term potential often refers to thermodynamic potential.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade>Trade</a> 

<font size=3>
Trade involves the transfer of goods and services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. 　Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market. 　An early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, i.e. trading things without the use of money. 　Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. 　As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. 　The invention of money (and letter of credit, paper money, and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. 　Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. 　In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labour, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. 　Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity—including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. 　For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. 　In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations. 　Different types of traders may specialize in trading different kinds of goods; for example, the spice trade and grain trade have both historically been important in the development of a global, international economy. 　Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. 　Wholesale trade is traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services. 　Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. 　Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. 　Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). 　Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(archaeology)>Cut (archaeology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In archaeology and archaeological stratification, a cut or truncation is a context that represents a moment in time when other archaeological deposits were removed for the creation of some feature, such as a ditch or pit. 　In layman's terms, a cut can be thought of as a hole that was dug in the past, though cut also applies to other parts of the archaeological record such as horizontal truncations like terraced ground. 　A cut context is sometimes referred to as a "negative context", as opposed to a "positive context". 　The term denotes that a cut has removed material from the archaeological record or natural[clarification needed] at the time of its creation, as opposed to a positive context, which adds material to the archaeological record. 　A cut has zero thickness and no material properties of its own and is defined by the limits of other contexts. 　Cuts are seen in the record by virtue of the difference between the material it was cut through and the material that back-fills it. 　This difference is seen as an "edge" by the archaeologists on site. 　This is shown in the picture (Fig. 1), where a half sectioned Saxon pit has had half its backfill removed and we can clearly see a difference between the ground the pit was cut into, and the material originally filling the pit. 　Sometimes these differences are not clear and an archaeologist must rely on experience and insight to discover cuts.

A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. 　Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. 　Among humans, a smile expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. 　It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a grimace. 　Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world, there are large differences among different cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense>Sense</a> 

<font size=3>
A sense is a biological system used by an organism for sensation, the process of gathering information about the world through the detection of stimuli. 　(For example, in the human body, the brain which is part of the central nervous system receives signals from the senses which continuously receive information from the environment, interprets these signals, and causes the body to respond, either chemically or physically.) 　Although traditionally five human senses were identified as such (namely sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing), it is now recognized that there are many more. 　Senses used by non-human organisms are even greater in variety and number. 　During sensation, sense organs collect various stimuli (such as a sound or smell) for transduction, meaning transformation into a form that can be understood by the brain. 　Sensation and perception are fundamental to nearly every aspect of an organism's cognition, behavior and thought. 　In organisms, a sensory organ consists of a group of interrelated sensory cells that respond to a specific type of physical stimulus. 　Via cranial and spinal nerves (nerves of the Central and Peripheral nervous systems that relay sensory information to and from the brain and body), the different types of sensory receptor cells (such as mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors) in sensory organs transduct sensory information from these organs towards the central nervous system, finally arriving at the sensory cortices in the brain, where sensory signals are processed and interpreted (perceived). 　Sensory systems, or senses, are often divided into external (exteroception) and internal (interoception) sensory systems. 　Human external senses are based on the sensory organs of the eyes, ears, skin, nose, and mouth. 　Internal sensation detects stimuli from internal organs and tissues. 　Internal senses possessed by humans include the vestibular system (sense of balance) sensed by the inner ear, as well as others such as spatial orientation, proprioception (body position) and nociception (pain). 　Further internal senses lead to signals such as hunger, thirst, suffocation, and nausea, or different involuntary behaviors, such as vomiting. 　Some animals are able to detect electrical and magnetic fields, air moisture, or polarized light, while others sense and perceive through alternative systems, such as echolocation. 　Sensory modalities or sub modalities are different ways sensory information is encoded or transduced. 　Multimodality integrates different senses into one unified perceptual experience. 　For example, information from one sense has the potential to influence how information from another is perceived. 　Sensation and perception are studied by a variety of related fields, most notably psychophysics, neurobiology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive science.

In molecular biology and genetics, the sense of a nucleic acid molecule, particularly of a strand of DNA or RNA, refers to the nature of the roles of the strand and its complement in specifying a sequence of amino acids.　[citation needed] Depending on the context, sense may have slightly different meanings. 　For example, negative-sense strand of DNA is equivalent to the template strand, whereas the positive-sense strand is the non-template strand whose nucleotide sequence is equivalent to the sequence of the mRNA transcript.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast>Coast</a> 

<font size=3>
The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the coastline. 　The Earth has around 620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline. 　Coasts are important zones in natural ecosystems, often home to a wide range of biodiversity. 　On land, they harbor important ecosystems such as freshwater or estuarine wetlands, which are important for bird populations and other terrestrial animals. 　In wave-protected areas they harbor saltmarshes, mangroves or seagrasses, all of which can provide nursery habitat for finfish, shellfish, and other aquatic species. 　Rocky shores are usually found along exposed coasts and provide habitat for a wide range of sessile animals (e.g. mussels, starfish, barnacles) and various kinds of seaweeds. 　Along tropical coasts with clear, nutrient-poor water, coral reefs can often be found between depths of 1–50 meters (3.3–164.0 feet). 　According to a United Nations atlas, 44% of all people live within 5 km (3.3mi) of the sea. 　Because of their importance in society and high concentration of population, the coast is important for major parts of the global food and economic system, and they provide many ecosystem services to humankind. 　For example, important human activities happen in port cities. 　Coastal fisheries (commercial, recreational, and subsistence) and aquaculture are major economic activities and create jobs, livelihoods, and protein for the majority of coastal human populations. 　Other coastal spaces like beaches and seaside resorts generate large revenues through tourism. 　Marine coastal ecosystems can also provide protection against sea level rise and tsunamis. 　In many countries, mangroves are the primary source of wood for fuel (e.g. charcoal) and building material. 　Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses have a much higher capacity for carbon sequestration than many terrestrial ecosystems, and as such can play a critical role in the near-future to help mitigate climate change effects by uptake of atmospheric anthropogenic carbon dioxide. 　However, the economic importance of coasts makes many of these communities vulnerable to climate change, which causes increases in extreme weather and sea level rise, and related issues such as coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding. 　Other coastal issues, such as marine pollution, marine debris, coastal development, and marine ecosystem destruction, further complicate the human uses of the coast and threaten coastal ecosystems. 　The interactive effects of climate change, habitat destruction, overfishing and water pollution (especially eutrophication) have led to the demise of coastal ecosystem around the globe. 　This has resulted in population collapse of fisheries stocks, loss of biodiversity, increased invasion of alien species, and loss of healthy habitats. 　International attention to these issues has been captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 "Life Below Water" which sets goals for international policy focused on preserving marine coastal ecosystems and supporting more sustainable economic practices for coastal communities. 　Likewise, the United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, but restoration of coastal ecosystems has received insufficient attention. 　Because coasts are constantly changing, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined; this measurement challenge is called the coastline paradox. 　The term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur. 　Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East, West, and Gulf Coast of the United States.) Coasts with a narrow continental shelf that are close to the open ocean are called pelagic coast, while other coasts are more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. 　A shore, on the other hand, may refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and lakes (lake shore).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir>Sir</a> 

<font size=3>
Sir is a formal honorific address in English for men, derived from Sire in the High Middle Ages. 　Both are derived from the old French "Sieur" (Lord), brought to England by the French-speaking Normans, and which now exist in French only as part of "Monsieur", with the equivalent "My Lord" in English. 　Traditionally, as governed by law and custom, Sir is used for men titled as knights, often as members of orders of chivalry, as well as later applied to baronets and other offices. 　As the female equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the suo jure female equivalent term is typically Dame. 　The wife of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed as Lady, although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist. 　Additionally, since the late modern period, Sir has been used as a respectful way to address a man of superior social status or military rank. 　Equivalent terms of address for women are Madam (shortened to Ma'am), in addition to social honorifics such as Mrs, Ms or Miss.

<font size=3>
An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. 　It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. 　Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons. 　The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. 　The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. 　Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. 　Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others.

<font size=3>
A valley is an elongated low area often running between hills or mountains, which will typically contain a river or stream running from one end to the other. 　Most valleys are formed by erosion of the land surface by rivers or streams over a very long period. 　Some valleys are formed through erosion by glacial ice. 　These glaciers may remain present in valleys in high mountains or polar areas. 　At lower latitudes and altitudes, these glacially formed valleys may have been created or enlarged during ice ages but now are ice-free and occupied by streams or rivers. 　In desert areas, valleys may be entirely dry or carry a watercourse only rarely. 　In areas of limestone bedrock, dry valleys may also result from drainage now taking place underground rather than at the surface. 　Rift valleys arise principally from earth movements, rather than erosion. 　Many different types of valleys are described by geographers, using terms that may be global in use or else applied only locally.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance>Distance</a> 

<font size=3>
Distance is a numerical or occasionally qualitative measurement of how far apart objects or points are. 　In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. "two counties over"). 　Since spatial cognition is a rich source of conceptual metaphors in human thought, the term is also frequently used metaphorically to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as statistical distance between probability distributions or edit distance between strings of text) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by distance between people in a social network). 　Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in mathematics using the notion of a metric space. 　In the social sciences, distance can refer to a qualitative measurement of separation, such as social distance or psychological distance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(archaeology)>Industry (archaeology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Not to be confused with industrial archaeology, the archaeology of (modern) industrial sites. 　In the archaeology of the Stone Age, an industry or technocomplex is a typological classification of stone tools. 　An industry consists of a number of lithic assemblages, typically including a range of different types of tools, that are grouped together on the basis of shared technological or morphological characteristics. 　For example, the Acheulean industry includes hand-axes, cleavers, scrapers and other tools with different forms, but which were all manufactured by the symmetrical reduction of a bifacial core producing large flakes. 　Industries are usually named after a type site where these characteristics were first observed (e.g. the Mousterian industry is named after the site of Le Moustier). 　By contrast, Neolithic axeheads from the Langdale axe industry were recognised as a type well before the centre at Great Langdale was identified by finds of debitage and other remains of the production, and confirmed by petrography (geological analysis). 　The stone was quarried and rough axe heads were produced there, to be more finely worked and polished elsewhere. 　As a taxonomic classification of artefacts, industries rank higher than archaeological cultures. 　Cultures are usually defined from a range of different artefact types and are thought to be related to a distinct cultural tradition. 　By contrast, industries are defined by basic elements of lithic production which may have been used by many unrelated human groups over tens or even hundred thousands of years, and over very wide geographical ranges. 　Sites producing tools from the Acheulean industry stretch from France to China, as well as Africa. 　Consequently, shifts between lithic industries are thought to reflect major milestones in human evolution, such as changes in cognitive ability or even the replacement of one human species by another. 　However, findings from ancient DNA studies describe several changes and periods of stasis in European populations that are not strongly reflected in the current cultural taxonomic frameworks. 　Therefore, artefacts from a single industry may come from a number of different cultures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_(Scientology)>Clear (Scientology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In Dianetics and Scientology, Clear is a status afforded to followers by the Scientology organization, or by other Scientologists, after they complete certain activities. 　It is one of the major ostensible "states" practitioners strive to reach on their way up what the Scientologists call the Bridge to Total Freedom. 　Scientology followers are given the status of Clear when a person is deemed to be free of the influence of engrams – supposed unwanted emotions or painful traumas which Scientology claims are not readily available to the conscious mind. 　Scientologists believe that human beings accumulate anxieties, psychosomatic illnesses, and aberration due to receiving engrams throughout their current or past lives, and that by applying Dianetics, every single person can obtain the status of Clear. 　A Clear is defined by the Church of Scientology as a person who no longer has a "reactive mind" (a pseudoscientific subdivision of the mind), and is therefore free from negative effects purported to be produced by the "reactive mind". 　A Clear is said to be "at cause over" (that is, in control of) their "mental energy" (their thoughts), and able to think clearly even when faced with the very situations that in earlier times caused them difficulty. 　The next level of spiritual development is that of an Operating Thetan. 　A person who has not reached a state of Clear is called a "pre-clear." 　Dianetics claims that a person's awareness is influenced by the stimulus-response nature of the "reactive mind". 　Achieving the state of Clear means a person has supposedly overcome the "reactive mind" and is in complete control of their analytical mind. 　According to Hubbard: "A Clear is a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause. The Clear has no engrams which, when restimulated, throw out the correctness of his computations by entering hidden and false data." 　Sociologist Roy Wallis noted, “Being Clear meant being able to do all those things which one could currently not do, and to which one aspired so desperately.” 　It is estimated that the cost of reaching the Clear state in Scientology is $128,000.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint>Saint</a> 

<font size=3>
In religious belief, a saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God. 　However, the use of the term saint depends on the context and denomination. 　In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation. 　Official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently a public cult of veneration, is conferred on some denominational saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church after their approval. 　While the English word saint originated in Christianity, historians of religion tend to use the appellation "in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people", referring to the Jewish tzadik, the Islamic walī, the Hindu rishi or Sikh Bhagat and guru, the Shintoist kami, the Taoist shengren, and the Buddhist arhat or bodhisattva also as saints. 　Depending on the religion, saints are recognized either by official ecclesiastical declaration, as in the Catholic faith, or by popular acclamation (see folk saint).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament>Tournament</a> 

<font size=3>
A tournament is a competition involving at least three competitors, all participating in a sport or game. 　More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses: One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a relatively short time interval. 　A competition involving a number of matches, each involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. 　These are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most team sports, racket sports and combat sports, many card games and board games, and many forms of competitive debating. 　Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match. 　These two senses are distinct. 　All golf tournaments meet the first definition, but while match play tournaments meet the second, stroke play tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. 　In contrast, association football leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many venues over a period of up to a season. 　Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship. 　Tournaments "are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members". 　A tournament-match (or tie or fixture or heat) may involve multiple game-matches (or rubbers or legs) between the competitors. 　For example, in the Davis Cup tennis tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. 　The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. 　In the later rounds of UEFA Champions League, each fixture is played over two legs. 　The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with a penalty shoot-out used if the scores are level after both matches conclude.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa>Africa</a> 

<font size=3>
Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. 　At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. 　With 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. 　Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. 　Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, behind Oceania. 　Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, tribalism, colonialism, the Cold War, neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption. 　Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context. 　The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 　The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. 　It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. 　Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. 　African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa. 　Africa straddles the equator and the prime meridian. 　It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones. 　The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. 　Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, and the entire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla, and Tunisia which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. 　In the other extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, great parts of South Africa, the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone. 　Africa is highly biodiverse; it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. 　However, Africa also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity and pollution. 　These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa. 　The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change. 　The history of Africa is long, complex, and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community. 　Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes). 　The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) remains, found in Ethiopia, South Africa, and Morocco, date to circa 233,000, 259,000, and 300,000 years ago respectively, and Homo sapiens is believed to have originated in Africa around 350,000–260,000 years ago. 　Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited. 　Early human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and Carthage emerged in North Africa. 　Following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. 　The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing European influence on the continent. 　Starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which created large African diaspora populations in the Americas. 　From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, European nations colonized almost all of Africa, reaching a point when only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent polities. 　Most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II.

<font size=3>
Standing, also referred to as orthostasis, is a position in which the body is held in an erect ("orthostatic") position and supported only by the feet. 　Although seemingly static, the body rocks slightly back and forth from the ankle in the sagittal plane. 　The sagittal plane bisects the body into right and left sides. 　The sway of quiet standing is often likened to the motion of an inverted pendulum. 　Standing at attention is a military standing posture, as is stand at ease, but these terms are also used in military-style organisations and in some professions which involve standing, such as modeling. 　At ease refers to the classic military position of standing with legs slightly apart, not in as formal or regimented a pose as standing at attention. 　In modeling, model at ease refers to the model standing with one leg straight, with the majority of the weight on it, and the other leg tucked over and slightly around.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy>Policy</a> 

<font size=3>
Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. 　A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. 　Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization. 　Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making. 　Policies used in subjective decision-making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result, are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work–life balance policy... 　Moreover, Governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentives and voluntary practices. 　Frequently, resource allocations mirror policy decisions. 　Policy is a blueprint of the organizational activities which are repetitive/routine in nature. 　In contrast, policies to assist in objective decision-making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy. 　The term may apply to government, public sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals, Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy. 　Policy differs from rules or law. 　While the law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve the desired outcome. 　Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. 　Policies can be understood as political, managerial, financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. 　In public corporate finance, a critical accounting policy is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the financial statements.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female>Female</a> 

<font size=3>
An organism's sex is female (symbol: ♀) if it produces the large non-motile ovum (egg cell), the type of gamete (sex cell) that fuses with the male gamete (sperm cell) during sexual reproduction. 　A female has larger gametes than a male. 　Females and males are results of the anisogamous reproduction system, wherein gametes are of different sizes (unlike isogamy where they are the same size). 　The exact mechanism of female gamete evolution remains unknown. 　In species that have males and females, sex-determination may be based on either sex chromosomes, or environmental conditions. 　Most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes. 　Female characteristics vary between different species, with some species having pronounced secondary female sex characteristics, such as the presence of pronounced mammary glands in mammals. 　In humans, the word female can also be used to refer to gender in the social sense of gender role or gender identity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success>Success</a> 

<font size=3>
Success is the state or condition of meeting a defined range of expectations. 　It may be viewed as the opposite of failure. 　The criteria for success depend on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. 　One person might consider a success what another person considers a failure, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. 　Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a success, another might consider to be a failure, a qualified success or a neutral situation. 　For example, a film that is a commercial failure or even a box-office bomb can go on to receive a cult following, with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness. 　It may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for success or failure due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. 　Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the failure or success of a situation may itself be a significant task.

An image is a visual representation of something. 　It can be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or somehow otherwise feed into the visual system to convey information. 　An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject. 　In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s). 　In optics, the term "image" may refer specifically to a 2D image. 　An image does not have to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. 　A popular example of this is of a greyscale image, which uses the visual system's sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths, without taking into account different colors. 　A black and white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not make full use of the visual system's capabilities. 　Images are typically still, but in some cases can be moving or animated.

A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or another bay. 　A large bay is usually called a gulf, sea, sound, or bight. 　A cove is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance. 　A fjord is an elongated bay formed by glacial action. 　A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary of the Susquehanna River. 　Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada. 　Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology.　[citation needed] The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves. 　Bays may have as wide a variety of shoreline characteristics as other shorelines. 　In some cases, bays have beaches, which "are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace". 　Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for fishing. 　Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit>Bit</a> 

<font size=3>
The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. 　The name is a portmanteau of binary digit. 　The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. 　These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, on/off, or +/− are also commonly used. 　The relation between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program. 　It may be physically implemented with a two-state device. 　A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a single-dimensional (or multi-dimensional) bit array. 　A group of eight bits is called one byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined. 　Frequently, half, full, double and quadruple words consist of a number of bytes which is a low power of two. 　A string of four bits is a nibble. 　In information theory, one bit is the information entropy of a random binary variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known. 　As a unit of information, the bit is also known as a shannon, named after Claude E. Shannon. 　The symbol for the binary digit is either "bit" as per the IEC 80000-13:2008 standard, or the lowercase character "b", as per the IEEE 1541-2002 standard. 　Use of the latter may create confusion with the capital "B" which is used for the byte.

<font size=3>
Forced is a single-player and co-op action role-playing game developed by BetaDwarf, released in October 2013 for Windows, OS X and Linux through the Steam platform as well as Wii U. It is about gladiators fighting for their freedom in a fantasy arena where they are assisted by a spirit-like character called Balfus. 　Gameplay consists of selecting a weapon class and abilities to combat the various enemies of each arena, while solving puzzles using the help of Balfus. 　BetaDwarf was formed by a small group of students in 2011, who began developing the game in an unused classroom in Aalborg University – Copenhagen, Denmark. 　They were removed months later and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign involving an Imgur picture which documented their progress. 　Forced received moderate to favorable reviews with most critics praising its competitive gameplay and puzzle-system. 　The game's weak plot, technical glitches and excess difficulty were the negative highlights. 　It won the Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year (2013) for it.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)>Opening (morphology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematical morphology, opening is the dilation of the erosion of a set A by a structuring element B: A ∘ B = ( A ⊖ B ) ⊕ B , {\displaystyle A\circ B=(A\ominus B)\oplus B,\,} where ⊖ {\displaystyle \ominus } and ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } denote erosion and dilation, respectively. 　Together with closing, the opening serves in computer vision and image processing as a basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. 　Opening removes small objects from the foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels) of an image, placing them in the background, while closing removes small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background into foreground. 　These techniques can also be used to find specific shapes in an image. 　Opening can be used to find things into which a specific structuring element can fit (edges, corners, ...). 　One can think of B sweeping around the inside of the boundary of A, so that it does not extend beyond the boundary, and shaping the A boundary around the boundary of the element.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge>Knowledge</a> 

<font size=3>
Knowledge is often understood as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations. 　Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. 　While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification: whether it is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. 　These controversies intensified due to a series of thought experiments by Edmund Gettier and have provoked various alternative definitions. 　Some of them deny that justification is necessary and replace it, for example, with reliability or the manifestation of cognitive virtues. 　Others contend that justification is needed but formulate additional requirements, for example, that no defeaters of the belief are present or that the person would not have the belief if it was false. 　Knowledge can be produced in many different ways. 　The most important source of empirical knowledge is perception, which refers to the usage of the senses. 　Many theorists also include introspection as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of one's own mental states. 　Other sources often discussed include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. 　According to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in the sense that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental states. 　This claim is rejected by coherentists, who contend that a sufficient degree of coherence among all the mental states of the believer is necessary for knowledge. 　Many different aspects of knowledge are investigated and it plays a role in various disciplines. 　It is the primary subject of the field of epistemology, which studies what we know, how we come to know it, and what it means to know something. 　The problem of the value of knowledge concerns the question of why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. 　Philosophical skepticism is the controversial thesis that we lack any form of knowledge or that knowledge is impossible. 　Formal epistemology studies, among other things, the rules governing how knowledge and related states behave and in what relations they stand to each other. 　Science tries to acquire knowledge using the scientific method, which is based on repeatable experimentation, observation, and measurement. 　Many religions hold that humans should seek knowledge and that God or the divine is the source of knowledge.

<font size=3>
An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. 　The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. 　However, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors). 　"Artiste" (French for artist) is a variant used in English in this context, but this use has become rare. 　Use of the term "artist" to describe writers is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like used in criticism.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun>Sun</a> 

<font size=3>
The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 　It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. 　The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 　The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. 　Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 　Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. 　The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). 　As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). 　It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. 　Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. 　The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. 　It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. 　Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. 　This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. 　When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. 　It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. 　After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion. 　The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. 　The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. 　The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars. 　The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.

<font size=3>
A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. 　Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. 　A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges. 　Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. 　Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. 　High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. 　These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. 　Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. 　The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. 　The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).

<font size=3>
Cold is the presence of low temperature, especially in the atmosphere. 　In common usage, cold is often a subjective perception. 　A lower bound to temperature is absolute zero, defined as 0.00 K on the Kelvin scale, an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. 　This corresponds to −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale, and 0.00 °R on the Rankine scale. 　Since temperature relates to the thermal energy held by an object or a sample of matter, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the particle constituents of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter. 　If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and they would be at complete rest in the classical sense. 　The object could be described as having zero thermal energy. 　Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.

Material is a substance or mixture of substances that constitutes an object. 　Materials can be pure or impure, living or non-living matter. 　Materials can be classified on the basis of their physical and chemical properties, or on their geological origin or biological function. 　Materials science is the study of materials, their properties and their applications. 　Raw materials can be processed in different ways to influence their properties, by purification, shaping or the introduction of other materials. 　New materials can be produced from raw materials by synthesis. 　In industry, materials are inputs to manufacturing processes to produce products or more complex materials.

<font size=3>
An author is the writer of a book, article, play, or other written work. 　A broader definition of the word "author" states: "An author is 'the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.　'" Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work, i.e. the author. If more than one person created the work (i.e., multiple authors), then a case of joint authorship takes place. Copyright laws differ around the world. The United States Copyright Office, for example, defines copyright as "a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of 'original works of authorship.　'"

<font size=3>
Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter – the others being solid, liquid, and plasma. 　A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). 　A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. 　What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. 　This separation usually makes a colourless gas invisible to the human observer. 　The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. 　Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. 　High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases. 　For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.

<font size=3>
Temperature is a physical quantity that expresses quantitatively the perceptions of hotness and coldness. 　Temperature is measured with a thermometer. 　Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have relied on various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. 　The most common scales are the Celsius scale with the unit symbol °C (formerly called centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale (K), the latter being used predominantly for scientific purposes. 　The kelvin is one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI). 　Absolute zero, i.e., zero kelvin or −273.15 °C, is the lowest point in the thermodynamic temperature scale. 　Experimentally, it can be approached very closely but not actually reached, as recognized in the third law of thermodynamics. 　It would be impossible to extract energy as heat from a body at that temperature. 　Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material science, metallurgy, mechanical engineering and geography as well as most aspects of daily life.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture>Culture</a> 

<font size=3>
Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) is an umbrella term which encompasses the collective social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, which includes the collective knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. 　Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location. 　Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. 　A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group. 　Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change. 　Thus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. 　In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group. 　Cultural formation and change is the formation and reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. 　Cultures are formed or affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. 　Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies. 　Organizations like UNESCO attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

<font size=3>
Richard is a male given name. 　It originates, via Old French, from Old Frankish and is a compound of the words descending from Proto-Germanic *rīk- 'ruler, leader, king' and *hardu- 'strong, brave, hardy', and it therefore means 'strong in rule'. 　Nicknames include "Richie", "Dick", "Dickon", "Dickie", "Rich", "Rick", "Rico", "Ricky", and more. 　Richard is a common English, German and French male name. 　It's also used in many more languages, particularly Germanic, such as Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, and Dutch, as well as other languages including Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Finnish. 　Richard is cognate with variants of the name in other European languages, such as the Swedish "Rickard", the Catalan "Ricard" and the Italian "Riccardo", among others (see comprehensive variant list below).

<font size=3>
Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. 　The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. 　Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. 　The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe"). 　Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. 　Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general. 　A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances, as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a group of theatrical performers working together. 　Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. 　The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. 　They were influential to the development of musical theatre.

Paris (Ancient Greek: Πάρις), also known as Alexander (Ἀλέξανδρος, Aléxandros), the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, is a mythological nobleman that appears in a number of Greek legends. 　Of these appearances, probably the best known was the elopement with Helen, queen of Sparta, this being one of the immediate causes of the Trojan War. 　Later in the war, he fatally wounds Achilles in the heel with an arrow as foretold by Achilles's mother, Thetis. 　The name Paris is probably of Luwian origin, and comparable to Pari-zitis, attested as a Hittite scribe's name. 　The name Paris is etymologically unrelated to the name of the French city of Paris, which derives its name from a Gaulish tribe called the Parisii.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice>Justice</a> 

<font size=3>
Justice, in its broadest sense, is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, with the interpretation of what then constitutes "deserving" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness. 　The state will sometimes endeavor to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings. 　Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. 　Advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from God. 　In the 17th century, philosophers such as John Locke said that justice derives from natural law. 　Social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone. 　In the 19th century, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. 　Theories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. 　Egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. 　John Rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. 　Robert Nozick and others said that property rights, also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law, maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. 　Theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to ensure justice. 　The closely related restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.

Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. 　Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). 　By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants") which is sister of the Glaucophyta, and consists of the green algae and Embryophyta (land plants). 　The latter includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, and mosses. 　Most plants are multicellular organisms. 　Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. 　Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. 　Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. 　Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, however asexual reproduction is also common. 　There are about 320,000 known species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260,000–290,000, produce seeds. 　Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. 　Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. 　Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. 　The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(topology)>Cover (topology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover (or covering) of a set X {\displaystyle X} is a family of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} whose union is all of X {\displaystyle X} . 　More formally, if C = { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle C=\lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is an indexed family of subsets U α ⊂ X {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }\subset X} (indexed by the set A {\displaystyle A} ), then C {\displaystyle C} is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if ⋃ α ∈ A U α = X {\displaystyle \bigcup _{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha }=X} . 　Thus the collection { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle \lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if each element of X {\displaystyle X} belongs to at least one of the subsets U α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} . 　A subcover of a cover of a set is a subset of the cover that also covers the set. 　A cover is called an open cover if each of its element is an open set.

<font size=3>
A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural orbital period of the Moon; the words month and Moon are cognates. 　The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months ("lunations") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. 　From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. 　Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest>Forest</a> 

<font size=3>
A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. 　Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. 　The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use." 　Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020. 　Forests are the predominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are found around the globe. 　More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, and the United States). 　The largest share of forests (45 percent) are in the tropical latitudes, followed by those in the boreal, temperate, and subtropic domains. 　Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. 　Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests. 　Forests at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. 　Areas at higher elevations tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and the amount of precipitation also affects forest composition. 　Almost half the forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. 　Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. 　Roughly 80 percent of the world's forest area is found in patches larger than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres). 　The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches around the world – the vast majority less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in size. 　Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. 　Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. 　Forests can also affect people's health. 　Human activities, including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling>Feeling</a> 

<font size=3>
Feelings are subjective self-contained phenomenal experiences. 　According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, a feeling is "a self-contained phenomenal experience"; and feelings are "subjective, evaluative, and independent of the sensations, thoughts, or images evoking them". 　The term feeling is closely related to, but not the same as emotion. 　"Feeling" may for instance refer to the conscious subjective experience of emotions. 　The study of subjective experiences is referred to as phenomenology. 　The discipline of psychotherapy generally involves a therapist helping a client understand, articulate and learn to effectively regulate their own feelings and ultimately take responsibility for their experience of the world. 　Feelings are sometimes held to be characteristic of embodied consciousness. 　The English noun feelings may generally refer to any degree of subjectivity in perception or sensation. 　However, feelings often refer to an individual sense of well-being (perhaps of wholeness, safety or being loved.) Feelings have a semantic field extending from the individual and spiritual to the social and political. 　The word feeling may refer to any of a number of psychological characteristics of experience, or even to reflect the entire inner life of the individual (see mood.) As self-contained phenomenal experiences, evoked by sensations and perceptions, we might expect feelings to strongly influence the character of subjective reality; and indeed feelings may sometimes be seen to harbor bias or to in some way distort veridical perception, in particular through projection, wishful thinking, among many other such effects. 　Feeling may also describe the senses, with an exemplary case being the physical sensation of touch.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(river morphology)>Bar (river morphology)</a> 

<font size=3>
A bar in a river is an elevated region of sediment (such as sand or gravel) that has been deposited by the flow. 　Types of bars include mid-channel bars (also called braid bars and common in braided rivers), point bars (common in meandering rivers), and mouth bars (common in river deltas). 　The locations of bars are determined by the geometry of the river and the flow through it. 　Bars reflect sediment supply conditions, and can show where sediment supply rate is greater than the transport capacity. 　A mid-channel bar, is also often referred to as a braid bar because they are often found in braided river channels. 　Braided river channels are broad and shallow and found in areas where sediment is easily eroded like at a glacial outwash, or at a mountain front with high sediment loads. 　These types of river systems are associated with high slope, sediment supply, stream power, shear stress, and bed load transport rates. 　Braided rivers have complex and unpredictable channel patterns, and sediment size tends to vary among streams. 　It is these features that are responsible for the formations of braid bars. 　Braided streams are often overfed with massive amounts of sediment which creates multiple stream channels within one dominant pair of flood bank plains. 　These channels are separated by mid-channel or braid bars. 　Anastomosing river channels also create mid-channel bars, however they are typically vegetated bars, making them more permanent than the bars found in a braided river channel which have high rates of change because of the large amounts of non-cohesive sediment, lack of vegetation, and high stream powers found in braided river channels. 　Bars can also form mid-channel due to snags or logjams. 　For example, if a stable log is deposited mid-channel in a stream, this obstructs the flow and creates local flow convergence and divergence. 　This causes erosion on the upstream side of the obstruction and deposition on the downstream side. 　The deposition that occurs on the downstream side can create a central bar, and an arcuate bar can be formed as flow diverges upstream of the obstruction. 　Continuous deposition downstream can build up the central bar to form an island. 　Eventually the logjam can become partially buried, which protects the island from erosion, allowing for vegetation to begin to grow, and stabilize the area even further. 　Over time, the bar can eventually attach to one side of the channel bank and merge into the flood plain. 　A point bar is an area of deposition typically found in meandering rivers. 　Point bars form on the inside of meander bends in meandering rivers. 　As the flow moves around the inside of the bend in the river, the water slows down because of the shallow flow and low shear stresses there reduce the amount of material that can be carried there. 　Point bars are usually crescent shaped and located on the inside curve of the river bend. 　The excess material falls out of transport and, over time, forms a point bar. 　Point bars are typically found in the slowest moving, shallowest parts of rivers and streams, and are often parallel to the shore and occupy the area farthest from the thalweg, on the outside curve of the river bend in a meandering river. 　Here, at the deepest and fastest part of the stream is the cut bank, the area of a meandering river channel that continuously undergoes erosion. 　The faster the water in a river channel, the better it is able to pick up greater amounts of sediment, and larger pieces of sediment, which increases the river's bed load. 　Over a long enough period of time, the combination of deposition along point bars, and erosion along cut banks can lead to the formation of an oxbow lake. 　A mouth bar is an elevated region of sediment typically found at a river delta which is located at the mouth of a river where the river flows out to the ocean. 　Sediment is transported by the river and deposited, mid channel, at the mouth of the river. 　This occurs because, as the river widens at the mouth, the flow slows, and sediment settles out and is deposited. 　After initial formation of a river mouth bar, they have the tendency to prograde. 　This is caused by the pressure from the flow on the upstream face of the bar. 　This pressure creates erosion on that face of the bar, allowing the flow to transport this sediment over or around, and re-deposit it farther downstream, closer to the ocean. 　River mouth bars stagnate, or cease to prograde when the water depth above the flow is shallow enough to create a pressure on the upstream side of the bar strong enough to force the flow around the deposit rather than over the top of the bar. 　This divergent channel flow around either side of the sediment deposit continuously transports sediment, which over time is deposited on either side of this original mid channel deposit. 　As more and more sediment accumulates across the mouth of the river, it builds up to eventually create a sand bar that has the potential to extend the entire length of the river mouth and block the flow.

<font size=3>
Ireland (/ˈaɪərlənd/ (listen) YRE-lənd; Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə] (listen); Ulster-Scots: Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. 　It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. 　Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world. 　Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. 　As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. 　The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. 　Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. 　Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. 　Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, with most of it being non-native conifer plantations. 　The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. 　Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant. 　Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. 　The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards. 　Following the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. 　However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. 　In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. 　With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. 　A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. 　Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. 　This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. 　In 1973, the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland as part of it, did the same. 　In 2020, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, left what was by then the European Union (EU). 　Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. 　Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance. 　The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.

<font size=3>
In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. 　In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. 　In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. 　Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. 　The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. 　Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. 　Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. 　It is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world. 　A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. 　This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. 　For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. 　Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. 　Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. 　The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development. 　Trees usually reproduce using seeds. 　Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. 　Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead. 　Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. 　They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. 　Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. 　Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. 　Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. 　In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. 　Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Experience refers to conscious events in general, more specifically to perceptions, or to the practical knowledge and familiarity that is produced by these processes. 　Understood as a conscious event in the widest sense, experience involves a subject to which various items are presented. 　In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch presents the subject with the objects "bird" and "branch", the relation between them and the property "yellow". 　Unreal items may be included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or dreams. 　When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience. 　In this sense, experience is usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of conscious events, like thinking or imagining. 　In a slightly different sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce. 　In this sense, it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world is the source of knowledge. 　So an experienced hiker is someone who actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many books about hiking. 　This is associated both with recurrent past acquaintance and the abilities learned through them. 　Many scholarly debates on the nature of experience focus on experience as conscious event, either in the wide or the more restricted sense. 　One important topic in this field is the question of whether all experiences are intentional, i.e. are directed at objects different from themselves. 　Another debate focuses on the question of whether there are non-conceptual experiences and, if so, what role they could play in justifying beliefs. 　Some theorists claim that experiences are transparent, meaning that what an experience feels like only depends on the contents presented in this experience. 　Other theorists reject this claim by pointing out that what matters is not just what is presented but also how it is presented. 　A great variety of types of experiences is discussed in the academic literature. 　Perceptual experiences, for example, represent the external world through stimuli registered and transmitted by the senses. 　The experience of episodic memory, on the other hand, involves reliving a past event one experienced before. 　In imaginative experience, objects are presented without aiming to show how things actually are. 　The experience of thinking involves mental representations and the processing of information, in which ideas or propositions are entertained, judged or connected. 　Pleasure refers to experience that feels good. 　It is closely related to emotional experience, which has additionally evaluative, physiological and behavioral components. 　Moods are similar to emotions, with one key difference being that they lack a specific object found in emotions. 　Conscious desires involve the experience of wanting something. 　They play a central role in the experience of agency, in which intentions are formed, courses of action are planned, and decisions are taken and realized. 　Non-ordinary experience refers to rare experiences that significantly differ from the experience in the ordinary waking state, like religious experiences, out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences. 　Experience is discussed in various disciplines. 　Phenomenology is the science of the structure and contents of experience. 　It uses different methods, like epoché or eidetic variation. 　Sensory experience is of special interest to epistemology. 　An important traditional discussion in this field concerns whether all knowledge is based on sensory experience, as empiricists claim, or not, as rationalists contend. 　This is closely related to the role of experience in science, in which experience is said to act as a neutral arbiter between competing theories. 　In metaphysics, experience is involved in the mind-body problem and the hard problem of consciousness, both of which try to explain the relation between matter and experience. 　In psychology, some theorists hold that all concepts are learned from experience while others argue that some concepts are innate.

<font size=3>
In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles). 　It can also be defined as a rectangle with two equal-length adjacent sides. 　It is the only regular polygon whose internal angle, central angle, and external angle are all equal (90°), and whose diagonals are all equal in length. 　A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ {\displaystyle \square } ABCD.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract>Contract</a> 

<font size=3>
Look up obligor or obligee in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A contract is an agreement that specifies certain legally enforceable rights and obligations pertaining to two or more mutually agreeing parties. 　A contract typically involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date. 　In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission. 　A binding agreement between actors in international law is known as a treaty. 　Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured. 　Like other areas of private law, contract law varies between jurisdictions. 　In general, contract law is exercised and governed either under common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, or mixed-law jurisdictions that combine elements of both common and civil law. 　Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed-law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties. 　Within the overarching category of civil law jurisdictions, there are several distinct varieties of contract law with their own distinct criteria: the German tradition is characterised by the unique doctrine of abstraction, systems based on the Napoleonic Code are characterised by their systematic distinction between different types of contracts, and Roman-Dutch law is largely based on the writings of renaissance-era Dutch jurists and case law applying general principles of Roman law prior to the Netherlands' adoption of the Napoleonic Code. 　The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, published in 2016, aim to provide a general harmonised framework for international contracts, independent of the divergences between national laws, as well as a statement of common contractual principles for arbitrators and judges to apply where national laws are lacking. 　Notably, the Principles reject the doctrine of consideration, arguing that elimination of the doctrine "bring[s] about greater certainty and reduce litigation" in international trade. 　The Principles also rejected the abstraction principle on the grounds that it and similar doctrines are "not easily compatible with modern business perceptions and practice". 　Contract law can be contrasted with tort law (also referred to in some jurisdictions as the law of delicts), the other major area of the law of obligations. 　While tort law generally deals with private duties and obligations that exist by operation of law, and provide remedies for civil wrongs committed between individuals not in a pre-existing legal relationship, contract law provides for the creation and enforcement of duties and obligations through a prior agreement between parties. 　The emergence of quasi-contracts, quasi-torts, and quasi-delicts renders the boundary between tort and contract law somewhat uncertain.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin>Skin</a> 

<font size=3>
Skin is the layer of usually soft, flexible outer tissue covering the body of a vertebrate animal, with three main functions: protection, regulation, and sensation. 　Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton, have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. 　The adjective cutaneous means "of the skin" (from Latin cutis 'skin'). 　In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments, and internal organs. 　Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. 　Skin (including cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues) plays crucial roles in formation, structure, and function of extraskeletal apparatus such as horns of bovids (e.g., cattle) and rhinos, cervids' antlers, giraffids' ossicones, armadillos' osteoderm, and os penis/os clitoris. 　All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises that appear to be hairless. 　The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. 　For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. 　Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. 　Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. 　This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. 　The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. 　In humans, for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin on the body at 0.5 mm thick and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as "crows feet" and wrinkles. 　The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is the thickest skin on the body as 4 mm thick. 　The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen. 　Fur is dense hair. 　Primarily, fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. 　On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick and can be processed to create leather. 　Reptiles and most fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough beta-keratins. 　Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin, and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. 　For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly as the chemical diffuses through its skin. 　Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.

<font size=3>
In ordinary language, an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers, usually the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list (the arithmetic mean). 　For example, the average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5. 　Depending on the context, an average might be another statistic such as the median, or mode. 　For example, the average personal income is often given as the median—the number below which are 50% of personal incomes and above which are 50% of personal incomes—because the mean would be higher by including personal incomes from a few billionaires. 　For this reason, it is recommended to avoid using the word "average" when discussing measures of central tendency.

<font size=3>
A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. 　Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 　These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. 　A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. 　This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster. 　A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. 　Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. 　Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users. 　Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. 　Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. 　Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. 　More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. 　The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. 　The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. 　The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries. 　Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. 　The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. 　Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). 　Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

In modern politics, and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government. 　Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. 　The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies. 　Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e.g., the Parliament of Ghana), even where it is not in the official name. 　Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, an example being the French medieval and early modern parlements.

In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed (commonly referred to as v) of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position over time or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time; it is thus a scalar quantity. 　The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. 　Speed is not the same as velocity. 　Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. 　The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). 　For air and marine travel, the knot is commonly used. 　The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). 　Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. 　In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.
