## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excuse>Excuse</a> 
<font size=3>
In jurisprudence, an excuse is a defense to criminal charges that is distinct from an exculpation. 　Justification and excuse are different defenses in a criminal case (See Justification and excuse). 　Exculpation is a related concept which reduces or extinguishes a person's culpability, such as a their liability to pay compensation to the victim of a tort in the civil law. 　The excuse provides a mitigating factor for a group of persons sharing a common characteristic. 　Justification, as in justifiable homicide, vindicates or shows the justice. 　Thus, society approves of the purpose or motives underpinning some actions or the consequences flowing from them (see Robinson[clarification needed]), and distinguishes those where the behavior cannot be approved but some excuse may be found in the characteristics of the defendant, e.g. that the accused was a serving police officer or suffering from a mental illness. 　Thus, a justification describes the quality of the act, whereas an excuse relates to the status or capacity (or lack of it) in the accused. 　These factors can affect the resulting judgment which may be an acquittal, or in the case of a conviction may mitigate sentencing. 　An excuse may also be something that a person or persons use to explain any criticism or comments based on the outcome of any specific event.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning>Lightning</a> 
<font size=3>
Lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during which two electrically charged regions, both in the atmosphere or with one on the ground, temporarily neutralize themselves, causing the instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy. 　This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. 　Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. 　Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. 　The three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single thundercloud (intra-cloud), between two clouds (cloud-to-cloud), or between a cloud and the ground (cloud-to-ground). 　Many other observational variants are recognized, including "heat lightning", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; dry lightning, which can cause forest fires; and ball lightning, which is rarely observed scientifically. 　Humans have deified lightning for millennia. 　Idiomatic expressions derived from lightning, such as the English expression "bolt from the blue", are common across languages. 　At all times people have been fascinated by the sight and difference of lightning. 　The fear of lightning is called astraphobia. 　The first known photograph of lightning is from 1847, by Thomas Martin Easterly. 　The first surviving photograph is from 1882, by William Nicholson Jennings, a photographer who spent half his life capturing pictures of lightning and proving its diversity.

<font size=3>
A goddess is a female deity. 　In many known cultures, goddesses are often linked with literal or metaphorical pregnancy or imagined feminine roles associated with how women and girls are perceived or expected to behave. 　This includes themes of spinning, weaving, beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, domesticity, creativity, and fertility (exemplified by the ancient mother goddess cult). 　Many major goddesses are also associated with magic, war, strategy, hunting, farming, wisdom, fate, earth, sky, power, laws, justice, and more. 　Some themes, such as discord or disease, which are considered negative within their cultural contexts also are found associated with some goddesses. 　There are as many differently described and understood goddesses as there are male, shapeshifting, or neuter gods. 　In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. 　For example, Shaktism, the worship of the female force that animates the world, is one of the three major sects of Hinduism. 　Polytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honor multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. 　These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness>Consciousness</a> 
<font size=3>
Consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience and awareness of internal and external existence. 　However, the lack of definitions has led to millennia of analyses, explanations and debates by philosophers, theologians, linguists, and scientists. 　Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. 　In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind. 　In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition. 　Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling or perception. 　It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, or self-awareness either continuously changing or not. 　The disparate range of research, notions and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked. 　Examples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event or mental process of the brain.

<font size=3>
According to Abrahamic religions, Aaron (/ˈærən/ or /ˈɛərən/) was a prophet, a high priest, and the elder brother of Moses. 　Knowledge of Aaron, along with his brother Moses, exclusively comes from religious texts, such as the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. 　The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). 　When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the enslavement of the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to the Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1). 　Part of the Law given to Moses at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. 　Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river. 　According to the Book of Numbers, he died and was buried on Mount Hor, Deuteronomy however places these events at Moserah. 　Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible (Luke, Acts, and Hebrews).

Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. 　It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships. 　Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its everyday meaning. 　For example, a person with a mental disorder, a low mental age, or under the legal age of sexual consent may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law. 　United Nations agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a comprehensive sexuality education is beneficial. 　Types of consent include implied consent, express consent, informed consent and unanimous consent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum>Drum</a> 
<font size=3>
The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. 　In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. 　Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. 　There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. 　Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. 　Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. 　Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. 　Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. 　A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight>Midnight</a> 
<font size=3>
Midnight is the transition time from one day to the next – the moment when the date changes, on the local official clock time for any particular jurisdiction. 　By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours. 　Solar midnight is the time opposite to solar noon, when the Sun is closest to the nadir, and the night is equidistant from dusk and dawn. 　Due to the advent of time zones, which regularize time across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, solar midnight rarely coincides with 12 midnight on the clock. 　Solar midnight depends on longitude and time of the year rather than on time zone. 　In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between sunset and sunrise (i.e., solar midnight), varying according to the seasons. 　In some Slavic languages, "midnight" has an additional geographic association with "north" (as "noon" does with "south"). 　Modern Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Serbian languages preserve this association with their words for "midnight" or "half-night" (północ, поўнач, північ, пoнoħ) also meaning "north."

<font size=3>
A grain is a small, hard, dry fruit (caryopsis) – with or without an attached hull layer – harvested for human or animal consumption. 　A grain crop is a grain-producing plant. 　The two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes. 　After being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other staple foods, such as starchy fruits (plantains, breadfruit, etc.) and tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava, and more). 　This durability has made grains well suited to industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in silos, and milled for flour or pressed for oil. 　Thus, the grain market is a major global commodity market that includes crops such as maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other grains.

<font size=3>
A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as fossil conulariids. 　Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has deposited in concentric layers. 　The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur. 　The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. 　Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable. 　The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. 　These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. 　Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. 　Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry. 　Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry, but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. 　They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines and paint formulations. 　Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them. 　However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls (technically "calcareous concretions") of lesser shine or less spherical shape. 　Although these may also be legitimately referred to as "pearls" by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, most of them have no value except as curiosities.

<font size=3>
Slavery and enslavement are the experience of being a slave, who is someone forbidden to quit serving an enslaver, and is treated by the enslaver as property. 　Slavery typically involves some form of work, while the worker’s location or residence is dictated by the enslaver. 　Many historical cases of enslavement occurred as a result of breaking the law, becoming indebted, or suffering a military defeat; other forms of slavery were instituted along demographic lines such as race. 　Slaves may be kept in bondage for life, or for a fixed period of time after which they would be granted freedom. 　Although slavery is usually involuntary and involves coercion, there are also cases where people voluntarily enter into slavery to pay a debt or earn money due to poverty. 　In the course of human history, slavery was a typical feature of civilization, and was legal in most societies, but it is now outlawed in most countries of the world, except as a punishment for a crime. 　In chattel slavery, the slave is legally rendered the personal property (chattel) of the slave owner. 　In economics, the term de facto slavery describes the conditions of unfree labour and forced labour that most slaves endure. 　In 2019, approximately 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved throughout the world despite it being illegal. 　In the modern world, more than 50 percent of slaves provide forced labour, usually in the factories and sweatshops of the private sector of a country's economy. 　In industrialised countries, human trafficking is a modern variety of slavery; in non-industrialised countries, enslavement by debt bondage is a common form of enslaving a person, such as captive domestic servants, forced marriage, and child soldiers.

Sake, also spelled saké (sake (酒, Sake) /ˈsɑːki, ˈsækeɪ/ SAH-kee, SAK-ay; also referred to as Japanese rice wine), is an alcoholic beverage of Japanese origin made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. 　Despite the name Japanese rice wine, sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes. 　The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. 　Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. 　The alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3–9% ABV, wine generally contains 9–16% ABV, and undiluted sake contains 18–20% ABV (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water before bottling). 　In Japanese, the character sake (kanji: 酒, Japanese pronunciation: [sake]) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒; meaning 'Japanese alcoholic drink'). 　Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word seishu (清酒; 'refined alcohol'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation. 　In Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a sakazuki. 　As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type. 　Sake now enjoys an international reputation. 　Of the more than 800 junmai ginjō-shu evaluated by Robert Parker's team, 78 received a score of 90 or more (eRobertParker，2016).

<font size=3>
Abraham (originally Abram) is the common Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 　In Judaism, he is the founding father of the special relationship between the Jews and God; in Christianity, he is the spiritual progenitor of all believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish; and in Islam, he is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam (see Adam in Islam) and culminates in Muhammad. 　The story of the life of Abraham as told in the narrative of the Book of Genesis, revolves around the themes of posterity and land. 　He is said to have been called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land of Canaan, which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. 　This promise is subsequently inherited by Isaac, Abraham's son by his wife Sarah, while Isaac's half-brother Ishmael is also promised that he will be the founder of a great nation. 　Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance. 　Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives "all Abraham's goods" while the other sons receive only "gifts". 　Most historians view the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus and the period of the biblical judges, as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era; and after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical Abraham. 　It is largely concluded that the Torah was composed during the early Persian period (late-6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their "father Abraham", and the returning exiles who based their counterclaim on Moses and the Exodus tradition of the Israelites.

A skill is the learned ability to act with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. 　Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. 　For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job. 　Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used. 　A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in the art of medicine or the art of war. 　Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts. 　People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy. 　A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. 　Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual. 　The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

Coordinates: 22°00′N 80°00′W﻿ / ﻿22.000°N 80.000°W﻿ / 22.000; -80.000 Cuba (/ˈkjuːbə/ (listen) KEW-bə, Spanish: [ˈkuβa] (listen)), officially the Republic of Cuba (Spanish: República de Cuba [reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkuβa] (listen)), is an island country comprising the island of Cuba, as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. 　Cuba is located where the northern Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean meet. 　Cuba is located east of the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico), south of both the American state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic), and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. 　Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. 　The official area of the Republic of Cuba is 109,884 km2 (42,426 sq mi) (without the territorial waters) but a total of 350,730 km2 (135,420 sq mi) including the exclusive economic zone. 　Cuba is the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Haiti, with over 11 million inhabitants. 　The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney people from the 4th millennium BC with the Guanahatabey and Taíno peoples until Spanish colonization in the 15th century. 　From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain, and slavery was abolished in 1886, remaining a Spanish colony until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained independence in 1902. 　In 1940, Cuba implemented a new constitution, but mounting political unrest culminated in a coup in 1952 and the subsequent dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which was later overthrown in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement during the Cuban Revolution, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. 　The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. 　Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced a severe economic downturn in the 1990s, known as the Special Period. 　In 2008, Fidel Castro resigned after 49 years of leadership of Cuba and was replaced by his brother Raúl Castro. 　Cuba is one of a few extant Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist states, in which the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution. 　Cuba has an authoritarian regime where political opposition is not permitted. 　Censorship of information (including limits to Internet access) is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom. 　Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America. 　It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the Taíno Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of enslaved Africans and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War. 　Cuba is a founding member of the United Nations, G77, Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, ALBA, and Organization of American States. 　It has currently one of the world's few planned economies, and its economy is dominated by the tourism industry and the exports of skilled labor, sugar, tobacco, and coffee. 　Cuba has historically—both before and during communist rule—performed better than other countries in the region on several socioeconomic indicators, such as literacy, infant mortality and life expectancy.
