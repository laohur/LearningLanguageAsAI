<font size=3>
Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time (e.g. 60 km/h northbound). 　Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. 　Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. 　The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1). 　For example, "5 metres per second" is a scalar, whereas "5 metres per second east" is a vector. 　If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration.

Rain Typical sound of rain with thunder Problems playing this file? 　See media help. 　Rain is water droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then fall under gravity. 　Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. 　It provides water for hydroelectric power plants, crop irrigation, and suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems. 　The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. 　If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. 　In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. 　On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. 　The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes. 　The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. 　Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics. 　Antarctica is the driest continent. 　The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in). 　Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. 　Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. 　Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar. 　Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water.

<font size=3>
Darkness, the direct opposite of lightness, is defined as a lack of illumination, an absence of visible light, or a surface that absorbs light, such as black. 　Human vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance because the hue sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient, in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision. 　The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures, often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling. 　Referring to a time of day, complete darkness occurs when the Sun is more than 18° below the horizon, without the effects of twilight on the night sky.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope>Pope</a> 
<font size=3>
The pope (Latin: papa, from Greek: πάππας, romanized: pappas, lit. 'father'), also known as supreme pontiff (pontifex maximus or summus pontifex), Roman pontiff (Romanus pontifex) or sovereign pontiff, is the bishop of Rome (or historically the patriarch of Rome), head of the worldwide Catholic Church, and has also served as the head of state or sovereign of the Papal States and later the Vatican City State since the eighth century. 　From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of "binding and loosing", naming him as the "rock" upon which the Church would be built. 　The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013. 　While his office is called the papacy, the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See. 　It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State, a city-state which forms a geographical enclave within the conurbation of Rome, established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal and spiritual independence. 　The Holy See is recognized by its adherence at various levels to international organizations and by means of its diplomatic relations and political accords with many independent states. 　According to Catholic tradition, the apostolic see of Rome was founded by Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the first century. 　The papacy is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in human history. 　In ancient times, the popes helped spread Christianity and intervened to find resolutions in various doctrinal disputes. 　In the Middle Ages, they played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs. 　In addition to the expansion of Christian faith and doctrine, modern popes are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of human rights. 　Over time, the papacy accrued broad secular and political influence, eventually rivaling those of territorial rulers. 　In recent centuries, the temporal authority of the papacy has declined and the office is now largely focused on religious matters. 　By contrast, papal claims of spiritual authority have been increasingly firmly expressed over time, culminating in 1870 with the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for rare occasions when the pope speaks ex cathedra—literally "from the chair (of Saint Peter)"—to issue a formal definition of faith or morals. 　The pope is considered one of the world's most powerful people due to the extensive diplomatic, cultural, and spiritual influence of his position on both 1.3 billion Catholics and those outside the Catholic faith, and because he heads the world's largest non-government provider of education and health care, with a vast network of charities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire>Vampire</a> 
<font size=3>
A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. 　In European folklore, vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. 　They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. 　Vampiric entities have been recorded in cultures around the world; the term vampire was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in Southeastern and Eastern Europe that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism. 　Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania, vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania. 　In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra) still persists in some cultures. 　Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. 　Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited. 　The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "The Vampyre" by the English writer John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. 　Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 novel Carmilla. 　The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, television shows, and video games. 　The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.

In road transport, a lane is part of a roadway that is designated to be used by a single line of vehicles to control and guide drivers and reduce traffic conflicts. 　Most public roads (highways) have at least two lanes, one for traffic in each direction, separated by lane markings. 　On multilane roadways and busier two-lane roads, lanes are designated with road surface markings. 　Major highways often have two multi-lane roadways separated by a median. 　Some roads and bridges that carry very low volumes of traffic are less than 4.6 metres (15 ft) wide, and are only a single lane wide. 　Vehicles travelling in opposite directions must slow or stop to pass each other. 　In rural areas, these are often called country lanes. 　In urban areas, alleys are often only one lane wide. 　Urban and suburban one lane roads are often designated for one-way traffic.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery>Artillery</a> 
<font size=3>
Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. 　Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. 　As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use. 　This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.　[citation needed] Originally, the word "artillery" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor. 　Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, "artillery" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars (collectively called barrel artillery, cannon artillery, gun artillery, or—a layman term—tube artillery), and rocket artillery. 　In common speech, the word "artillery" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called "equipment". 　However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses "artillery piece", but most English-speaking armies use "gun" and "mortar". 　The projectiles fired are typically either "shot" (if solid) or "shell" (if not solid). 　Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used. 　"Shell" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions. 　By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines. 　In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility. 　In the 20th century, technology-based target acquisition devices (such as radar) and systems (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged in order to acquire targets, primarily for artillery. 　These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms. 　The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm. 　Artillery has been used since at least the early Industrial Revolution. 　The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery. 　In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was "the god of war".

<font size=3>
Chose (pronounced: /ʃoʊz/, French for "thing") is a term used in common law tradition to refer to rights in property, specifically a combined bundle of rights. 　A chose describes the enforcement right which a party possesses in an object. 　The use of chose extends from the English use of French within the courts. 　In English and commonwealth law, all personal things fall into one of two categories, either choses in action or choses in possession. 　English law uses a chose to refer to a bundle of rights, traditionally relating to property which may be utilised in certain circumstances. 　Thus, a chose in action refers to a bundle of personal rights which can only be enforced or claimed by a chose-holder bringing an action through the court to enforce the action. 　In English law, this category is enormously wide. 　This is contrasted with a chose in possession which represents rights which can be enforced or acquired by taking physical possession of the chose. 　This may be, for example a legal mortgage. 　Both choses in possession and choses in action create separate proprietary interests. 　What differs between each is the method in which each chose may be enforced. 　This is dependent on the possessory nature of the reference object. 　Alternative, historical uses includes a chose local, a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill; a chose transitory, something movable that can be carried from place to place.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera>Camera</a> 
<font size=3>
A camera is an optical instrument that captures images. 　Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture 3D images. 　At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed box (the camera body), with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light to pass through and capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film). 　Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to the light. 　The still image camera is a key instrument in the art of photography. 　Captured images may be reproduced later through processes such as digital imaging or photographic printing. 　Similar artistic fields in the moving-image camera domain include film, videography, and cinematography. 　The word camera comes from camera obscura, which is Latin for "dark chamber" and refers to the original device used to project a 2D image onto a flat surface. 　The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. 　The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.

<font size=3>
Credit (from Latin verb credit, meaning "one believes") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date. 　The resources provided by the first party can be either property, fulfillment of promises, or performances. 　In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people. 　The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). 　Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment. 　Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident>Accident</a> 
<font size=3>
An accident is an unintended, normally unwanted event that was not directly caused by humans. 　The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks. 　Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity. 　For example, when a tree falls down during a wind storm, its fall may not have been caused by humans, but the tree's type, size, health, location, or improper maintenance may have contributed to the result. 　Most car wrecks are not true accidents; however English speakers started using that word in the mid-20th century as a result of media manipulation by the US automobile industry.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing>Drawing</a> 
<font size=3>
Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. 　Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). 　Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer. 　Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. 　There are many digital art programs and devices. 　A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. 　The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. 　Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. 　Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. 　It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. 　The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities. 　In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. 　A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. 　An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.
