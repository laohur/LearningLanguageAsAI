## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid>Liquid</a> 

<font size=3>
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. 　As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. 　A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. 　Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. 　Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. 　Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. 　A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. 　Water is by far the most common liquid on Earth. 　The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than that of a gas. 　Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. 　On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. 　Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. 　Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or plasma from within stars.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore>Shore</a> 

<font size=3>
A shore or a shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake. 　In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, representing the intertidal zone where there is one. 　In contrast to a coast, a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an ocean or a sea. 　Therefore, in that sense, a coast is a type of shore. 　However, the word "coast" often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior. 　Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, such as waves. 　The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal>Coal</a> 

<font size=3>
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. 　Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. 　Coal is a type of fossil fuel, formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. 　Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands called coal forests that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times. 　Many significant coal deposits are younger than this and originate from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. 　Coal is used primarily as a fuel. 　While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited until the Industrial Revolution. 　With the invention of the steam engine, coal consumption increased. 　In 2020, coal supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and over a third of its electricity. 　Some iron and steel-making and other industrial processes burn coal. 　The extraction and use of coal causes premature death and illness. 　The use of coal damages the environment, and it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. 　Fourteen billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted by burning coal in 2020, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and over 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. 　As part of worldwide energy transition, many countries have reduced or eliminated their use of coal power. 　The United Nations Secretary General asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020. 　Global coal use peaked in 2013. 　To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming below 2 °C (3.6 °F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030, and phasing out coal was agreed upon in the Glasgow Climate Pact. 　The largest consumer and importer of coal in 2020 was China, which accounts for almost half the world's annual coal production, followed by India with about a tenth. 　Indonesia and Australia export the most, followed by Russia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester>Manchester</a> 

<font size=3>
Manchester (/ˈmæntʃɪstər, -tʃɛs-/) is a city in Greater Manchester, England. 　It had a population of 552,000 in 2021. 　It is bordered by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east, and the neighbouring city of Salford to the west. 　The two cities and the surrounding towns form one of the United Kingdom's most populous conurbations, the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, which has a population of 2.87 million. 　The history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort (castra) of Mamucium or Mancunium, established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. 　Historically part of Lancashire, areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated into Manchester in the 20th century, including Wythenshawe in 1931. 　Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township, but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century. 　Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. 　Manchester achieved city status in 1853. 　The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to the Irish Sea, 36 miles (58 km) to the west. 　Its fortune declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, and the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration. 　Following considerable redevelopment, Manchester was the host city for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. 　The city is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. 　Manchester Liverpool Road railway station was the world's first inter-city passenger railway station. 　At the University of Manchester, Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917, Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world's first stored-program computer in 1948, and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the first graphene in 2004.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi>Pi</a> 

<font size=3>
The number π (/paɪ/; spelled out as "pi") is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. 　The number π appears in many formulas across mathematics and physics. 　It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as 22 7 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {22}{7}}} are commonly used to approximate it. 　Consequently, its decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. 　It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be a solution of an equation involving only sums, products, powers, and integers. 　The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. 　The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed, but no proof of this conjecture has been found. 　For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of π, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. 　Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations. 　Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy. 　In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematicians approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematicians made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. 　The first computational formula for π, based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later. 　The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706. 　The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of π, enough for all practical scientific computations. 　Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of π to many trillions of digits. 　These computations are motivated by the development of efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the human quest to break records. 　The extensive computations involved have also been used to test supercomputers. 　Because its definition relates to the circle, π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses and spheres. 　It is also found in formulae from other topics in science, such as cosmology, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism. 　In modern mathematical analysis, it is often instead defined without any reference to geometry; therefore, it also appears in areas having little to do with geometry, such as number theory and statistics. 　The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants inside and outside of science. 　Several books devoted to π have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering>Scattering</a> 

<font size=3>
Scattering is a term used in physics to describe a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form, such as light or sound, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by localized non-uniformities (including particles and radiation) in the medium through which they pass. 　In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. 　Reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections. 　Originally, the term was confined to light scattering (going back at least as far as Isaac Newton in the 17th century). 　As more "ray"-like phenomena were discovered, the idea of scattering was extended to them, so that William Herschel could refer to the scattering of "heat rays" (not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature) in 1800. 　John Tyndall, a pioneer in light scattering research, noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s. 　Near the end of the 19th century, the scattering of cathode rays (electron beams) and X-rays was observed and discussed. 　With the discovery of subatomic particles (e.g. Ernest Rutherford in 1911) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century, the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena. 　Scattering can refer to the consequences of particle-particle collisions between molecules, atoms, electrons, photons and other particles. 　Examples include: cosmic ray scattering in the Earth's upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside particle accelerators; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors. 　The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as scatterers or scattering centers, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes particles, bubbles, droplets, density fluctuations in fluids, crystallites in polycrystalline solids, defects in monocrystalline solids, surface roughness, cells in organisms, and textile fibers in clothing. 　The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory. 　Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, medical ultrasound, semiconductor wafer inspection, polymerization process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and computer-generated imagery. 　Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. 　In Particle Physics the quantum interaction and scattering of fundamental particles is described by the Scattering Matrix or S-Matrix, introduced and developed by John Archibald Wheeler and Werner Heisenberg. 　Scattering is quantified using many different concepts, including scattering cross section (σ), attenuation coefficients, the bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF), S-matrices, and mean free path.

In Newtonian mechanics, momentum (more specifically linear momentum or translational momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. 　It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. 　If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum p is : p = m v . 　{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} .　} In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg⋅m/s), which is equivalent to the newton-second. 　Newton's second law of motion states that the rate of change of a body's momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. 　Momentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. 　Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form, in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity. 　It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry. 　Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. 　In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. 　The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave function. 　The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 　In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier–Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip>Philip</a> 

<font size=3>
Philip, also Phillip, is a male given name, derived from the Greek Φίλιππος (Philippos, lit. "horse-loving" or "fond of horses"), from a compound of φίλος (philos, "dear", "loved", "loving") and ἵππος (hippos, "horse"). 　Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedonia and one of the apostles of early Christianity. 　Philip has many alternative spellings. 　One derivation often used as a surname is Phillips. 　It was also found during ancient Greek times with two Ps as Philippides and Philippos. 　It has many diminutive (or even hypocoristic) forms including Phil, Philly, Lip, Pip, Pep or Peps. 　There are also feminine forms such as Philippine and Philippa.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(psychology)>Construct (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Construct (psychology), also hypothetical construct or psychological construct, is a tool used to facilitate understanding of human behavior. 　A psychological construct is a label for a domain of behaviors. 　Behavioral sciences use constructs such as conscientiousness, intelligence, political power, self-esteem, and group culture. 　For example, if a student sees another sitting in a classroom before an examination biting her nails and fidgeting, the interpretation might be that she is experiencing anxiety. 　In that case, anxiety is a construct that underlies the behavior that is observed. 　Cognitive psychologists view constructs as hypothesized causes for certain behaviors, whereas behavioral psychologists view constructs as only descriptors of behaviors. 　A construct derives its name from the fact that it is a mental construction, derived from scientific process: observing natural phenomena, inferring the common features of those observations, and constructing a label for the commonality or the underlying cause. 　A construct derives its scientific value from the shared meaning it represents for different people. 　If a construct is clearly articulated and the phenomena it encompasses are clearly defined, it becomes a useful conceptual tool that facilitates communication. 　Once defined, constructs become objects of conceptual scrutiny in their own right. 　Constructs summarize behavioral domains. 　Constructs are the building blocks of scientific theories.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance>Insurance</a> 

<font size=3>
Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. 　It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss. 　An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier, or underwriter. 　A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. 　The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. 　The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. 　Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship. 　The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured, or their designated beneficiary or assignee. 　The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. 　If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. 　A mandatory out-of-pocket expense required by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called a deductible (or if required by a health insurance policy, a copayment). 　The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat>Cat</a> 

<font size=3>
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. 　It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. 　Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. 　Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. 　About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. 　The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. 　Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 　Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 　Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. 　As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. 　It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. 　It also secretes and perceives pheromones. 　Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. 　Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. 　Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species. 　It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC. 　As of 2021,[update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. 　As of 2017,[update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. 　In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[update]

<font size=3>
Earl (/ɜːrl, ɜːrəl/) is a rank of the nobility in the United Kingdom. 　The title originates in the Old English word eorl, meaning "a man of noble birth or rank". 　The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant "chieftain", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. 　After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer). 　Alternative names for the rank equivalent to "earl" or "count" in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the hakushaku (伯爵) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era. 　In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount. 　A feminine form of earl never developed; instead, countess is used.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension>Dimension</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. 　Thus, a line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it – for example, the point at 5 on a number line. 　A surface, such as the boundary of a cylinder or sphere, has a dimension of two (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it – for example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. 　A two-dimensional Euclidean space is a two-dimensional space on the plane. 　The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. 　In classical mechanics, space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time. 　That conception of the world is a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. 　The four dimensions (4D) of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. 　Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. 　10 dimensions are used to describe superstring theory (6D hyperspace + 4D), 11 dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory (7D hyperspace + 4D), and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space. 　The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. 　High-dimensional spaces frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. 　They may be Euclidean spaces or more general parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space in which we live.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity>Gravity</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight') is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. 　Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. 　As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. 　However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 　On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans (the corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the Earth and Moon orbiting one another). 　Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms. 　Investigation into the effects of weightlessness has shown that gravity may play a role in immune system function and cell differentiation within the human body. 　The gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the universe allowed it to coalesce and form stars which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. 　Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away. 　Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. 　The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon. 　However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: F = G m 1 m 2 r 2 , {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}},} where F is the force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting, r is the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. 　Current models of particle physics imply that the earliest instance of gravity in the universe, possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or a gravitational singularity, along with ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck epoch (up to 10−43 seconds after the birth of the universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle, in a currently unknown manner. 　Scientists are currently working to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a theory of everything) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation>Radiation</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. 　This includes: electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ) particle radiation, such as alpha radiation (α), beta radiation (β), proton radiation and neutron radiation (particles of non-zero rest energy) acoustic radiation, such as ultrasound, sound, and seismic waves (dependent on a physical transmission medium) gravitational radiation, that takes the form of gravitational waves, or ripples in the curvature of spacetime Radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or non-ionizing depending on the energy of the radiated particles. 　Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 eV, which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds. 　This is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms. 　A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit α, β, or γ radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons, respectively. 　Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere. 　Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　The word "ionize" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. 　Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. 　The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. 　Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. 　These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies. 　The word "radiation" arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. 　This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. 　Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. 　Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.

Coordinates: 47°20′N 13°20′E﻿ / ﻿47.333°N 13.333°E﻿ / 47.333; 13.333 Austria, formally the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in the southern part of Central Europe, lying in the Eastern Alps. 　It is a federation of nine states, one of which is the capital, Vienna, the most populous city and state. 　A landlocked country, Austria is bordered by Germany to the northwest, the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia to the northeast, Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. 　The country occupies an area of 83,871 km2 (32,383 sq mi) and has a population of 9 million. 　Austria emerged from the remnants of the Eastern and Hungarian March at the end of the first millennium. 　Originally a margraviate of Bavaria, it developed into a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in 1156 and was later made an archduchy in 1453. 　In the 16th century, Vienna began serving as the empire's administrative capital and Austria thus became the heartland of the Habsburg monarchy. 　After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Austria established its own empire, which became a great power and the dominant member of the German Confederation. 　The empire's defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 led to the end of the Confederation and paved the way for the establishment of Austria-Hungary a year later. 　After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, Emperor Franz Joseph declared war on Serbia, which ultimately escalated into World War I. 　The empire's defeat and subsequent collapse led to the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918 and the First Austrian Republic in 1919. 　During the interwar period, anti-parliamentarian sentiments culminated in the formation of an Austrofascist dictatorship under Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934. 　A year before the outbreak of World War II, Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany by Adolf Hitler, and it became a sub-national division. 　After its liberation in 1945 and a decade of Allied occupation, the country regained its sovereignty and declared its perpetual neutrality in 1955. 　Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy with a popularly elected president as head of state and a chancellor as head of government and chief executive. 　Major cities include Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. 　Austria is consistently listed as one of the richest countries in the world by GDP per capita and one of the countries with the highest standard of living; it was ranked 25th in the world for its Human Development Index in 2021. 　Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 and of the European Union since 1995. 　It hosts the OSCE and OPEC and is a founding member of the OECD and Interpol. 　It also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995, and adopted the euro currency in 1999.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite>Satellite</a> 

<font size=3>
A satellite or artificial satellite is an object intentionally placed into orbit in outer space. 　Satellites have a variety of uses, including communication relay, weather forecasting, navigation (GPS), broadcasting, scientific research, and Earth observation. 　Additional military uses are reconnaissance, early warning, signals intelligence and, potentially, weapon delivery. 　Other satellites include the final rocket stages that placed satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that are now defunct. 　Except for passive satellites, most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board, such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). 　Most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations, called transponders. 　Many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work, the most popular of which is small CubeSats. 　Similar satellites can work together as a group, forming constellations. 　Because of the high launch cost to space, satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. 　Most communication satellites are radio relay stations in orbit and carry dozens of transponders, each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz. 　Satellites are placed from the surface to orbit by launch vehicles, high enough to avoid orbital decay by the atmosphere. 　Satellites can then change or maintain the orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or ion thrusters. 　In 2018, about 90% of satellites orbiting Earth are in low Earth orbit or geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still at the sky. 　Some imaging satellites chose a Sun-synchronous orbit because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting. 　As the number of satellites and space debris around Earth increases, the threat of collision has become more severe. 　A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as the Moon, Mars, and the Sun) or many bodies at once (two for a halo orbit, three for a Lissajous orbit). 　Earth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring the weather, ocean, forest, etc. 　Space telescopes take advantage of outer space's near perfect vacuum to observe objects with the entire electromagnetic spectrum. 　Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once, communications satellites can relay information to remote places. 　The signal delay from satellites and their orbit's predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. 　Space probes are satellites designed for robotic space exploration outside of Earth, and space stations are in essence crewed satellites. 　The first artificial satellite to be launched into the Earth's orbit was the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957.

<font size=3>
A satellite is a subviral agent that depends on the coinfection of a host cell with a helper virus for its replication. 　Satellites can be divided into two major classes: satellite viruses and satellite nucleic acids. 　Satellite viruses, which are most commonly associated with plants, are also found in mammals, arthropods, and bacteria. 　They encode structural proteins to enclose their genetic material, which are therefore distinct from the structural proteins of their helper viruses. 　Satellite nucleic acids, in contrast, do not encode their own structural proteins, but instead are encapsulated by proteins encoded by their helper viruses. 　The genomes of satellites range upward from 359 nucleotides in length for satellite tobacco ringspot virus RNA (STobRV). 　Most viruses have the capability to use host enzymes or their own replication machinery to independently replicate their own viral RNA. 　Satellites, in contrast, are completely dependent on a helper virus for replication. 　The symbiotic relationship between a satellite and a helper virus to catalyze the replication of a satellite genome is also dependent on the host to provide components like replicases to carry out replication. 　A satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage. 　However, the usage of this term remains controversial due to the lack of fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses.

<font size=3>
Heaven, or the heavens, is a common religious cosmological or transcendent supernatural place where beings such as deities, angels, souls, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or reside. 　According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife or, in exceptional cases, enter Heaven alive. 　Heaven is often described as a "highest place", the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the "low places" and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply divine will. 　Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come. 　Another belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world, and the underworld. 　In Indian religions, heaven is considered as Svarga loka, and the soul is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its karma. 　This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves Moksha or Nirvana. 　Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as the otherworld. 　At least in the Abrahamic faiths of Christianity, Islam, and some schools of Judaism, as well as Zoroastrianism, heaven is the realm of Afterlife where good actions in the previous life are rewarded for eternity (hell being the place where bad behavior is punished).

<font size=3>
Dating is a stage of romantic relationships in which two individuals engage in an activity together, most often with the intention of evaluating each other's suitability as a partner in a future intimate relationship. 　It falls into the category of courtship, consisting of social events carried out by the couple either alone or with others. 　The protocols and practices of dating and the terms used to describe it vary vastly between cultures, societies, and time periods. 　Although dating is most often colloquially used to refer to the action of individuals engaging in dates with one other, dating can also encompass a wide range of activities which fall outside participation in social events. 　The meaning of dating also shifted during the 20th century to include a more informal use referring to a romantic, sexual relationship itself beyond an introductory or trial stage. 　Although informal, this meaning is very common and is used in formal speech as well as writing. 　Although taboo across most of the world for much of history, premarital sex has become increasingly common within the last century, beginning with the onset of the sexual revolution. 　Across a greater number of portrayals in film, television, and music, sex within dating has become increasingly accepted as a natural progression of the relationship.

<font size=3>
A weapon, arm or armament is any implement or device that can be used to deter, threaten, inflict physical damage, harm, or kill. 　Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, warfare, or suicide. 　In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target. 　While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many objects are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons. 　Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.

<font size=3>
In biology, weapons are traits that are used by males to fight one another off for access to mates. 　A mate is won in battle either by a male chasing off a fellow competitor or killing it off, usually leaving the victor as the only option for the female to reproduce with. 　However, because stronger organisms, whether mentally or physically, are usually favored in combat, this also leads to the evolution of stronger organisms in species that use combat as a way to secure mates, via intrasexual selection. 　Examples of weapons include: antlers, horns, and ossicones.

<font size=3>
Tennessee (/ˌtɛnɪˈsiː/ (listen) TEN-ih-SEE, locally /ˈtɛnɪsi/ TEN-iss-ee), officially the State of Tennessee, is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States. 　Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and the 15th-most populous of the 50 states. 　It is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest. 　Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee. 　Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. 　Other major cities include Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. 　Tennessee's population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9 million. 　Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains. 　Its name derives from "Tanasi", a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement. 　Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. 　It earned the nickname "The Volunteer State" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service. 　A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment. 　As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war. 　During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. 　This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first atomic bombs. 　After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. 　In 2016, the element tennessine was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Tennessee in its discovery. 　Tennessee has also played a major role in the development of many forms of popular music, including country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel. 　Tennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of Appalachia, the Upland South, and the Deep South. 　The Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the Cumberland Plateau contains many scenic valleys and waterfalls. 　The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. 　The state is twice bisected by the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. 　Its economy is dominated by the health care, music, finance, automotive, chemical, electronics, and tourism sectors, and cattle, soybeans, corn, poultry, and cotton are its primary agricultural products. 　The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation's most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.

Legislation is the process or result of enrolling, enacting, or promulgating laws by a legislature, parliament, or analogous governing body. 　Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as "legislation" while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. 　Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare, or to restrict. 　It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act.

<font size=3>
Anthony or Antony is a masculine given name, derived from the Antonii, a gens (Roman family name) to which Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius) belonged. 　According to Plutarch, the Antonii gens were Heracleidae, being descendants of Anton, a son of Heracles. 　Anthony is an English name that is in use in many countries. 　It has been among the top 100 most popular male baby names in the United States since the late 19th century and has been among the top 100 male baby names between 1998 and 2018 in many countries including Canada, Australia, England, Ireland and Scotland. 　Equivalents include Antonio in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Maltese; Αντώνιος in Greek; António or Antônio in Portuguese; Antoni in Catalan, Polish, and Slovene; Anton in Dutch, Galician, German, Icelandic, Romanian, Russian, and Scandinavian languages; Antoine in French; Antal in Hungarian; and Antun or Ante in Croatian. 　The usual abbreviated form is Tony (sometimes "Tone", "Ant", "Anth" or "Anton"). 　Its use as a Christian name was due to the veneration of St. Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism, particularly in Egypt. 　Also significant was the later cult of St. Anthony of Padua. 　In the United States, it is the 43rd most popular male name as of 2021, according to the Social Security Administration. 　When the background is Italian, Nino or Toni, shortened from Antonino, are used. 　Its popularity in the United Kingdom peaked during the 1940s; in 1944 it was the sixth most popular male name and was still as high as 14th in 1964.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal>Crystal</a> 

<font size=3>
A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. 　In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. 　The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. 　The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification. 　The word crystal derives from the Ancient Greek word κρύσταλλος (krustallos), meaning both "ice" and "rock crystal", from κρύος (kruos), "icy cold, frost". 　Examples of large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt. 　Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. 　Polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. 　A third category of solids is amorphous solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. 　Examples of amorphous solids include glass, wax, and many plastics. 　Despite the name, lead crystal, crystal glass, and related products are not crystals, but rather types of glass, i.e. amorphous solids. 　Crystals, or crystalline solids, are often used in pseudoscientific practices such as crystal therapy, and, along with gemstones, are sometimes associated with spellwork in Wiccan beliefs and related religious movements.

<font size=3>
A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). 　Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). 　Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. 　A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. 　In mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not. 　Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.

<font size=3>
A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. 　Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. 　Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for preparation of food, hunting, manufacture of weapons, and working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts. 　The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. 　Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools. 　The introduction of widespread automation in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor. 　By extension, concepts which support systematic or investigative thought are often referred to as "tools" or as "toolkits".

Pink is the color of a namesake flower that is a pale tint of red. 　It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century. 　According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance. 　A combination of pink and white is associated with chastity and innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction. 　In the 21st century, pink is seen as a symbol of femininity, though this has not always been true; in the 1920s, pink was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.

<font size=3>
James Green aka "Sudden" is a fictional character created by an English author Oliver Strange in the early 1930s as the hero of a series, originally published by George Newnes Books Ltd, set in the American Wild West era. 　Oliver Strange died in 1952, and the series was revived by Frederick H. Christian in the 1960s. 　Christian classified the books as "Piccadilly westerns", that is books written by English authors, simply drawing on the conventions the genre, with no first hand experience of America. 　The Sudden books are among the earliest and best-loved of the type. 　Sudden is portrayed as an intrepid and accurate gunfighter in search of two men who cheated his foster father. 　James Green earns the nickname "Sudden" because of his lightning speed with a gun. 　Sudden is portrayed as a stereotypical gunfighter: an intelligent and resourceful drifting cowboy who is respectful of the law, unwilling to use a gun unless absolutely necessary, humanitarian, brave, strong, and fair. 　The first book was published in 1930 and was followed by 10 more until the 1940s and featured vivid descriptions of the western American landscape, rare in an author at that time. 　The series became popular for its exciting narrations combining elements of mystery, suspense, and action, with engaging characters, in a Wild West setting of dusty towns, ranches, and saloons.

<font size=3>
A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. 　Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. 　Often, computers are used to execute the simulation. 　Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. 　Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. 　Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. 　Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist. 　Key issues in modeling and simulation include the acquisition of valid sources of information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviors used to build the model, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the model, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. 　Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of computer simulation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation>Correlation</a> 

<font size=3>
In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. 　Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. 　Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the height of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase, as it is depicted in the so-called demand curve. 　Correlations are useful because they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice. 　For example, an electrical utility may produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather. 　In this example, there is a causal relationship, because extreme weather causes people to use more electricity for heating or cooling. 　However, in general, the presence of a correlation is not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship (i.e., correlation does not imply causation). 　Formally, random variables are dependent if they do not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence. 　In informal parlance, correlation is synonymous with dependence. 　However, when used in a technical sense, correlation refers to any of several specific types of mathematical operations between the tested variables and their respective expected values. 　Essentially, correlation is the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another. 　There are several correlation coefficients, often denoted ρ {\displaystyle \rho } or r {\displaystyle r} , measuring the degree of correlation. 　The most common of these is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other). 　Other correlation coefficients – such as Spearman's rank correlation – have been developed to be more robust than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships. 　Mutual information can also be applied to measure dependence between two variables.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner>Commissioner</a> 

<font size=3>
A commissioner (commonly abbreviated as Comm'r) is, in principle, a member of a commission or an individual who has been given a commission (official charge or authority to do something). 　In practice, the title of commissioner has evolved to include a variety of senior officials, often sitting on a specific commission. 　In particular, the commissioner frequently refers to senior police or government officials. 　A high commissioner is equivalent to an ambassador, originally between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and now between all Commonwealth states, whether Commonwealth realms, republics or countries having a monarch other than that of the realms. 　The title is sometimes given to senior officials in the private sector; for instance, many North American sports leagues. 　There is some confusion between commissioners and commissaries because other European languages use the same word for both. 　Therefore titles such as commissaire in French, Kommissar in German and comisario in Spanish or commissario in Italian, can mean either commissioner or commissary in English, depending on the context.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard>Howard</a> 

<font size=3>
Howard is an English-language given name originating from Old French Huard (or Houard) from a Germanic source similar to Old High German *Hugihard "heart-brave", or *Hoh-ward, literally "high defender; chief guardian". 　It is also probably in some cases a confusion with the Old Norse cognate Haward (Hávarðr), which means "high guard" and as a surname also with the unrelated Hayward. 　In some rare cases it is from the Old English eowu hierde "ewe herd". 　In Anglo-Norman the French digram -ou- was often rendered as -ow- such as tour → tower, flour (western variant form of fleur) → flower, etc. (with svarabakhti). 　A diminutive is "Howie" and its shortened form is "Ward" (most common in the 19th century). 　Between 1900 and 1960, Howard ranked in the U.S. Top 200; between 1960 and 1990, it ranked in the U.S. Top 400; between 1990 and 2004, it ranked in the U.S. Top 600. 　People with the given name Howard or its variants include:

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete>Concrete</a> 

<font size=3>
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. 　Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. 　Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.　[citation needed] Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $600 billion in revenue by 2025. 　This widespread use results in a number of environmental impacts. 　Most notably, the production process for cement produces large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to net 8% of global emissions. 　Other environmental concerns include widespread illegal sand mining, impacts on the surrounding environment such as increased surface runoff or urban heat island effect, and potential public health implications from toxic ingredients. 　Significant research and development is being done to try to reduce the emissions or make concrete a source of carbon sequestration, and increase recycled and secondary raw materials content into the mix to achieve a circular economy. 　Concrete is expected to be a key material for structures resilient to climate disasters, as well as a solution to mitigate the pollution of other industries, capturing wastes such as coal fly ash or bauxite tailings and residue. 　When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. 　The cement reacts with the water through a process called concrete hydration that hardens over several hours to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses. 　This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms, but also to have a variety of tooled processes preformed. 　The hydration process is exothermic, which means ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set. 　Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, or otherwise change the finished material. 　Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as rebar) embedded to provide tensile strength, yielding reinforced concrete. 　In the past, lime based cement binders, such as lime putty, were often used but sometimes with other hydraulic cements, (water resistant) such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (named for its visual resemblance to Portland stone). 　Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with other methods of binding aggregate together, including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces, and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder. 　Concrete is distinct from mortar. 　Whereas concrete is itself a building material, mortar is a bonding agent that typically holds bricks, tiles and other masonry units together.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore>Singapore</a> 

<font size=3>
Singapore (/ˈsɪŋ(ɡ)əpɔːr/ (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. 　It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. 　The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. 　It has the third highest population density in the world. 　With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. 　English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only in English. 　Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. 　Singapore's history dates back at least a millennium, having been a maritime emporium known as Temasek and subsequently as a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. 　Its contemporary era began in 1819 when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrepôt trading post of the British Empire. 　In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. 　During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942, and returned to British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. 　Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and in 1963 became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. 　Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian "Malaysian Malaysia" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia—at the perceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of Ketuanan Melayu—eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965. 　After early years of turbulence whilst lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalisation, integrating itself within the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign-exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. 　A highly developed country, it is tied at 12th on the UN Human Development Index and has the second-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. 　Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. 　It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub, and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. 　Singapore is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. 　Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world. 　Singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. 　Although the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. 　The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, with 83 out of 104 seats in Parliament as of the 2020 general election. 　One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. 　Singapore is also a member of the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), East Asia Summit (EAS), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the Commonwealth of Nations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland>Maryland</a> 

<font size=3>
Maryland (US: /ˈmɛrɪlənd/ (listen) MERR-il-ənd) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. 　It shares borders with Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. 　With a total land area of 12,407 square miles (32,130 km2), Maryland is the 8th smallest state by land area, but with a population of over 6,177,200, it ranks as the 18th most populous state and the 5th most densely populated. 　Baltimore is the largest city in the state, and the capital is Annapolis. 　Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. 　It is named after Henrietta Maria, the French-born queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, who was known then in England as Mary. 　Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans – mostly by Algonquian peoples and, to a lesser degree, Iroquoian and Siouan. 　As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of England, Maryland was founded by George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England. 　In 1632, Charles I of England granted Lord Baltimore a colonial charter, naming the colony after his wife, Henrietta Maria. 　Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans, who rejected Catholicism in their settlements, Lord Baltimore envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. 　Accordingly, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who "reproached" a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation. 　Nevertheless, religious strife was common in the early years, and Catholics remained a minority, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony. 　Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. 　Its economy was heavily plantation-based and centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. 　Demand for cheap labor from Maryland colonists led to the importation of numerous indentured servants and enslaved Africans. 　In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. 　Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution, and by 1776, its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence. 　Many of its citizens subsequently played key political and military roles in the war. 　In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. Although then a slave state, Maryland remained in the Union during the American Civil War, its strategic location giving it a significant role in the conflict. 　After the Civil War, Maryland took part in the Industrial Revolution, driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. 　Since the 1940s, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. 　As of 2015[update], Maryland had the highest median household income of any state, owing in large part to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, retail services, public administration, real estate, higher education, information technology, defense contracting, health care, and biotechnology. 　Maryland is one of the most multicultural states in the country; it is one of the six states where non-Whites compose a majority of the population, with the fifth-highest percentage of African Americans, and high numbers of residents born in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and South and East Asia. 　The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the highest numbers of historic landmarks per capita. 　Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties, as well as the city of Baltimore, border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries, which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline. 　Although one of the smallest states in the U.S., it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature. 　In a similar vein, Maryland's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 61°N 8°E﻿ / ﻿61°N 8°E﻿ / 61; 8 Norway, officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe, the mainland territory of which comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. 　The remote Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard also form part of Norway. 　Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic, is a dependency of Norway; it also lays claims to the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land. 　The capital and largest city in Norway is Oslo. 　Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and had a population of 5,425,270 in January 2022. 　The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden at a length of 1,619 km (1,006 mi). 　It is bordered by Finland and Russia to the northeast and the Skagerrak strait to the south, on the other side of which are Denmark and the United Kingdom. 　Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. 　The maritime influence dominates Norway's climate, with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts; the interior, while colder, is also significantly milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. 　Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. 　The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country. 　Harald V of the House of Glücksburg is the current King of Norway. 　Jonas Gahr Støre has been prime minister since 2021, replacing Erna Solberg. 　As a unitary sovereign state with a constitutional monarchy, Norway divides state power between the parliament, the cabinet and the supreme court, as determined by the 1814 constitution. 　The kingdom was established in 872 as a merger of many petty kingdoms and has existed continuously for 1,151 years. 　From 1537 to 1814, Norway was a part of the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, and, from 1814 to 1905, it was in a personal union with the Kingdom of Sweden. 　Norway was neutral during the First World War, and also in World War II until April 1940 when the country was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany until the end of the war. 　Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels: counties and municipalities. 　The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and the Finnmark Act. 　Norway maintains close ties with both the European Union and the United States. 　Norway is also a founding member of the United Nations, NATO, the European Free Trade Association, the Council of Europe, the Antarctic Treaty, and the Nordic Council; a member of the European Economic Area, the WTO, and the OECD; and a part of the Schengen Area. 　In addition, the Norwegian languages share mutual intelligibility with Danish and Swedish. 　Norway maintains the Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system, and its values are rooted in egalitarian ideals. 　The Norwegian state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors, having extensive reserves of petroleum, natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, and fresh water. 　The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). 　On a per-capita basis, Norway is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside of the Middle East. 　The country has the fourth-highest per-capita income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists. 　On the CIA's GDP (PPP) per capita list (2015 estimate) which includes autonomous territories and regions, Norway ranks as number eleven. 　It has the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, with a value of US$1 trillion. 　Norway has the second highest Human Development Index ranking in the world, previously holding the top position between 2001 and 2006, and between 2009 and 2019; it also has the second highest inequality-adjusted ranking per 2021. 　Norway ranked first on the World Happiness Report for 2017 and currently ranks first on the OECD Better Life Index, the Index of Public Integrity, the Freedom Index, and the Democracy Index. 　Norway also has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. 　Although the majority of Norway's population is ethnic Norwegian, in the 21st century immigration has accounted for more than half of population growth; in 2021, the five largest minority groups in the country were the descendants of Polish, Lithuanian, Somali, Pakistani, and Swedish immigrants.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick>Brick</a> 

<font size=3>
A brick is a type of block used to build walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. 　Properly, the term brick denotes a block composed of dried clay, but is now also used informally to denote other chemically cured construction blocks. 　Bricks can be joined using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking them. 　Bricks are usually produced at brickworks in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. 　Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. 　Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded clay aggregate. 　Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. 　Air-dried bricks, also known as mud-bricks, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw. 　Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds, collectively known as brickwork, and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile>Mile</a> 

<font size=3>
The mile, sometimes the international mile or statute mile to distinguish it from other miles, is a British imperial unit and United States customary unit of distance; both are based on the older English unit of length equal to 5,280 English feet, or 1,760 yards. 　The statute mile was standardised between the British Commonwealth and the United States by an international agreement in 1959, when it was formally redefined with respect to SI units as exactly 1,609.344 metres. 　With qualifiers, mile is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile, such as the nautical mile (now 1.852 km exactly), the Italian mile (roughly 1.852 km), and the Chinese mile (now 500 m exactly). 　The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 Roman feet but the greater importance of furlongs in Elizabethan-era England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593. 　This form of the mile then spread across the British Empire, some successor states of which continue to employ the mile. 　The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes, but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile (6336/3937 km) continues to see some use, although it was officially phased out in 2022. 　While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units (SI), the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories or have close historical ties with the UK or US.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue>Rescue</a> 

<font size=3>
Look up rescue in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Rescue comprises responsive operations that usually involve the saving of life, or the urgent treatment of injuries after an accident or a dangerous situation. 　Tools used might include search and rescue dogs, mounted search and rescue horses, helicopters, the "jaws of life", and other hydraulic cutting and spreading tools used to extricate individuals from wrecked vehicles. 　Rescue operations are sometimes supported by rescue vehicles operated by rescue squads. 　Rescue is a potent theme in human psychology, both from mortal perils and moral perils, and is often treated in fiction, with the rescue of a damsel in distress being a notable trope. 　Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of "rescue fantasies" by men pursuing "fallen women" in his 1910 work "A Special Type of Choice of Object Made by Men"; Freud's insight into this aspect of male psychology might retain merit, though his proposed Oedipus complex used to frame this concept is no longer in vogue. 　Within the practice of psychoanalysis, the term has taken on the additional sense concerning therapists' desire to 'rescue' their clients. 　Historically, rescue could refer to an act of property seizure in service of an unpaid debt. 　For example, there is record of a countryman living in the vicinity of present-day Wythenshawe being prosecuted in a local court for "making rescue" of a pig which had been seized as a distress for non-payment of money owed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance>Finance</a> 

<font size=3>
Finance is the study and discipline of money, currency and capital assets. 　It is related to, but not synonymous with economics,which is the study of production, distribution, and consumption of money, assets, goods and services (the discipline of financial economics bridges the two). 　Finance activities take place in financial systems at various scopes, thus the field can be roughly divided into personal, corporate, and public finance. 　In a financial system, assets are bought, sold, or traded as financial instruments, such as currencies, loans, bonds, shares, stocks, options, futures, etc. 　Assets can also be banked, invested, and insured to maximize value and minimize loss. 　In practice, risks are always present in any financial action and entities. 　A broad range of subfields within finance exists due to its wide scope. 　Asset, money, risk and investment management aim to maximize value and minimize volatility. 　Financial analysis is the viability, stability, and profitability assessment of an action or entity. 　In some cases, theories in finance can be tested using the scientific method, covered by experimental finance. 　Some fields are multidisciplinary, such as mathematical finance, financial law, financial economics, financial engineering and financial technology. 　These fields are the foundation of business and accounting. 　The early history of finance parallels the early history of money, which is prehistoric. 　Ancient and medieval civilizations incorporated basic functions of finance, such as banking, trading and accounting, into their economies. 　In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed. 　In the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline, separate from economics. 　(The first academic journal, The Journal of Finance, began publication in 1946.) 　The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and 1970s. 　Finance is today also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's level programs.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt>Salt</a> 

<font size=3>
Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in the form of a natural crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. 　Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater. 　The open ocean has about 35 g (1.2 oz) of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%. 　Salt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. 　Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. 　Salting, brining, and pickling are also ancient and important methods of food preservation. 　Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. 　Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. 　Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. 　The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. 　Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance. 　Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. 　The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. 　It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine; it is also used in the manufacturing processes of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. 　Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes of salt, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. 　Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. 　Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. 　As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods. 　Sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. 　Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults. 　Such health effects of salt have long been studied. 　Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. 　The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day.

<font size=3>
Jordan (Arabic: الأردن; tr. Al-ʾUrdunn [al.ʔur.dunː]), officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe, within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. 　Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the northeast, Syria to the north, and the Palestinian West Bank, Israel, and the Dead Sea to the west. 　It has a 26 km (16 mi) coastline in its southwest on the Gulf of Aqaba's Red Sea, which separates Jordan from Egypt. 　Amman is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well as its economic, political, and cultural centre. 　Modern-day Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. 　Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom. 　In the third century BC, the Arab Nabataeans established their Kingdom with Petra as the capital. 　Later rulers of the Transjordan region include the Assyrian, Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abassid, and the Ottoman empires. 　After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Greater Syria region was partitioned by Britain and France. 　The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a British protectorate. 　In 1946, Jordan gained independence and became officially known in Arabic as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 　The country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967. 　Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988, and became the second Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. 　Jordan is a semi-arid country, covering an area of 89,342 km2 (34,495 sq mi), with a population of 10 million, making it the eleventh-most populous Arab country. 　The dominant majority, or around 95% of the country's population, is Sunni Muslim, with a mostly Arab Christian minority. 　Jordan has been mostly unscathed by the violence that swept the region following the Arab Spring in 2010. 　From as early as 1948, Jordan has accepted refugees from multiple neighboring countries in conflict. 　An estimated 2.1 million Palestinian and 1.4 million Syrian refugees are present in Jordan as of a 2015 census; with most Palestinian refugees holding Jordanian citizenship. 　The kingdom is also a refuge to thousands of Christian Iraqis fleeing persecution by the Islamic State. 　While Jordan continues to accept refugees, the recent large influx from Syria placed substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure. 　The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers. 　Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. 　The country has a high Human Development Index, ranking 102nd, and is considered an upper middle income economy. 　The Jordanian economy, one of the smallest economies in the region, is attractive to foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce. 　The country is a major tourist destination, also attracting medical tourism due to its well developed health sector. 　Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees, and regional turmoil have hampered economic growth.

Lambda (/ˈlæmdə/; uppercase Λ, lowercase λ; Greek: λάμ(β)δα, lám(b)da) is the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiced alveolar lateral approximant IPA: [l]. 　In the system of Greek numerals, lambda has a value of 30. 　Lambda is derived from the Phoenician Lamed . 　Lambda gave rise to the Latin L and the Cyrillic El (Л). 　The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as [laːbdaː] (λάβδα) in Classical Greek times. 　In Modern Greek, the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced [ˈlam.ða]. 　In early Greek alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied. 　Most variants consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at their ends. 　The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left ("Western" alphabets) or top ("Eastern" alphabets). 　Other variants had a vertical line with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. 　With the general adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the Romans put the angle at the lower-left. 　The HTML 4 character entity references for the Greek capital and small letter lambda are &#923; and &#955; respectively. 　The Unicode code points for lambda are U+039B and U+03BB.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon>Carbon</a> 

<font size=3>
Carbon (from Latin carbo 'coal') is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. 　It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—its atom making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. 　It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. 　Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth's crust. 　Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. 　Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. 　Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. 　Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. 　It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen. 　The atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. 　Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon and fullerenes. 　The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. 　For example, graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent. 　Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb "γράφειν" which means "to write"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. 　Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. 　Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. 　All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. 　They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen. 　The most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. 　The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. 　Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.

<font size=3>
In the Bible, the word "flesh" is often used simply as a description of the fleshy parts of an animal, including that of human beings, and typically in reference to dietary laws and sacrifice. 　Less often it is used as a metaphor for familial or kinship relations, and (particularly in the Christian tradition) as a metaphor to describe sinful tendencies. 　A related turn of phrase identifies certain sins as "carnal" sins, from Latin caro, carnis, meaning "flesh."

<font size=3>
Flesh is any aggregation of soft tissues of an organism. 　Various multicellular organisms have soft tissues that may be called "flesh". 　In mammals, including humans, flesh encompasses muscles, fats and other loose connective tissues, but sometimes excluding non-muscular organs (liver, lung, spleen, kidney) and typically discarded parts (hard tendon, brain tissue, intestines, etc.). 　In a culinary context, consumable animal flesh is called meat, while processed visceral tissues are known as offal. 　In particular animal groups such as vertebrates, molluscs and arthropods, the flesh is distinguished from tougher body structures such as bone, shell and scute, respectively. 　In plants, the "flesh" is the juicy, edible structures such as the mesocarp of fruits and melons as well as soft tubers, rhizomes and taproots, as opposed to tougher structures like nuts and stems. 　In fungi, flesh refers to trama, the soft, inner portion of a mushroom, or fruit body. 　A more restrictive usage may be found in some contexts, such as the visual arts, where flesh may refer only to visibly exposed human skin, as opposed to parts of the body covered by clothing and hair. 　Flesh as a descriptor for colour usually refers to the non-melanated pale or pinkish skin colour of white humans, however, it can also be used to refer to the colour of any human skin. 　In Christian religious circles, the flesh is a metaphor associated with carnality.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling>Rolling</a> 

<font size=3>
Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding. 　Rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as pure rolling. 　By definition, there is no sliding when there is a frame of reference in which all points of contact on the rolling object have the same velocity as their counterparts on the surface on which the object rolls; in particular, for a frame of reference in which the rolling plane is at rest (see animation), the instantaneous velocity of all the points of contact (e.g., a generating line segment of a cylinder) of the rolling object is zero. 　In practice, due to small deformations near the contact area, some sliding and energy dissipation occurs. 　Nevertheless, the resulting rolling resistance is much lower than sliding friction, and thus, rolling objects, typically require much less energy to be moved than sliding ones. 　As a result, such objects will more easily move, if they experience a force with a component along the surface, for instance gravity on a tilted surface, wind, pushing, pulling, or torque from an engine. 　Unlike cylindrical axially symmetric objects, the rolling motion of a cone is such that while rolling on a flat surface, its center of gravity performs a circular motion, rather than a linear motion. 　Rolling objects are not necessarily axially-symmetrical. 　Two well known non-axially-symmetrical rollers are the Reuleaux triangle and the Meissner bodies. 　The oloid and the sphericon are members of a special family of developable rollers that develop their entire surface when rolling down a flat plane. 　Objects with corners, such as dice, roll by successive rotations about the edge or corner which is in contact with the surface. 　The construction of a specific surface allows even a perfect square wheel to roll with its centroid at constant height above a reference plane.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight>Knight</a> 

<font size=3>
A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state (including the Pope) or representative for service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially in a military capacity. 　Knighthood finds origins in the Greek hippeis and hoplite (ἱππεῖς) and Roman eques and centurion of classical antiquity. 　In the Early Middle Ages in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. 　During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. 　By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. 　Often, a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter or a bodyguard for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. 　The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. 　Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. 　This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry, cavalier and related terms. 　In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Islamic world. 　The Crusades brought various military orders of knights to the forefront of defending Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. 　In the Late Middle Ages, new methods of warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles remained in many countries. 　Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I is often referred to as the "last knight" in this regard. 　The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, relating to the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. 　Today, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches, as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Spanish Order of Santiago, the Protestant Order of Saint John, as well as the English Order of the Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, and the Order of St. Olav. 　There are also dynastic orders like the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Order of the British Empire and the Order of St. George. 　In modern times these are orders centered around charity and civic service, and are no longer military orders. 　Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a head of state, monarch, or prelate to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the British honours system, often for service to the Church or country. 　The modern female equivalent in the English language is Dame. 　Knighthoods and damehoods are traditionally regarded as being one of the most prestigious awards people can obtain.

<font size=3>
Oregon (/ˈɒrɪɡən/ (listen)) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. 　Oregon is a part of the Western United States, with the Columbia River delineating much of Oregon's northern boundary with Washington, while the Snake River delineates much of its eastern boundary with Idaho. 　The 42° north parallel delineates the southern boundary with California and Nevada. 　The western boundary is formed by the Pacific Ocean. 　Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of years. 　The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. 　As early as 1564, the Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. 　In 1592, Juan de Fuca undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the strait now bearing his name. 　The Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, and the first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur trappers and traders. 　In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country, and the Oregon Territory was created in 1848. 　Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859. 　Today, with 4 million people over 98,000 square miles (250,000 km2), Oregon is the ninth largest and 27th most populous U.S. state. 　The capital, Salem, is the second-most populous city in Oregon, with 175,535 residents. 　Portland, with 652,503, ranks as the 26th among U.S. cities. 　The Portland metropolitan area is the 25th largest metro area in the nation, with a population of 2,453,168. 　Oregon is also one of the most geographically diverse states in the U.S., marked by volcanoes, abundant bodies of water, dense evergreen and mixed forests, as well as high deserts and semi-arid shrublands. 　At 11,249 feet (3,429 m), Mount Hood, a stratovolcano, is the state's highest point. 　Oregon's only national park, Crater Lake National Park, comprises the caldera surrounding Crater Lake, the deepest lake in the United States. 　The state is also home to the single largest organism in the world, Armillaria ostoyae, a fungus that runs beneath 2,200 acres (8.9 km2) of the Malheur National Forest. 　Oregon's economy has historically been powered by various forms of agriculture, fishing, logging, and hydroelectric power. 　Oregon is the top lumber producer of the contiguous United States, with the lumber industry dominating the state's economy during the 20th century. 　Technology is another one of Oregon's major economic forces, beginning in the 1970s with the establishment of the Silicon Forest and the expansion of Tektronix and Intel. 　Sportswear company Nike, Inc., headquartered in Beaverton, is the state's largest public corporation with an annual revenue of $30.6 billion.

<font size=3>
Soil, also commonly referred to as earth or dirt, is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that together support life. 　Some scientific definitions distinguish dirt from soil by restricting the former term specifically to displaced soil. 　Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution). 　Accordingly, soil is a three-state system of solids, liquids, and gases. 　Soil is a product of several factors: the influence of climate, relief (elevation, orientation, and slope of terrain), organisms, and the soil's parent materials (original minerals) interacting over time. 　It continually undergoes development by way of numerous physical, chemical and biological processes, which include weathering with associated erosion. 　Given its complexity and strong internal connectedness, soil ecologists regard soil as an ecosystem. 　Most soils have a dry bulk density (density of soil taking into account voids when dry) between 1.1 and 1.6 g/cm3, though the soil particle density is much higher, in the range of 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm3. 　Little of the soil of planet Earth is older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic, although fossilized soils are preserved from as far back as the Archean. 　The pedosphere interfaces with the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. 　Collectively, Earth's body of soil, called the pedosphere, has four important functions: as a medium for plant growth as a means of water storage, supply and purification as a modifier of Earth's atmosphere as a habitat for organisms All of these functions, in their turn, modify the soil and its properties. 　Soil science has two basic branches of study: edaphology and pedology. 　Edaphology studies the influence of soils on living things. 　Pedology focuses on the formation, description (morphology), and classification of soils in their natural environment. 　In engineering terms, soil is included in the broader concept of regolith, which also includes other loose material that lies above the bedrock, as can be found on the Moon and other celestial objects.

<font size=3>
Commerce is the large-scale organized system of activities, functions, procedures and institutions directly and indirectly related to the exchange (buying and selling) of goods and services among two or more parties within local, regional, national or international economies. 　More specifically, commerce is not business, but rather the part of business which facilitates the movement and distribution of finished or unfinished but valuable goods and services from the producers to the end consumers on a large scale, as opposed to the sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing of those goods. 　Commerce is subtly different from trade as well, which is the final transaction, exchange or transfer of finished goods and services between a seller and an end consumer. 　Commerce not only includes trade as defined above, but also a series of transactions that happen between the producer and the seller with the help of the auxiliary services and means which facilitate such trade. 　These auxiliary services include transportation, communication, warehousing, insurance, banking, financial markets, advertising, packaging, the services of commercial agents and agencies, etc. 　In other words, commerce encompasses a wide array of political, economical, technological, logistical, legal, regulatory, social and cultural aspects of trade on a large scale. 　From a marketing perspective, commerce creates time and place utility by making goods and services available to the customers at the right place and at the right time by changing their location or placement. 　Described in this manner, trade is a part of commerce and commerce is a part of business. 　Commerce was a costly endeavor in the antiquities because of the risky nature of transportation, which restricted it to local markets. 　Commerce then expanded along with the improvement of transportation systems over time. 　In the middle ages, long-distance and large-scale commerce was still limited within continents. 　With the advent of the age of exploration and oceangoing ships, commerce took an international, trans-continental stature. 　Currently the reliability of international trans-oceanic shipping and mailing systems and the facility of the Internet has made commerce possible between cities, regions and countries situated anywhere in the world. 　In the 21st century, Internet-based electronic commerce (where financial information is transferred over Internet), and its subcategories such as wireless mobile commerce and social network-based social commerce have been and continue to get adopted widely. 　Legislative bodies and ministries or ministerial departments of commerce regulate, promote and manage domestic and foreign commercial activities within a country. 　International commerce can be regulated by bilateral treaties between countries. 　However, after the second world war and the rise of free trade among nations, multilateral arrangements such as the GATT and later the World Trade Organization became the principal systems regulating global commerce. 　The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is another important organization which sets rules and resolves disputes in international commerce.

A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. 　The wheel is one of the key components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. 　Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. 　Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel, and flywheel. 　Common examples are found in transport applications. 　A wheel reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles. 　In order for wheels to rotate, a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or torque. 　Using the wheel, Sumerians invented a device that spins clay as a potter shapes it into the desired object.

<font size=3>
Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). 　Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 　The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. 　The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. 　Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. 　The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. 　The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages.　[citation needed] The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. 　It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. 　The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. 　Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. 　A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. 　Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport. 　The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open, played on hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay courts; Wimbledon, played on grass courts; and the US Open, also played on hardcourts.

In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. 　Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. 　Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. 　Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings. 　In common language usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. 　In botanical usage, the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called 'fruits' in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument>Argument</a> 

<font size=3>
An argument is a statement or group of statements called premises intended to determine the degree of truth or acceptability of another statement called a conclusion. 　Arguments can be studied from three main perspectives: the logical, the dialectical and the rhetorical perspective. 　In logic, an argument is usually expressed not in natural language but in a symbolic formal language, and it can be defined as any group of propositions of which one is claimed to follow from the others through deductively valid inferences that preserve truth from the premises to the conclusion. 　This logical perspective on argument is relevant for scientific fields such as mathematics and computer science. 　Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments. 　Deductive arguments can be valid, and the valid ones can be sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premises is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premises necessitate a true conclusion. 　Inductive arguments, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability. 　The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example, the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in transcendental arguments, the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting. 　In dialectics, and also in a more colloquial sense, an argument can be conceived as a social and verbal means of trying to resolve, or at least contend with, a conflict or difference of opinion that has arisen or exists between two or more parties. 　For the rhetorical perspective, the argument is constitutively linked with the context, in particular with the time and place in which the argument is located. 　From this perspective, the argument is evaluated not just by two parties (as in a dialectical approach) but also by an audience. 　In both dialectic and rhetoric, arguments are used not through a formal but through natural language. 　Since classical antiquity, philosophers and rhetoricians have developed lists of argument types in which premises and conclusions are connected in informal and defeasible ways.

A legislature is an assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. 　They are often contrasted with the executive and judicial powers of government. 　Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation. 　In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the budget involved. 　The members of a legislature are called legislators. 　In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber.

<font size=3>
In various theistic religious traditions, an angel is a supernatural spiritual being who serves God. 　Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity. 　Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, such as guardian angels, and servants of God. 　Abrahamic religions describe angelic hierarchies, which vary by religion and sect. 　Some angels have specific names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or titles (such as seraph or archangel). 　Those expelled from Heaven are called fallen angels, distinct from the heavenly host. 　Angels in art are usually shaped like humans of extraordinary beauty, though this is not always the case—sometimes, they can be portrayed in a frightening, inhuman manner. 　They are often identified in Christian artwork with bird wings, halos, and divine light.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand>Sand</a> 

<font size=3>
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided mineral particles. 　Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. 　Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt. 　Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass. 　The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz. 　Calcium carbonate is the second most common type of sand, for example, aragonite, which has mostly been created, over the past 500 million years, by various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. 　For example, it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the Caribbean. 　Somewhat more rarely, sand may be composed of calcium sulfate, such as gypsum and selenite, as is found in places like White Sands National Park and Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in the U.S. Sand is a non-renewable resource over human timescales, and sand suitable for making concrete is in high demand. 　Desert sand, although plentiful, is not suitable for concrete. 　50 billion tons of beach sand and fossil sand is used each year for construction.

<font size=3>
A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. 　In other words, a column is a compression member. 　The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. 　A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post. 　Supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. 　For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. 　Other compression members are often termed "columns" because of the similar stress conditions. 　Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. 　In architecture, "column" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. 　A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall. 　A long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour>Honour</a> 

<font size=3>
Honour (Commonwealth English) or honor (American English; see spelling differences) is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal ethos, that manifests itself as a code of conduct, and has various elements such as valour, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. 　It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institutions such as a family, school, regiment or nation. 　Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large. 　Samuel Johnson, in his A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was "nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness". 　This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it. 　On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to "reputation" and "fame"; to "privileges of rank or birth", and as "respect" of the kind which "places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence". 　This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. 　Finally, with respect to sexuality, honour has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) "chastity" or "virginity", or in case of married men and women, "fidelity". 　Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra>Algebra</a> 

<font size=3>
Algebra (from Arabic ‏الجبر‎ (al-jabr) 'reunion of broken parts, bonesetting') is the study of variables and the rules for manipulating these variables in formulas; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. 　Elementary algebra deals with the manipulation of variables (commonly represented by Roman letters) as if they were numbers and is therefore essential in all applications of mathematics. 　Abstract algebra is the name given, mostly in education, to the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. 　Linear algebra, which deals with linear equations and linear mappings, is used for modern presentations of geometry, and has many practical applications (in weather forecasting, for example). 　There are many areas of mathematics that belong to algebra, some having "algebra" in their name, such as commutative algebra, and some not, such as Galois theory. 　The word algebra is not only used for naming an area of mathematics and some subareas; it is also used for naming some sorts of algebraic structures, such as an algebra over a field, commonly called an algebra. 　Sometimes, the same phrase is used for a subarea and its main algebraic structures; for example, Boolean algebra and a Boolean algebra. 　A mathematician specialized in algebra is called an algebraist.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert>Desert</a> 

<font size=3>
A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. 　The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. 　About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. 　This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". 　Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. 　Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. 　Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. 　Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. 　This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. 　Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. 　Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. 　The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. 　Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones, often forming desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place. 　Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. 　Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. 　There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. 　Where these are found, oases can occur. 　Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. 　Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. 　Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. 　Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. 　Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. 　They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. 　Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. 　They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy. 　People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. 　Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. 　The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. 　Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. 　Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. 　Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. 　Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.

In biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. 　This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey. 　Colonies can form in various shapes and ways depending on the organism involved. 　For instance, the bacterial colony is a cluster of identical cells (clones). 　These colonies often form and grow on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell. 　Colonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be modular organisms. 　Unitary organisms have determinate development (set life stages) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct. 　Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within. 　In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony. 　In contrast, solitary organisms do not associate with colonies; they are ones in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce. 　Some organisms are primarily independent and form facultative colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive (obligate). 　For example, some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses (facultative colony), while corals are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the coenosarc) that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity.

In modern parlance, a colony is a territory subject to a form of foreign rule. 　Though dominated by the foreign colonizers, colonies remain separate from the administration of the original country of the colonizers, the metropolitan state (or "mother country"). 　This administrative colonial separation makes colonies neither incorporated territories nor client states. 　Some colonies have been organized either as dependent territories that are not sufficiently self-governed, or as self-governed colonies controlled by colonial settlers. 　The term colony originates from the ancient Roman colonia, a type of Roman settlement. 　Derived from colon-us (farmer, cultivator, planter, or settler), it carries with it the sense of 'farm' and 'landed estate'. 　Furthermore the term was used to refer to the older Greek apoikia (Ancient Greek: ἀποικία, lit. 'home away from home'), which were overseas settlements by ancient Greek city-states. 　The city that founded such a settlement became known as its metropolis ("mother-city"). 　Since early-modern times, historians, administrators, and political scientists have generally used the term "colony" to refer mainly to the many different overseas territories of particularly European states between the 15th and 20th centuries CE, with colonialism and decolonization as corresponding phenomena. 　While colonies often developed from trading outposts or territorial claims, such areas do not need to be a product of colonization, nor become colonially organized territories. 　Some historians use the term informal colony to refer to a country under the de facto control of another state, although this term is often contentious.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence>Confidence</a> 

<font size=3>
Confidence is a state of being clear-headed either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective. 　Confidence comes from a Latin word 'fidere' which means "to trust"; therefore, having self-confidence is having trust in one's self. 　Arrogance or hubris, in comparison, is the state of having unmerited confidence—believing something or someone is correct or capable when evidence or reasons for this belief are lacking. 　Overconfidence or presumptuousness is excessive belief in someone (or something) succeeding, without any regard for failure. 　Confidence can be a self-fulfilling prophecy as those without it may fail or not try because they lack it and those with it may succeed because they have it rather than because of an innate ability. 　The concept of self-confidence is commonly defined as self-assurance in one's personal judgment, ability, power, etc. 　One's self-confidence increases as a result of experiences of having satisfactorily completed particular activities. 　Self-confidence involves a positive belief that in the future, one can generally accomplish what one wishes to do. 　Self-confidence is not the same as self-esteem, which is an evaluation of one's own worth, whereas self-confidence is more specifically trust in one's ability to achieve some goal, which one meta-analysis suggested is similar to generalization of self-efficacy. 　Abraham Maslow and many others after him have emphasized the need to distinguish between self-confidence as a generalized personality characteristic, and self-confidence with respect to a specific task, ability or challenge (i.e. self-efficacy). 　Self-confidence typically refers to general self-confidence. 　This is different from self-efficacy, which psychologist Albert Bandura has defined as a "belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task" and therefore is the term that more accurately refers to specific self-confidence. 　Psychologists have long noted that a person can possess self-confidence in their ability to complete a specific task (self-efficacy) (e.g. cook a good meal or write a good novel) even though they may lack general self-confidence, or conversely be self-confident though they lack the self-efficacy to achieve a particular task (e.g. write a novel). 　These two types of self-confidence are, however, correlated with each other, and for this reason can be easily conflated.

<font size=3>
Steam is a substance containing water in the gas phase,: 7  and sometimes also an aerosol of liquid water droplets, or air. 　This may occur due to evaporation or due to boiling, where heat is applied until water reaches the enthalpy of vaporization. 　Steam that is saturated or superheated is invisible; however, wet steam or water vapor, a visible mist or aerosol of water droplets, is often referred to as "steam".　: 6  Water increases in volume by 1,700 times at standard temperature and pressure; this change in volume can be converted into mechanical work by steam engines such as reciprocating piston type engines and steam turbines, which are a sub-group of steam engines. 　Piston type steam engines played a central role in the Industrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80% of the world's electricity. 　If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its vapor pressure, it can create a steam explosion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender>Gender</a> 

<font size=3>
Look up gender in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Gender includes the social, psychological, cultural and behavioral aspects of being a man, woman, or other gender identity. 　Depending on the context, this may include sex-based social structures (i.e. gender roles) and gender expression. 　Most cultures use a gender binary, in which gender is divided into two categories, and people are considered part of one or the other (boys/men and girls/women); those who are outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. 　Some societies have specific genders besides "man" and "woman", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.). 　Most scholars agree that gender is a central characteristic for social organization. 　Sexologist John Money is often regarded as the first to introduce a terminological distinction between biological sex and gender role (which, as originally defined, includes the concepts of both gender role and what would later become known as gender identity) in 1955 although Madison Bentley had already in 1945 defined gender as the "socialized obverse of sex", and Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 book The Second Sex has been interpreted as the beginning of the distinction between sex and gender in feminist theory, although this interpretation is contested. 　Before Money's work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. 　However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. 　Most contemporary social scientists, behavioral scientists and biologists, many legal systems and government bodies, and intergovernmental agencies such as the WHO, make a distinction between gender and sex. 　In other contexts, the term gender has been used as a synonym for sex without representing a clear conceptual difference. 　For instance, in non-human animal research, gender is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals. 　This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s. 　In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started to use gender instead of sex to avoid confusion with sexual intercourse. 　Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using sex as the biological classification and gender as "a person's self-representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation." 　The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. 　Other sciences, such as sexology and neuroscience, are also interested in the subject. 　The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly do, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in females and males influence the development of gender in humans; both inform the debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity and gendered behavior. 　In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. 　This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on transsexualism in 1978.
