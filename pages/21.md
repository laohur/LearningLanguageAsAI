## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland>Roland</a> 

<font size=3>
Roland (pronounced [ʁɔ.lɑ̃]; Old Frankish: *Hrōþiland; Medieval Latin: Hruodlandus or Rotholandus; Italian: Orlando or Rolando; died 15 August 778) was a Frankish military leader under Charlemagne who became one of the principal figures in the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. 　The historical Roland was military governor of the Breton March, responsible for defending Francia's frontier against the Bretons. 　His only historical attestation is in Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni, which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard killed in retribution by the Basques in Iberia at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. 　The story of Roland's death at Roncevaux Pass was embellished in later medieval and Renaissance literature. 　The first and most famous of these epic treatments was the Old French Chanson de Roland of the 11th century. 　Two masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso (by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto respectively), are even further detached from history than the earlier Chansons, similarly to the later Morgante by Luigi Pulci. 　Roland is poetically associated with his sword Durendal, his horse Veillantif, and his oliphant horn. 　In the late 17th century, French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote an opera titled Roland, based on the story of the title character.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic>Harmonic</a> 

<font size=3>
A harmonic is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency, the frequency of the original periodic signal, such as a sinusoidal wave. 　The original signal is also called the 1st harmonic, the other harmonics are known as higher harmonics. 　As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. 　The set of harmonics forms a harmonic series. 　The term is employed in various disciplines, including music, physics, acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. 　For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. 　An nth characteristic mode, for n > 1, will have nodes that are not vibrating. 　For example, the 3rd characteristic mode will have nodes at 1 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{3}}} L and 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} L, where L is the length of the string. 　In fact, each nth characteristic mode, for n not a multiple of 3, will not have nodes at these points. 　These other characteristic modes will be vibrating at the positions 1 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{3}}} L and 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} L. If the player gently touches one of these positions, then these other characteristic modes will be suppressed. 　The tonal harmonics from these other characteristic modes will then also be suppressed. 　Consequently, the tonal harmonics from the nth characteristic modes, where n is a multiple of 3, will be made relatively more prominent. 　In music, harmonics are used on string instruments and wind instruments as a way of producing sound on the instrument, particularly to play higher notes and, with strings, obtain notes that have a unique sound quality or "tone colour". 　On strings, bowed harmonics have a "glassy", pure tone. 　On stringed instruments, harmonics are played by touching (but not fully pressing down the string) at an exact point on the string while sounding the string (plucking, bowing, etc.); this allows the harmonic to sound, a pitch which is always higher than the fundamental frequency of the string.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain>Fountain</a> 

<font size=3>
A fountain, from the Latin "fons" (genitive "fontis"), meaning source or spring, is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. 　It is also a structure that jets water into the air for a decorative or dramatic effect. 　Fountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. 　Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air. 　In addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. 　Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. 　In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. 　King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature. 　The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them. 　By the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. 　Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. 　The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water 140 metres (460 ft) in the air. 　The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which spouts water 260 metres (850 ft) above the Red Sea. 　Fountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. 　A splash pad or spray pool allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. 　The musical fountain combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects. 　Fountains can themselves also be musical instruments played by obstruction of one or more of their water jets. 　Drinking fountains provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo>Echo</a> 

<font size=3>
In audio signal processing and acoustics, an echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. 　The delay is directly proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener. 　Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and an empty room. 　A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.　[citation needed] The word echo derives from the Greek ἠχώ (ēchō), itself from ἦχος (ēchos), "sound". 　Echo in the Greek folk story is a mountain nymph whose ability to speak was cursed, leaving her able only to repeat the last words spoken to her. 　Some animals use echo for location sensing and navigation, such as cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats in a process known as echolocation. 　Echoes are also the basis of Sonar technology.

In Greek mythology, Echo (/ˈɛkoʊ/; Greek: Ἠχώ, Ēkhō, "echo", from ἦχος (ēchos), "sound") was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron. 　Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth. 　Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mount Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs. 　Echo, by trying to protect Zeus (as he had ordered her to do), endured Hera's wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last words spoken to her. 　So when Echo met Narcissus and fell in love with him, she was unable to tell him how she felt and was forced to watch him as he fell in love with himself.

<font size=3>
Look up currency in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins. 　A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state. 　Under this definition, the British Pound Sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies. 　Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. 　Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance; i.e., legal tender laws may require a particular unit of account for payments to government agencies. 　Other definitions of the term "currency" appear in the respective synonymous articles: banknote, coin, and money. 　This article uses the definition which focuses on the currency systems of countries. 　One can classify currencies into three monetary systems: fiat money, commodity money, and representative money, depending on what guarantees a currency's value (the economy at large vs. the government's physical metal reserves). 　Some currencies function as legal tender in certain jurisdictions, or for specific purposes, such as payment to a government (taxes), or government agencies (fees, fines). 　Others simply get traded for their economic value. 　Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet. 　Whether government-backed digital notes and coins (such as the digital renminbi in China, for example) will be successfully developed and utilized remains dubious. 　Decentralized digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, are different because they are not issued by a government monetary authority; specifically, bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency and leader in terms of market capitalization, has a fixed supply and is therefore ostensibly deflationary. 　Many warnings issued by various countries note the opportunities that cryptocurrencies create for illegal activities such as scams, ransomware, money laundering and terrorism. 　In 2014, the United States IRS issued a statement explaining that virtual currency is treated as property for Federal income-tax purposes, and it provide examples of how long-standing tax principles applicable to transactions involving property apply to virtual currency.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild>Guild</a> 

<font size=3>
A guild (/ɡɪld/ GILD) is an association of artisans and merchants who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular territory. 　The earliest types of guild formed as organizations of tradespeople belonging to a professional association. 　They sometimes depended on grants of letters patent from a monarch or other ruler to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials, but most were regulated by the city government. 　Guild members found guilty of cheating the public would be fined or banned from the guild. 　A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as guild meeting-places. 　Typically the key "privilege" was that only guild members were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. 　There might be controls on minimum or maximum prices, hours of trading, numbers of apprentices, and many other things. 　Critics argued that these rules reduced free competition, but defenders maintained that they protected professional standards. 　An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at Bologna (established in 1088), Oxford (at least since 1096) and Paris (c. 1150); they originated as guilds of students (as at Bologna) or of masters (as at Paris).

<font size=3>
A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. 　In literature, there exist several slightly deviating definitions. 　Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. 　Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.　: 340  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. 　Another point of view is that a breed is consistent enough in type to be logically grouped together and when mated within the group produce the same type. 　When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this ability – known as "breeding true" – is a requirement for a breed. 　Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. 　The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. 　Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, subspecies, botanical variety, even different genera) are referred to as hybrids.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration>Frustration</a> 

<font size=3>
In psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger, annoyance and disappointment. 　Frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. 　There are two types of frustration: internal and external. 　Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling personal goals, desires, instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived deficiencies, such as a lack of confidence or fear of social situations. 　Conflict, such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration or annoyance and can create cognitive dissonance. 　External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time. 　There are multiple ways individuals cope with frustration such as passive–aggressive behavior, anger, or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive. 　This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. 　However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.

Splitting (also called black-and-white thinking or all-or-nothing thinking) is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both perceived positive and negative qualities of something into a cohesive, realistic whole. 　It is a common defense mechanism wherein the individual tends to think in extremes (e.g., an individual's actions and motivations are all good or all bad with no middle ground). 　This kind of dichotomous interpretation is contrasted by an acknowledgement of certain nuances known as "shades of gray". 　Splitting was first described by Ronald Fairbairn in his formulation of object relations theory; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. 　In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor>Sensor</a> 

<font size=3>
A sensor is a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of sensing a physical phenomenon. 　In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. 　Sensors are always used with other electronics. 　Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. 　With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors. 　Analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. 　Their applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. 　There is a wide range of other sensors that measure chemical and physical properties of materials, including optical sensors for refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement, and electro-chemical sensors for monitoring pH of fluids. 　A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much its output changes when the input quantity it measures changes. 　For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, its sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic). 　Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. 　Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. 　Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. 　In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. 　Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance. 　Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety>Anxiety</a> 

<font size=3>
Anxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events. 　Anxiety is different than fear in that the former is defined as the anticipation of a future threat whereas the latter is defined as the emotional response to a real threat. 　It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. 　Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. 　It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one's breath, tightness in the abdominal region, nausea, and problems in concentration. 　Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat (fight or flight response); anxiety involves the expectation of future threat including dread. 　People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. 　The emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time-periods in response to specific events, and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder). 　The difference between anxiety disorder (as mental disorder) and anxiety (as normal emotion), is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety most of the days during approximately 6 months, or even during shorter time-periods in children. 　Anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades. 　Besides, strong percepts of anxiety exist within other mental disorders, e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_(pathology)>Corn (pathology)</a> 

<font size=3>
A corn or clavus (plural clavi or clavuses) is a cone-shaped and often painful inwardly directed callus of dead skin that forms at a pressure point near a bone, or on a weight-bearing part of the body. 　When on the feet, corns can be so painful as to interfere with walking. 　The visible portion of the corn tends to be more-or-less round, but corns are defined by having a hard tapering root that is directed inward, and pressure on the corn pushes this root deeper into the flesh. 　(Thus the Latin term clavus 'nail'.) 　Pressure corns usually occur on thin or glabrous (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces, especially on the dorsal surface of toes or fingers, but corns triggered by an acute injury (such as a thorn) may occur on the thicker skin of the palms or bottom of the feet (palmar corns and plantar corns). 　Pressure corns form when chronic pressure on the skin against an underlying bone traces a usually elliptical path during the rubbing motion. 　The corn forms at the center of the pressure point and gradually widens and deepens. 　Corns from an acute injury, such as a from a thorn in the sole of the foot, may form due to the weight of the body, when the process that creates the usually evenly developing plantar callus is concentrated at the point of the healing injury, as an internal callus may be triggered by pressure on the transitional scar tissue. 　Once formed, the corn itself becomes the pressure point that generates the callus. 　Plantar corns are superficially similar to plantar warts, but the cause and treatment are very different.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn>Corn</a> 

<font size=3>
Corn is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. 　The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences (or "tassels") and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits. 　The term corn is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage as a common name because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike maize, which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. 　Corn has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of corn surpassing that of wheat or rice. 　In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), corn is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other corn products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. 　The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. 　Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as feedstocks for the chemical industry. 　Corn is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels. 　Corn is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of corn is produced each year than any other grain. 　In 2021, total world production was 1.2 billion tonnes. 　Corn is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas, with 384 million metric tons grown in the United States alone in 2021.[citation needed] Genetically modified corn made up 85% of the corn planted in the United States in 2009. 　Subsidies in the United States help to account for its high level of cultivation of corn and its position as the largest producer in the world.

<font size=3>
Grief is the response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or some living thing that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. 　Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. 　While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, while grief is the reaction to that loss. 　The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. 　Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract; physical loss is related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are more abstract, possibly relating to aspects of a person's social interactions.

<font size=3>
A continent is any of several large geographical regions. 　Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, it could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of Asia or Europe. 　Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. 　Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. 　In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. 　Different variations with fewer continents merge some of these regions, examples of this are merging North America and South America into America, Asia and Europe into Eurasia, and Africa, Asia, and Europe into Afro-Eurasia. 　Oceanic islands are frequently grouped with a nearby continent to divide all the world's land into geographical regions. 　Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form the geographical region Oceania. 　In geology, a continent is defined as "one of Earth's major landmasses, including both dry land and continental shelves". 　The geological continents correspond to seven large areas of continental crust that are found on the tectonic plates, but exclude small continental fragments such as Madagascar that are generally referred to as microcontinents. 　Continental crust is only known to exist on Earth. 　The idea of continental drift gained recognition in the 20th century. 　It postulates that the current continents formed from the breaking up of a supercontinent (Pangaea) that formed hundreds of millions of years ago.

This article contains special characters. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols. 　Apollo is one of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. 　The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. 　One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. 　Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods.　[citation needed] Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu. 　As the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. 　Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the "averter of evil". 　Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. 　Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows. 　The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. 　Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows. 　Apollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. 　As a protector of the young (kourotrophos), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. 　He presided over their passage into adulthood. 　Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo. 　Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. 　Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. 　On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. 　He is associated with dominion over colonists. 　He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city. 　As the god of mousike, Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. 　He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. 　The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. 　In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, the personification of the Sun. 　In Latin texts, however, there was no conflation of Apollo with Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE. 　Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

Battles of Napoleon Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. 　He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. 　Napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures to this day, as a highly celebrated and controversial leader. 　He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. 　His wars and campaigns are studied by militaries all over the world. 　Between three and six million civilians and soldiers perished in what became known as the Napoleonic Wars. 　Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica, not long after its annexation by France, to a native family descending from minor Italian nobility. 　He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. 　He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. 　In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. 　Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. 　He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. 　Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. 　Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. 　In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. 　Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. 　Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram. 　Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. 　The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. 　Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. 　The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Armée. 　In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. 　The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. 　He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. 　In France, the Bourbons were restored to power. 　Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France. 　The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. 　The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. 　Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland and parts of modern Italy and Germany. 　He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.

<font size=3>
An inspection is, most generally, an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. 　In engineering activities inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity. 　The results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets, often with a Standard Inspection Procedure in place to ensure consistent checking. 　Inspections are usually non-destructive. 　Inspections may be a visual inspection or involve sensing technologies such as ultrasonic testing, accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a remote visual inspection, and manually or automatically such as an automated optical inspection. 　Non-contact optical measurement and photogrammetry have become common NDT methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation. 　A 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crerar Review) defined inspection of public services as "... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users." 　A surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection. 　Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. 　If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes. 　This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. 　A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. 　It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process.　: 28

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon>Cannon</a> 

<font size=3>
A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, which usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant. 　Gunpowder ("black powder") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century. 　Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. 　A cannon is a type of heavy artillery weapon. 　The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed. 　In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen into decline, replaced by guns or artillery, if not a more specific term such as howitzer or mortar, except for high-caliber automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called autocannons. 　The earliest known depiction of cannons appeared in Song dynasty China as early as the 12th century; however, solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannons do not appear until the 13th century. 　In 1288 Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannon in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period. 　By the early 14th century, possible mentions of cannon had appeared in the Middle East and the depiction of one in Europe by 1326. 　Recorded usage of cannon began appearing almost immediately after. 　They subsequently spread to India, their usage on the subcontinent being first attested to in 1366. 　By the end of the 14th century, cannons were widespread throughout Eurasia. 　Cannons were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374, when large cannons were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe. 　Cannons featured prominently as siege weapons, and ever larger pieces appeared. 　In 1464 a 16,000 kg (35,000 lb) cannon known as the Great Turkish Bombard was created in the Ottoman Empire. 　Cannons as field artillery became more important after 1453, with the introduction of limber, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility. 　European cannons reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient "classic form" around 1480. 　This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.

<font size=3>
Limestone (calcium carbonate CaCO3) is a type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. 　It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of CaCO3. 　Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. 　This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years. 　Limestone often contains fossils which provide scientists with information on ancient environments and on the evolution of life. 　About 20% to 25% of sedimentary rock is carbonate rock, and most of this is limestone. 　The remaining carbonate rock is mostly dolomite, a closely related rock, which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. 　Magnesian limestone is an obsolete and poorly-defined term used variously for dolomite, for limestone containing significant dolomite (dolomitic limestone), or for any other limestone containing a significant percentage of magnesium. 　Most limestone was formed in shallow marine environments, such as continental shelves or platforms, though smaller amounts were formed in many other environments. 　Much dolomite is secondary dolomite, formed by chemical alteration of limestone. 　Limestone is exposed over large regions of the Earth's surface, and because limestone is slightly soluble in rainwater, these exposures often are eroded to become karst landscapes. 　Most cave systems are found in limestone bedrock. 　Limestone has numerous uses: as a chemical feedstock for the production of lime used for cement (an essential component of concrete), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as toothpaste or paints, as a soil conditioner, and as a popular decorative addition to rock gardens. 　Limestone formations contain about 30% of the world's petroleum reservoirs.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony>Harmony</a> 

<font size=3>
In music, harmony is the process by which individual sounds are joined together or composed into whole units or compositions. 　Often, the term harmony refers to simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords. 　However, harmony is generally understood to involve both vertical harmony (chords) and horizontal harmony (melody). 　Harmony is a perceptual property of music, and, along with melody, one of the building blocks of Western music. 　Its perception is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times throughout Western music. 　In a physiological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. 　Consonant pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough. 　The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. 　Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are therefore sometimes distinguished from harmony. 　In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. 　In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". 　A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. 　Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. 　Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. 　Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. 　Dissonance is an important part of harmony when dissonance can be resolved and contribute to the composition of music as a whole. 　A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol>Pistol</a> 

<font size=3>
A pistol is a handgun, more specifically one with the chamber integral to its gun barrel, though in common usage the two terms are often used interchangeably. 　The English word was introduced in c. 　1570, when early handguns were produced in Europe, and is derived from the Middle French pistolet (c. 1550), meaning a small gun or knife. 　In colloquial usage, the word "pistol" is often used to describe any type of handgun, inclusive of revolvers (which have a single barrel and a separate cylinder housing multiple chambers) and the pocket-sized derringers (which are often multi-barrelled). 　The most common type of pistol used in the contemporary era is the semi-automatic pistol, while the older single-shot and manual repeating pistols are now rarely seen and used primarily for nostalgic hunting and historical reenactment, and the fully automatic machine pistols are uncommon in civilian usage due to generally poor recoil-controllability and strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale.

<font size=3>
In mathematics, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). 　Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. 　For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. 　The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. 　The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. 　For this reason, the derivative is often described as the "instantaneous rate of change", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. 　Derivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. 　In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. 　The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. 　It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. 　For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector. 　The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. 　The reverse process is called antidifferentiation. 　The fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration. 　Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.

<font size=3>
Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior". 　The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology. 　Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. 　As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory. 　Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are: Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined; Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action; Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer>Hammer</a> 

<font size=3>
A hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted "head" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object. 　This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. 　Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. 　Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong). 　Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. 　Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc—downward to add kinetic energy to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). 　War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. 　Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. 　Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip. 　The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic. 　Ubiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a "claw" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. 　Other types of hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. 　Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. 　Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. 　There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses. 　For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. 　Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. 　Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. 　Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. 　A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. 　Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft. 　The high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil. 　In terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. 　For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. 　It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids.

Insight is the understanding of a specific cause and effect within a particular context. 　The term insight can have several related meanings: a piece of information the act or result of understanding the inner nature of things or of seeing intuitively (called noesis in Greek) an introspection the power of acute observation and deduction, discernment, and perception, called intellection or noesis An understanding of cause and effect based on the identification of relationships and behaviors within a model, context, or scenario (see artificial intelligence) An insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the German word Aha-Erlebnis. 　The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical linguist Karl Bühler. 　It is also known as an epiphany, eureka moment or (for cross word solvers) the penny dropping moment (PDM). 　Sudden sickening realisations often identify a problem rather than solving it, so Uh-oh rather than Aha moments are further seen in negative insight. 　A further example of negative insight is chagrin which is annoyance at the obviousness of a solution missed up until the point of insight, an example of this being the Homer Simpson's catchphrase exclamation, D'oh!　.

In modern medicine, a surgeon is a medical professional who performs surgery. 　Although there are different traditions in different times and places, a modern surgeon usually is also a licensed physician or received the same medical training as physicians before specializing in surgery. 　There are also surgeons in podiatry, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. 　It is estimated that surgeons perform over 300 million surgical procedures globally each year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy>Hierarchy</a> 

<font size=3>
A hierarchy (from Greek: ἱεραρχία, hierarkhia, 'rule of a high priest', from hierarkhes, 'president of sacred rites') is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) that are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. 　Hierarchy is an important concept in a wide variety of fields, such as architecture, philosophy, design, mathematics, computer science, organizational theory, systems theory, systematic biology, and the social sciences (especially political philosophy). 　A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. 　The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. 　Hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path. 　All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. 　This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. 　Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. 　Heterarchy is one such form.

<font size=3>
Santiago (/ˌsæntiˈɑːɡoʊ/, US also /ˌsɑːn-/; Spanish: [sanˈtjaɣo]), also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and largest city of Chile and one of the largest cities in the Americas. 　It is located in the country's central valley and is the center of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 8 million, representing nearly 40% of Chile's total population. 　Most of the city is situated between 500–650 m (1,640–2,133 ft) above sea level. 　Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has served as the capital city of Chile since colonial times. 　The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets featuring a mix of art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. 　Santiago's cityscape is defined by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, which is lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. 　The Andes Mountains can be seen from most parts of the city and contribute to a smog problem, particularly during winter, due to the lack of rain. 　The outskirts of the city are surrounded by vineyards, and Santiago is within an hour's drive of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 　Santiago is the political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. 　The Chilean executive and judiciary branches are based in Santiago, while the Congress mostly meets in nearby Valparaíso.

Vegetation is an assemblage of plant species and the ground cover they provide. 　It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. 　It is broader than the term flora which refers to species composition. 　Perhaps the closest synonym is plant community, but vegetation can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. 　Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are encompassed by the term vegetation. 　The vegetation type is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality. 　The contemporary use of vegetation approximates that of ecologist Frederic Clements' term earth cover, an expression still used by the Bureau of Land Management.

<font size=3>
A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic energy. 　Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. 　In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis. 　When a pump contains two or more pump mechanisms with fluid being directed to flow through them in series, it is called a multi-stage pump. 　Terms such as two-stage or double-stage may be used to specifically describe the number of stages. 　A pump that does not fit this description is simply a single-stage pump in contrast. 　In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing>Editing</a> 

<font size=3>
Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, photographic, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information. 　The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organisation, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work. 　The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. 　Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods. 　There are various editorial positions in publishing. 　Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. 　Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. 　The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap. 　The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. 　A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. 　Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. 　In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor. 　In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). 　Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an acquisitions editor or a commissioning editor in a publishing house. 　Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor. 　Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style. 　Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors. 　At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. 　In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. 　At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor. 　They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. 　These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.

<font size=3>
A fossil (from Classical Latin fossilis, lit. 'obtained by digging') is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. 　Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. 　The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record. 　Paleontology is the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. 　Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. 　The oldest fossils are around 3.48 billion years old to 4.1 billion years old. 　The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. 　The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host. 　There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration. 　Fossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1 µm) bacteria to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. 　A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. 　Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). 　These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils, as opposed to body fossils. 　Some fossils are biochemical and are called chemofossils or biosignatures.

<font size=3>
A chronicle (Latin: chronica, from Greek χρονικά chroniká, from χρόνος, chrónos – "time") is a historical account of events arranged in chronological order, as in a timeline. 　Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. 　A chronicle which traces world history is a universal chronicle. 　This is in contrast to a narrative or history, in which an author chooses events to interpret and analyze and excludes those the author does not consider important or relevant. 　The information sources for chronicles vary. 　Some are written from the chronicler's direct knowledge, others from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. 　Some used written material, such as charters, letters, and earlier chronicles. 　Still others are tales of unknown origin that have mythical status. 　Copyists also changed chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original chronicler. 　Determining the reliability of particular chronicles is important to historians. 　Many newspapers and other periodical literature have adopted "chronicle" as part of their name. 　Various fictional stories have also adopted "chronicle" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories.

<font size=3>
Westminster is a city and area of Central London, England, within the larger City of Westminster, most notable for being the seat of the majority of government institutions in the United Kingdom. 　The area, which extends from the River Thames to Oxford Street, has many visitor attractions and historic landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and much of the West End shopping and entertainment district. 　The name (Old English: Westmynstre) originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter's (Westminster Abbey), west of the City of London (until the English Reformation there was also an Eastminster, near the Tower of London, in the East End of London). 　The abbey's origins date from between the 7th and 10th centuries, but it rose to national prominence when rebuilt by Edward the Confessor in the 11th. 　Westminster has been the home of England's government since about 1200, and from 1707 the Government of the United Kingdom. 　In 1539, it became a city. 　Westminster is often used as a metonym to refer to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in the Palace of Westminster.

An expense is an item requiring an outflow of money, or any form of fortune in general, to another person or group as payment for an item, service, or other category of costs. 　For a tenant, rent is an expense. 　For students or parents, tuition is an expense. 　Buying food, clothing, furniture, or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. 　An expense is a cost that is "paid" or "remitted", usually in exchange for something of value. 　Something that seems to cost a great deal is "expensive". 　Something that seems to cost little is "inexpensive". 　"Expenses of the table" are expenses for dining, refreshments, a feast, etc. 　In accounting, expense is any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. 　This outflow is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. 　Technically, an expense is an event in which a proprietary stake is diminished or exhausted, or a liability is incurred. 　In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners' equity. 　The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as: ...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants. 　Expense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.

<font size=3>
A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or trike (if three-wheeled)) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat. 　Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. 　Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. 　The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. 　In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle. 　Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. 　In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period. 　In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. 　In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. 　Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.　[citation needed] According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.

Costume is the distinctive style of dress or cosmetic of an individual or group that reflects class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. 　In short costume is a cultural visual of the people. 　The term also was traditionally used to describe typical appropriate clothing for certain activities, such as riding costume, swimming costume, dance costume, and evening costume. 　Appropriate and acceptable costume is subject to changes in fashion and local cultural norms. 　"But sable is worn more in carriages, lined with real lace over ivory satin, and worn over some smart costume suitable for an afternoon reception." 　A Woman's Letter from London (23 November 1899). 　This general usage has gradually been replaced by the terms "dress", "attire", "robes" or "wear" and usage of "costume" has become more limited to unusual or out-of-date clothing and to attire intended to evoke a change in identity, such as theatrical, Halloween, and mascot costumes. 　Before the advent of ready-to-wear apparel, clothing was made by hand. 　When made for commercial sale it was made, as late as the beginning of the 20th century, by "costumiers", often women who ran businesses that met the demand for complicated or intimate female costume, including millinery and corsetry.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation>Inflation</a> 

<font size=3>
In economics, inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy. 　When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. 　The opposite of inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. 　The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index. 　As prices faced by households do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose. 　The employment cost index is also used for wages in the United States. 　Most economists agree that high levels of inflation as well as hyperinflation—which have severely disruptive effects on the real economy—are caused by persistent excessive growth in the money supply. 　Views on low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied. 　Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services, or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities. 　Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. 　The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. 　Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation. 　Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. 　Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy, while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. 　The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. 　Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, by carrying out open market operations and (more rarely) changing commercial bank reserve requirements.

<font size=3>
In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. 　The inflationary epoch is believed to have lasted from 10−36 seconds after the conjectured Big Bang singularity to some time between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the singularity. 　Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. 　The acceleration of this expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old (5.4 billion years ago). 　Inflation theory was developed in the late 1970s and early 80s, with notable contributions by several theoretical physicists, including Alexei Starobinsky at Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Alan Guth at Cornell University, and Andrei Linde at Lebedev Physical Institute. 　Alexei Starobinsky, Alan Guth, and Andrei Linde won the 2014 Kavli Prize "for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation". 　It was developed further in the early 1980s. 　It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. 　Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the Universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation). 　Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed. 　The detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is unknown. 　The basic inflationary paradigm is accepted by most physicists, as a number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation; however, a substantial minority of scientists dissent from this position. 　The hypothetical field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton. 　In 2002 three of the original architects of the theory were recognized for their major contributions; physicists Alan Guth of M.I.T., Andrei Linde of Stanford, and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton shared the prestigious Dirac Prize "for development of the concept of inflation in cosmology". 　In 2012 Guth and Linde were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their invention and development of inflationary cosmology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration>Acceleration</a> 

<font size=3>
In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. 　Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). 　The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object. 　The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law, is the combined effect of two causes: the net balance of all external forces acting onto that object — magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force; that object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made — magnitude is inversely proportional to the object's mass. 　The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m⋅s−2, m s 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {\tfrac {m}{s^{2}}} } ). 　For example, when a vehicle starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. 　If the vehicle turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector. 　The acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called a linear (or tangential during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. 　When changing direction, the effecting acceleration is called radial (or centripetal during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers experience as a centrifugal force. 　If the speed of the vehicle decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction and mathematically a negative, sometimes called deceleration or retardation, and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward. 　Such negative accelerations are often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft. 　Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same, as they are both changes in velocity. 　Each of these accelerations (tangential, radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their relative (differential) velocity are neutralized in reference to the acceleration due to change in speed.

Sovereign is a title that can be applied to the highest leader in various categories. 　The word is borrowed from Old French souverain, which is ultimately derived from the Latin superānus, meaning 'above'. 　The roles of a sovereign vary from monarch, ruler or head of state to head of municipal government or head of a chivalric order. 　As a result, the word sovereignty has more recently also come to mean independence or autonomy.

<font size=3>
Enzymes (/ˈɛnzaɪmz/) are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. 　The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. 　Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.　: 8.1  Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. 　The study of enzymes is called enzymology and the field of pseudoenzyme analysis recognizes that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties. 　Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. 　Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules, called ribozymes. 　Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures. 　Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. 　Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. 　An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. 　Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. 　Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. 　Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. 　Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. 　An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH, and many enzymes are (permanently) denatured when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties. 　Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. 　Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.

A neighbourhood (British English, Irish English, Australian English and Canadian English) or neighborhood (American English; see spelling differences) is a geographically localised community within a larger city, town, suburb or rural area, sometimes consisting of a single street and the buildings lining it. 　Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to-face interaction among members. 　Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: "Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks. Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur—the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control."[clarification needed]

Punjab (/pʌnˈdʒɑːb, -ˈdʒæb, ˈpʌn-/; Gurmukhi: ਪੰਜਾਬ; Shahmukhi: پنجاب; Punjabi: [pənˈdʒaːb] (listen); also romanised as Panjāb or Panj-Āb) is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, on the Indus Plain comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. 　Punjab's major cities are Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Sialkot, Chandigarh, Shimla, Jalandhar, Gurugram, and Bahawalpur. 　Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE, and had numerous migrations by the Indo-Aryan peoples. 　Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership. 　The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan." 　The Punjab is also accredited for the establishment of many major dynasties and empires, for example the Hindu Shahis, accredited for the defeat of the Saffarid dynasty and the Samanid Empire.　[page needed] The Sikh Empire with the defeat of the Kashmiris and the Durrani Empire. 　The Mauryan empire with conquering South Asia. 　The Tomara dynasty and Katoch Dynasty who resisted multiple invasion attempts from the Ghaznavids and Ghorids. 　The Vardhana empire who conquered the Alchon Huns and North India. 　The Punjab is also responsible for the Tughlaq and Sayyid empires which formed two of the Delhi sultanate dynasties. 　The Eastern Punjab republics in Ancient Punjab (Yaudheya, Trigarta, Arjunayanas, Audumbaras) are also accredited for the establishment of the Mauryan empire and the defeat of many foreign forces that entered Punjab, for example the Indo-Greek Kingdom and the Kushan Empire. 　The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term "Punjab" has changed over time. 　In the 16th century Mughal Empire the Punjab was split into the Lahore Subah which consisted of Punjab up to Jallandhar with jammu in its boundaries and the Delhi subah which comprised the area east of Jallandhar up to western UP(visit: Subah). 　In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani regions of Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory. 　It bordered the Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa regions to the west, Kashmir to the north, the Hindi Belt to the east, and Rajasthan and Sindh to the south. 　The predominant ethnolinguistic group of the Punjab region are the Punjabi people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Punjabi language. 　Punjabi Muslims are the majority in West Punjab (Pakistan), while Punjabi Sikhs are the majority in East Punjab (India). 　Other religious groups are Christianity, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Ravidassia.

Amber is fossilized tree resin that has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times. 　Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects. 　Amber is used in jewelry and has been used as a healing agent in folk medicine. 　There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. 　Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. 　Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion>Abortion</a> 

<font size=3>
Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. 　An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies. 　When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". 　The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. 　The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world. 　Reasons include maternal health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young, wishing to complete education or advance a career, and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest. 　When properly done, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine.　: 1  In the United States, the risk of maternal mortality is 14 times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth. 　Unsafe abortions—those performed by people lacking the necessary skills, or in inadequately resourced settings—are responsible for between 5-13% of maternal deaths, especially in the developing world, though self-managed medication abortions are highly effective and safe. 　Public health data shows that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. 　Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. 　The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. 　The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. 　Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. 　When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. 　In contrast, unsafe abortions performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. 　The World Health Organization states that "access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health". 　Around 73 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. 　Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. 　As of 2018[update], 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. 　Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. 　Abortion rates are similar between countries that restrict abortion and countries that broadly allow it, though this is partly because countries which restrict abortion tend to have higher unintended pregnancy rates. 　Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods. 　Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. 　In some areas, abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, fetal defects, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. 　There is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. 　Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder. 　Those who support the legality of abortion often argue that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. 　Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.

The elbow is the region between the arm and the forearm that surrounds the elbow joint. 　The elbow includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon, the cubital fossa (also called the chelidon, or the elbow pit), and the lateral and the medial epicondyles of the humerus. 　The elbow joint is a hinge joint between the arm and the forearm; more specifically between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved towards and away from the body. 　The term elbow is specifically used for humans and other primates, and in other vertebrates forelimb plus joint is used. 　The name for the elbow in Latin is cubitus, and so the word cubital is used in some elbow-related terms, as in cubital nodes for example.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_(geology)>Drift (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In geology, drift is a name for all sediment (clay, silt, sand, gravel, boulders) transported by a glacier and deposited directly by or from the ice, or by glacial meltwater. 　Drift is often subdivided into (unsorted and) unstratified drift (glacial till) that forms moraines and stratified drift (glaciolacustrine and fluvioglacial sediments) that accumulates as stratified and sorted sediments in the form of outwash plains, eskers, kames, varves, and so forth. 　The term drift clay is a synonym for boulder clay. 　Both are archaic terms for glacial tills with a fine-grained matrix. 　In the United Kingdom, drift is also applied as a general term for all surficial, unconsolidated, rock debris and sediment that is moved from one place to accumulate in another and mapped separately or otherwise diffrerentiated from underlying bedrock. 　In this usage, drift includes a wide variety of deposits, e.g. loess, glacial till, river deposits, colluvium, and so forth, of Quaternary age. 　However, this term is most commonly used to specifically describe glacial deposits.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica>Jamaica</a> 

<font size=3>
Jamaica (/dʒəˈmeɪkə/ (listen); Jamaican Patois: Jumieka) is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. 　Spanning 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, it is the third largest island — after Cuba and Hispaniola — of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean. 　Jamaica lies about 145 km (90 mi) south of Cuba, and 191 km (119 mi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic); the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 km (134 mi) to the north-west. 　Originally inhabited by the indigenous Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. 　Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. 　The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it, renaming it Jamaica. 　Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. 　The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. 　Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations. 　The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962. 　With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. 　Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. 　The majority of Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities. 　Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 　The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the Rastafari religion, reggae music (and associated genres such as dub, ska and dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably cricket, sprinting and athletics. 　Jamaica is often considered the world's least populous cultural superpower. 　Jamaica is an upper-middle income country with an economy heavily dependent on tourism; it has an average of 4.3 million tourists a year. 　Jamaica performs favourably in measurements of press freedom and democratic governance. 　It ranked first in the Caribbean on the World Happiness Report for 2021. 　Politically it is a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as its king. 　His appointed representative in the country is the Governor-General of Jamaica, an office held by Patrick Allen since 2009. 　Andrew Holness has served as Prime Minister of Jamaica since March 2016. 　Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with legislative power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint>Complaint</a> 

<font size=3>
In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief). 　For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. 　Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. 　In Civil Law, a “complaint” is the first formal action taken to officially begin a lawsuit. 　This written document contains the allegations against the defense, the specific laws violated, the facts that led to the dispute, and any demands made by the plaintiff to restore justice. 　In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. 　Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions, such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in Commonwealth realms). 　In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. 　In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a grand jury is referred to as an indictment.

Joshua (/ˈdʒɒʃuə/) also known as Yehoshua (Hebrew: יְהוֹשֻׁעַ‎ Yəhōšuaʿ,‍ Tiberian: Yŏhōšuaʿ, lit. 'Yahweh is salvation') or Josue, functioned as Moses' assistant in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and later succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelite tribes in the Book of Joshua of the Hebrew Bible. 　His name was Hoshea (הוֹשֵׁעַ‎ Hōšēaʿ,‍ lit. 'Save') the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, but Moses called him "Yehoshua" (translated as "Joshua" in English), the name by which he is commonly known in English. 　According to the Bible, he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus. 　The Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. 　In Numbers 13:1, and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes. 　According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age. 　According to Joshua 24:29, Joshua died at the age of 110. 　Joshua holds a position of respect among Muslims. 　Muslims also see Joshua as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses. 　In Islam, it is also believed that Yusha bin Nun (Joshua) was the "attendant" of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr. 　Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.

Trevor (Trefor in the Welsh language) is a common given name or surname of Welsh origin. 　It is an habitational name, deriving from the Welsh tre(f), meaning "homestead", or "settlement" and fawr, meaning "large, big". 　The Cornish language equivalent is Trevorrow and is most associated with Ludgvan. 　Trevor is also a reduced Anglicized form of the Gaelic Ó Treabhair (descendant of Treabhar), which may derive from the original Welsh name.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism>Terrorism</a> 

<font size=3>
Terrorism, in its broadest sense, is the use of criminal violence to provoke a state of terror or fear, mostly with the intention to achieve political or religious aims. 　The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). 　The terms "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Basque conflict, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. 　The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States. 　There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it. 　Terrorism is a charged term. 　It is often used with the connotation of something that is "morally wrong". 　Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. 　Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. 　These include left-wing and right-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. 　Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states. 　State terrorism is that perpetrated by nation states, but is not considered such by the state conducting it, making legality a grey area. 　There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime. 　The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.

<font size=3>
Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented. 　Propaganda can be found in news and journalism, government, advertising, entertainment, education, and activism and is often associated with material which is prepared by governments as part of war efforts, political campaigns, health campaigns, revolutionaries, big businesses, ultra-religious organizations, the media, and certain individuals such as soapboxers. 　In the 20th century, the English term propaganda was often associated with a manipulative approach, but historically, propaganda has been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies. 　Equivalent non-English terms have also largely retained the original neutral connotation.　[citation needed] A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. 　More recently, the digital age has given rise to new ways of disseminating propaganda, for example, bots and algorithms are currently being used to create computational propaganda and fake or biased news and spread it on social media.

<font size=3>
Bacteria (/bækˈtɪəriə/ (listen); singular: bacterium) are ubiquitous, mostly free-living organisms often consisting of one biological cell. 　They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. 　Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. 　Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth's crust. 　Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. 　The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. 　In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. 　Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. 　Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory. 　The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. 　Humans and most other animals carry millions of bacteria. 　Most are in the gut, and there are many on the skin. 　Most of the bacteria in and on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system, and many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. 　However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis, tetanus and bubonic plague. 　The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. 　Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. 　Bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals. 　Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes ("fission fungi"), bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. 　Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. 　Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. 　These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.

<font size=3>
Diana is a goddess in Roman and Hellenistic religion, primarily considered a patroness of the countryside, hunters, crossroads, and the Moon. 　She is equated with the Greek goddess Artemis, and absorbed much of Artemis' mythology early in Roman history, including a birth on the island of Delos to parents Jupiter and Latona, and a twin brother, Apollo, though she had an independent origin in Italy. 　Diana is considered a virgin goddess and protector of childbirth. 　Historically, Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities: Egeria the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and Virbius, the woodland god. 　Diana is revered in modern neopagan religions including Roman neopaganism, Stregheria, and Wicca. 　In the ancient, medieval, and modern periods, Diana has been considered a triple deity, merged with a goddess of the moon (Luna/Selene) and the underworld (usually Hecate).

Coordinates: 1°N 32°E﻿ / ﻿1°N 32°E﻿ / 1; 32 Uganda (Yuganda in Ugandan languages), officially the Republic of Uganda (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Uganda), is a landlocked country in East Africa. 　The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. 　The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. 　Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region. 　Uganda also lies within the Nile basin and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate. 　It has a population of around 49 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala. 　Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the country. 　From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established administrative law across the territory. 　Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. 　The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long military dictatorship led by Idi Amin. 　The official language is English, although the Constitution states that "any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law." 　Luganda, a central region-based language, is widely spoken across the Central and South Eastern regions of the country, and several other languages are also spoken, including Ateso, Lango, Acholi, Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, Luo, Rutooro, Samia, Jopadhola, and Lusoga. 　In 2005 Swahili, which is foreign and so viewed as being neutral, was proposed as the Uganda's second official language. 　But this has yet to be ratified by parliament. 　In 2022 Uganda has decided to make Swahili a mandatory subject in the school curriculum. 　Uganda's current president is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who took power in January 1986 after a protracted six-year guerrilla war. 　Following constitutional amendments that removed term limits for the president, he was able to stand and was elected president in the 2011, 2016 and 2021 general elections.

<font size=3>
Granite (/ˈɡrænɪt/) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. 　It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. 　It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions. 　These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers. 　Granite is typical of a larger family of granitic rocks, or granitoids, that are composed mostly of coarse-grained quartz and feldspars in varying proportions. 　These rocks are classified by the relative percentages of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase (the QAPF classification), with true granite representing granitic rocks rich in quartz and alkali feldspar. 　Most granitic rocks also contain mica or amphibole minerals, though a few (known as leucogranites) contain almost no dark minerals. 　Granite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures), hard, and tough. 　These properties have made granite a widespread construction stone throughout human history.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald>Herald</a> 

<font size=3>
A herald, or a herald of arms, is an officer of arms, ranking between pursuivant and king of arms. 　The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms. 　Heralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey messages or proclamations—in this sense being the predecessors of modern diplomats. 　In the Hundred Years' War, French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. 　During the Battle of Agincourt, the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle. 　Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a tabard, decorated with the coat of arms of his master. 　It was possibly due to their role in managing the tournaments of the Late Middle Ages that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' coats of arms. 　Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. 　Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament. 　This practice of heraldry became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. 　In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the royal coat of arms. 　There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. 　In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called "Heralds of Arms in Ordinary". 　Temporary appointments can be made of "Heralds of Arms Extraordinary". 　These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a coronation. 　The Canadian Heraldic Authority has created the position of "Herald of Arms Emeritus" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists. 　In Scotland, some Scottish clan chiefs, the heads of great noble houses, still appoint private officers of arms to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants. 　In addition, many orders of chivalry have heralds attached to them. 　These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. 　Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. 　In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the Dutch monarch's inauguration where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.

A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a health facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. 　Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded. 　They typically cover the primary care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer more specialized treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays. 　Most commonly, the English word clinic refers to a general practice, run by one or more general practitioners offering small therapeutic treatments, but it can also mean a specialist clinic. 　Some clinics retain the name "clinic" even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school.

Stockholm (Swedish: [ˈstɔ̂kː(h)ɔlm] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Sweden as well as the largest urban area in Scandinavia. 　Approximately 980,000 people live in the municipality, with 1.6 million in the urban area, and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area. 　The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea. 　Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. 　The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. 　It is also the county seat of Stockholm County. 　For several hundred years, Stockholm was the capital of Finland as well (Finnish: Tukholma), which was then a part of Sweden. 　The population of the municipality of Stockholm is expected to reach one million people in 2024. 　Stockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden. 　The Stockholm region alone accounts for over a third of the country's GDP, and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per capita. 　Ranked as an alpha-global city, it is the largest in Scandinavia and the main centre for corporate headquarters in the Nordic region. 　The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm School of Economics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University. 　It hosts the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies and banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall. 　One of the city's most prized museums, the Vasa Museum, is the most visited non-art museum in Scandinavia. 　The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950, is well known for the decor of its stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world. 　Sweden's national football arena is located north of the city centre, in Solna. 　Avicii Arena, the national indoor arena, is in the southern part of the city. 　The city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics. 　Stockholm is the seat of the Swedish government and most of its agencies, including the highest courts in the judiciary, and the official residencies of the Swedish monarch and the Prime Minister. 　The government has its seat in the Rosenbad building, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) is seated in the Parliament House, and the Prime Minister's residence is adjacent at Sager House. 　Stockholm Palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the Swedish monarch, while Drottningholm Palace in neighboring Ekerö serves as the Royal Family's private residence.

A lease is a contractual arrangement calling for the user (referred to as the lessee) to pay the owner (referred to as the lessor) for the use of an asset. 　Property, buildings and vehicles are common assets that are leased. 　Industrial or business equipment are also leased. 　Basically a lease agreement is a contract between two parties: the lessor and the lessee. 　The lessor is the legal owner of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments. 　The lessee also agrees to abide by various conditions regarding their use of the property or equipment. 　For example, a person leasing a car may agree to the condition that the car will only be used for personal use. 　The term rental agreement can refer to two kinds of leases: A lease in which the asset is tangible property. 　Here, the user rents the asset (e.g. land or goods) let out or rented out by the owner (the verb to lease is less precise because it can refer to either of these actions). 　Examples of a lease for intangible property include use of a computer program (similar to a license, but with different provisions), or use of a radio frequency (such as a contract with a cell-phone provider). 　A periodic lease agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some regions of the United States.
