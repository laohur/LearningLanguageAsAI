<font size=3>
A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background. 　Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns. 　Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue. 　The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. 　Newspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). 　However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely. 　Newspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for merchants. 　By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers. 　Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record. 　With the advent of the internet many newspapers are now digital, with their news presented online rather than in a physical format, with there now being a decline in sales for paper copies of newspapers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin>Latin</a> 
<font size=3>
Latin (lingua Latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna] or Latīnum, [laˈtiːnʊ̃]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. 　Latin was originally a dialect spoken in the lower Tiber area (then known as Latium) around present-day Rome, but through the power of the Roman Republic it became the dominant language in the Italian region and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire. 　Even after the fall of Western Rome, Latin remained the common language of international communication, science, scholarship and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when other regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage, and it eventually became a dead language in the modern linguistic definition. 　Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), six or seven noun cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect), three persons, three moods, two voices (passive and active), two or three aspects, and two numbers (singular and plural). 　The Latin alphabet is directly derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. 　By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardized into Classical Latin used by educated elites. 　Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken at that time among lower-class commoners and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights Plautus and Terence and author Petronius. 　Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century, and its various Vulgar Latin dialects developed in the 6th to 9th centuries into the modern Romance languages. 　Medieval Latin was used during the Middle Ages as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance, which then used Renaissance Latin. 　Later, New Latin evolved during the early modern era to eventually become various forms of rarely spoken Contemporary Latin, one of which, Ecclesiastical Latin, remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church at Vatican City. 　Latin has also greatly influenced the English language and historically contributed many words to the English lexicon after the Christianization of Anglo-Saxons and the Norman conquest. 　In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are still used in English descriptions of theology, science disciplines (especially anatomy and taxonomy), medicine, and law.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor>Emperor</a> 
<font size=3>
An emperor (from Latin: imperator, via Old French: empereor) is a monarch, and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. 　Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (empress consort), mother (empress dowager), or a woman who rules in her own right and name (empress regnant). 　Emperors are generally recognized to be of the highest monarchic honor and rank, surpassing kings. 　In Europe, the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages, considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe. 　The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as "Emperor". 　Both emperors and kings are monarchs or sovereigns, but both emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. 　In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation. 　Therefore, a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler, or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. 　However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts—the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India, though she was declared Empress of India. 　In Western Europe, the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor, whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii, i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. 　Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. 　Although technically an elective title, by the late 16th century the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria and following the Thirty Years' War their control over the states (outside the Habsburg monarchy, i.e. Austria, Bohemia and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. 　However, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of the French in 1804 and was shortly followed by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared himself Emperor of Austria in the same year. 　The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until Francis II abdicated that position in 1806. 　In Eastern Europe, the monarchs of Russia also used translatio imperii to wield imperial authority as successors to the Eastern Roman Empire. 　Their status was officially recognized by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. 　However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of Tsar even after Peter the Great adopted the title of Emperor of All Russia in 1721. 　Historians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. 　Such Pre-Roman titles as Great King or King of Kings, used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. 　Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the Athenian Empire of the late 5th century BC, the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenets and the Soviet and American "empires" of the Cold War era. 　However, such "empires" did not need to be headed by an "emperor". 　Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century. 　For purposes of protocol, emperors were once given precedence over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence among heads of state who are sovereigns—whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and, to a lesser degree, presidents—is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. 　Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. 　In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. 　Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.

<font size=3>
In social science, agency is the capacity of individuals to have the power and resources to fulfill their potential. 　For instance, structure consists of those factors of influence (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, ability, customs, etc.) that determine or limit agents and their decisions. 　The influences from structure and agency are debated—it is unclear to what extent a person's actions are constrained by social systems. 　One's agency is one's independent capability or ability to act on one's will. 　This ability is affected by the cognitive belief structure which one has formed through one's experiences, and the perceptions held by the society and the individual, of the structures and circumstances of the environment one is in and the position one is born into. 　Disagreement on the extent of one's agency often causes conflict between parties, e.g. parents and children.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(psychology)>Agency (psychology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In psychology, agents are goal-directed entities that are able to monitor their environment to select and perform efficient means-ends actions that are available in a given situation to achieve an intended goal. 　Agency, therefore, implies the ability to perceive and to change the environment of the agent. 　Crucially, it also entails intentionality to represent the goal-state in the future, equifinal variability to be able to achieve the intended goal-state with different actions in different contexts, and rationality of actions in relation to their goal to produce the most efficient action available. 　Cognitive scientists and psychologists have thoroughly investigated agency attribution in humans and non-human animals, since social cognitive mechanisms such as communication, social learning, imitation, or theory of mind presuppose the ability to identify agents and differentiate them from inanimate, non-agentive objects. 　This ability has also been assumed to have a major effect on inferential and predictive processes of the observers of agents, because agentive entities are expected to perform autonomous behavior based on their current and previous knowledge and intentions. 　On the other hand, inanimate objects are supposed to react to external physical forces. 　Although the concepts are often confused with one another, sensitivity to agency and the sense of agency are distinct and separate concepts. 　The sensitivity to agency can be explained as a cognitive ability to identify agentive entities in the environment, while the sense of agency refers to the exertion of control over the environment and sometimes to self-efficacy, which is an individual's learned belief of how able they are to succeed in specific situations.

<font size=3>
Concepts are defined as abstract ideas. 　They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of the concept behind principles, thoughts and beliefs. 　They play an important role in all aspects of cognition. 　As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. 　The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science. 　In contemporary philosophy, there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is: Concepts as mental representations, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects) Concepts as abilities, where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states) Concepts as Fregean senses, where concepts are abstract objects, as opposed to mental objects and mental states Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". 　Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. 　For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair". 　Concepts may be exact, or inexact. 　When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of tree, it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking. 　A concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas. 　Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. 　Concepts are regularly formalized in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence. 　Examples of specific high-level conceptual classes in these fields include classes, schema or categories. 　In informal use the word concept often just means any idea.

<font size=3>
Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. 　This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work. 　At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). 　Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. 　For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. 　An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. 　The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. 　As of 2023[update], most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past. 　The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. 　They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages. 　High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. 　Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture>Architecture</a> 
<font size=3>
Architecture is the art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished from the skills associated with construction. 　It is both the process and the product of sketching, conceiving, planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures. 　The term comes from Latin architectura; from Ancient Greek ἀρχιτέκτων (arkhitéktōn) 'architect'; from ἀρχι- (arkhi-) 'chief', and τέκτων (téktōn) 'creator'. 　Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. 　Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. 　The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents. 　For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art. 　Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times. 　The earliest surviving text on architectural theories is the 1st century AD treatise De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, and beauty). 　Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found in their proportions. 　Giorgio Vasari wrote Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and put forward the idea of style in the Western arts in the 16th century. 　In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that "form follows function". 　"Function" began to replace the classical "utility" and was understood to include not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural dimensions. 　The idea of sustainable architecture was introduced in the late 20th century. 　Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to successful replication. 　Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. 　Indian and Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. 　In fact, During the European Middle Ages, pan-European styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects known by name. 　Later, the roles of architects and engineers became separated. 　Modern architecture began after World War I as an avant-garde movement that sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. 　Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures. 　Many architects became disillusioned with modernism which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and contemporary architecture developed. 　Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.

<font size=3>
Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing. 　From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. 　The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. 　Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. 　In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection. 　In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. 　This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting. 　In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation>Equation</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, an equation is a formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by connecting them with the equals sign =. 　The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English, any well-formed formula consisting of two expressions related with an equals sign is an equation. 　Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. 　The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. 　There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. 　An identity is true for all values of the variables. 　A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables. 　An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign ("="). 　The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" of the equation. 　Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. 　Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides. 　The most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials. 　The sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. 　For example, the equation A x 2 + B x + C − y = 0 {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0} has left-hand side A x 2 + B x + C − y {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y} , which has four terms, and right-hand side 0 {\displaystyle 0} , consisting of just one term. 　The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables). 　An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. 　When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. 　If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. 　More generally, an equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides. 　In Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. 　As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. 　This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics. 　Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. 　When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. 　To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. 　Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. 　The techniques used are different and come from number theory. 　These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions. 　Differential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. 　They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. 　Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. 　The "=" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal>Signal</a> 
<font size=3>
In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. 　Any quantity that can vary over space or time can be used as a signal to share messages between observers. 　The IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing includes audio, video, speech, image, sonar, and radar as examples of signal. 　A signal may also be defined as any observable change in a quantity over space or time (a time series), even if it does not carry information. 　In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms, ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food. 　Signaling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell signaling. 　Signaling theory, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for evolution is the ability of animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. 　In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. 　For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse. 　Another important property of a signal is its entropy or information content. 　Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content. 　The information of a signal is often accompanied by noise, which primarily refers to unwanted modifications of signals, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk). 　The reduction of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity. 　The separation of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances. 　Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have advanced the design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage, and manipulation of information. 　In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines: electronic engineering and computer engineering developed to specialize in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals, while design engineering developed to address the functional design of signals in user–machine interfaces.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep>Sleep</a> 
<font size=3>
Sleep is a sedentary state of mind and body. 　It is characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and reduced interactions with surroundings. 　It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns. 　Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM sleep and non-REM sleep. 　Although REM stands for "rapid eye movement", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. 　Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. 　During sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. 　The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night. 　The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. 　Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years. 　Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. 　The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns. 　Common sources of artificial light include outdoor lighting and the screens of electronic devices such as smartphones and televisions, which emit large amounts of blue light, a form of light typically associated with daytime. 　This disrupts the release of the hormone melatonin needed to regulate the sleep-cycle.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution>Constitution</a> 
<font size=3>
A constitution is the aggregate of fundamental principles or established precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other type of entity and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed. 　When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are encompassed in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution. 　The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a notable example of an uncodified constitution; it is instead written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties. 　Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign countries to companies and unincorporated associations. 　A treaty which establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. 　Within states, a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. 　Some constitutions, especially codified constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross, such as fundamental rights. 　The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any country in the world, with 146,385 words in its English-language version, while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution with 3,814 words. 　The Constitution of San Marino might be the world's oldest active written constitution, since some of its core documents have been in operation since 1600, while the Constitution of the United States is the oldest active codified constitution. 　The historical life expectancy of a constitution since 1789 is approximately 19 years.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow>Yellow</a> 
<font size=3>
Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of light. 　It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575–585 nm. 　It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. 　In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. 　Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. 　They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases. 　Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet). 　Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old. 　Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas. 　In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics. 　In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. 　In China, bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet. 　According to surveys in Europe, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, happiness, and spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, greed, and, in the U.S., cowardice. 　In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. 　In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.
