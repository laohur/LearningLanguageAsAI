## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods>Goods</a> 

<font size=3>
In economics, goods are items that satisfy human wants and provide utility, for example, to a consumer making a purchase of a satisfying product. 　A common distinction is made between goods which are transferable, and services, which are not transferable. 　A good is an "economic good" if it is useful to people but scarce in relation to its demand so that human effort is required to obtain it. 　In contrast, free goods, such as air, are naturally in abundant supply and need no conscious effort to obtain them. 　Private goods are things owned by people, such as televisions, living room furniture, wallets, cellular telephones, almost anything owned or used on a daily basis that is not food-related. 　A consumer good or "final good" is any item that is ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. 　For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. 　For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods. 　Commercial goods are construed as tangible products that are manufactured and then made available for supply to be used in an industry of commerce. 　Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes, and even roofing materials. 　Commercial and personal goods as categories are very broad and cover almost everything a person sees from the time they wake up in their home, on their commute to work to their arrival at the workplace. 　Commodities may be used as a synonym for economic goods but often refer to marketable raw materials and primary products. 　Although common goods are tangible, certain classes of goods, such as information, only take intangible forms. 　For example, among other goods an apple is a tangible object, while news belongs to an intangible class of goods and can be perceived only by means of an instrument such as printers or television.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud>Cloud</a> 

<font size=3>
In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. 　Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. 　On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. 　Clouds are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. 　Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. 　There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name. 　Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. 　It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera. 　The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform. 　Low-level clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. 　However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. 　In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing. 　Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes. 　They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical. 　Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. 　Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names. 　In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. 　They may have the appearance of stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. 　They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. 　Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. 　However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water. 　Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth. 　They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect. 　The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere. 　Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. 　Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability>Probability</a> 

<font size=3>
Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. 　The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. 　The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. 　A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. 　Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%). 　These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. 　Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.

<font size=3>
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good, that involves the enjoyment of something. 　It contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling bad. 　It is closely related to value, desire and action: humans and other conscious animals find pleasure enjoyable, positive or worthy of seeking. 　A great variety of activities may be experienced as pleasurable, like eating, having sex, listening to music or playing games. 　Pleasure is part of various other mental states such as ecstasy, euphoria and flow. 　Happiness and well-being are closely related to pleasure but not identical with it. 　There is no general agreement as to whether pleasure should be understood as a sensation, a quality of experiences, an attitude to experiences or otherwise. 　Pleasure plays a central role in the family of philosophical theories known as hedonism.

An aside is a dramatic device in which a character speaks to the audience. 　By convention, the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. 　It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. 　An aside is usually a brief comment, rather than a speech, such as a monologue or soliloquy. 　Unlike a public contains an early use of character aside. 　More recently, it was used by Ian Richardson's character Francis Urquhart in the 1990 BBC mini-series House of Cards, as well as by Kevin Spacey's character Frank Underwood in the 2013 Netflix original series of the same name. 　It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character's plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect. 　It was also used by Michaela Coel’s character Tracey in the Channel 4 comedy series Chewing Gum; and by the titular character in Fleabag, written and played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. 　==

<font size=3>
Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms. 　Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields.　[page needed] For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law. 　An extremely important definition of income is Haig–Simons income, which defines income as Consumption + Change in net worth and is widely used in economics. 　For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year. 　Discretionary income is often defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers. 　In the field of public economics, the concept may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability, with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income. 　For a firm, gross income can be defined as sum of all revenue minus the cost of goods sold. 　Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation, interest, and taxes.

<font size=3>
A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work. 　The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy, such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). 　The heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine. 　Other times, the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion. 　Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. 　Hydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized. 　Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).

<font size=3>
Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. 　A person who sings is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music). 　Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. 　Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. 　Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. 　Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Japanese music, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal, and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music. 　Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. 　It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. 　Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. 　If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. 　Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). 　Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers

A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design and colours. 　It is used as a symbol, a signalling device, or for decoration. 　The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the maritime environment, where semaphore is used). 　Many flags fall into groups of similar designs called flag families. 　The study of flags is known as "vexillology" from the Latin vexillumcode: lat promoted to code: la , meaning "flag" or "banner". 　National flags are patriotic symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong military associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. 　Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for decorative purposes. 　Some military units are called "flags" after their use of flags. 　A flag (Arabic: لواءcode: ara promoted to code: ar ) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries. 　In Spain, a flag (Spanish: banderacode: spa promoted to code: es ) is a battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion.

<font size=3>
In molecular cloning, a vector is any particle (e.g., plasmids, cosmids, Lambda phages) used as a vehicle to artificially carry a foreign nucleic sequence – usually DNA – into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. 　A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. 　The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. 　Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. 　Common to all engineered vectors have an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker. 　The vector itself generally carries a DNA sequence that consists of an insert (in this case the transgene) and a larger sequence that serves as the "backbone" of the vector. 　The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell. 　All vectors may be used for cloning and are therefore cloning vectors, but there are also vectors designed specially for cloning, while others may be designed specifically for other purposes, such as transcription and protein expression. 　Vectors designed specifically for the expression of the transgene in the target cell are called expression vectors, and generally have a promoter sequence that drives expression of the transgene. 　Simpler vectors called transcription vectors are only capable of being transcribed but not translated: they can be replicated in a target cell but not expressed, unlike expression vectors. 　Transcription vectors are used to amplify their insert. 　The manipulation of DNA is normally conducted on E. coli vectors, which contain elements necessary for their maintenance in E. coli. 　However, vectors may also have elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism such as yeast, plant or mammalian cells, and these vectors are called shuttle vectors. 　Such vectors have bacterial or viral elements which may be transferred to the non-bacterial host organism, however other vectors termed intragenic vectors have also been developed to avoid the transfer of any genetic material from an alien species. 　Insertion of a vector into the target cell is usually called transformation for bacterial cells, transfection for eukaryotic cells, although insertion of a viral vector is often called transduction.

Coordinates: 32°N 53°E﻿ / ﻿32°N 53°E﻿ / 32; 53 You may need rendering support to display the Persian text in this article correctly. 　Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, and also called Persia, is a country located in Western Asia. 　It is bordered by Iraq and Turkey to the west, by Azerbaijan and Armenia to the northwest, by the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan to the north, by Afghanistan and Pakistan to the east, and by the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. 　It covers an area of 1.64 million square kilometres (0.63 million square miles), making it the 17th-largest country. 　Iran has an estimated population of 86.8 million, making it the 17th-most populous country in the world, and the second-largest in the Middle East. 　Its largest cities, in descending order, are the capital Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz, and Tabriz. 　The country is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. 　It was first unified by the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Persian Empire, which became one of the largest empires in history and a superpower. 　The Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was subsequently divided into several Hellenistic states. 　An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sassanid Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries. 　Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran. 　It subsequently became a major center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age. 　Over the next two centuries, a series of native Iranian Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuk Turks and the Mongols conquered the region. 　In the 15th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity, and converted the country to Shia Islam. 　Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran presided over the most powerful military in the world, though by the 19th century, a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses. 　The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution. 　Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence. 　He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963. 　After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first Supreme Leader. 　The government of Iran is an Islamic theocracy that includes some elements of a presidential system, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "Supreme Leader"; a position held by Ali Khamenei since Khomeini's death in 1989. 　The Iranian government is authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant constraints and abuses against human rights and civil liberties, including several violent suppressions of mass protests, unfair elections, and limited rights for women and for children. 　It is also a focal point for Shia Islam within the Middle East, countering the long-existing Arab and Sunni hegemony within the region. 　Since the Iranian Revolution, the country is widely considered to be the largest adversary of Israel and also of Saudi Arabia. 　Iran is also considered to be one of the biggest players within Middle Eastern affairs, with its government being involved both directly and indirectly in the majority of modern Middle Eastern conflicts. 　Iran is a regional and middle power, with a geopolitically strategic location in the Asian continent. 　It is a founding member of the United Nations, the ECO, the OIC, and the OPEC. 　It has large reserves of fossil fuels—including the second-largest natural gas supply and the third-largest proven oil reserves. 　The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　Historically a multi-ethnic country, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, with the largest of these being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis, and Lurs.

Beauty is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes these objects pleasurable to perceive. 　Such objects include landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. 　Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. 　As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart. 　One difficulty in understanding beauty is because it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. 　Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be "in the eye of the beholder". 　It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the "sense of taste", can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. 　This would suggest that the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are intersubjective, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully subjective or fully objective. 　Conceptions of beauty aim to capture what is essential to all beautiful things. 　Classical conceptions define beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. 　Hedonist conceptions see a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. 　Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude towards them or of their function.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral>Cathedral</a> 

<font size=3>
A cathedral is a church that contains the cathedra (Latin for 'seat') of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. 　Churches with the function of "cathedral" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and some Lutheran churches. 　Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appeared in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures, and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches, and episcopal residences. 　The cathedral is more important in the hierarchy than the church because it is from the cathedral that the bishop governs the area under his or her administrative authority. 　Following the Protestant Reformation, the Christian church in several parts of Western Europe, such as Scotland, the Netherlands, certain Swiss Cantons and parts of Germany, adopted a presbyterian polity that did away with bishops altogether. 　Where ancient cathedral buildings in these lands are still in use for congregational worship, they generally retain the title and dignity of "cathedral", maintaining and developing distinct cathedral functions, but void of hierarchical supremacy. 　From the 16th century onwards, but especially since the 19th century, churches originating in Western Europe have undertaken vigorous programmes of missionary activity, leading to the founding of large numbers of new dioceses with associated cathedral establishments of varying forms in Asia, Africa, Australasia, Oceania and the Americas. 　In addition, both the Catholic Church and Orthodox churches have formed new dioceses within formerly Protestant lands for converts and migrant co-religionists. 　Consequently, it is not uncommon to find Christians in a single city being served by three or more cathedrals of differing denominations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl>Bowl</a> 

<font size=3>
A bowl is a typically round dish or container generally used for preparing, serving, or consuming food. 　The interior of a bowl is characteristically shaped like a spherical cap, with the edges and the bottom forming a seamless curve. 　This makes bowls especially suited for holding liquids and loose food, as the contents of the bowl are naturally concentrated in its center by the force of gravity. 　The exterior of a bowl is most often round but can be of any shape, including rectangular. 　The size of bowls varies from small bowls used to hold a single serving of food to large bowls, such as punch bowls or salad bowls, that are often used to hold or store more than one portion of food. 　There is some overlap between bowls, cups, and plates. 　Very small bowls, such as the tea bowl, are often called cups, while plates with especially deep wells are often called bowls. 　In many cultures bowls are the most common kind of vessel used for serving and eating food. 　Historically small bowls were also used for serving both tea and alcoholic drinks. 　In Western culture plates and cups are more commonly used.

<font size=3>
A threat is a communication of intent to inflict harm or loss on another person. 　Intimidation is a tactic used between conflicting parties to make the other timid or psychologically insecure for coercion or control. 　The act of intimidation for coercion is considered as a threat. 　Threatening or threatening behavior (or criminal threatening behavior) is the crime of intentionally or knowingly putting another person in fear of bodily injury. 　"Threat of harm generally involves a perception of injury...physical or mental damage...act or instance of injury, or a material and detriment or loss to a person." 　Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against their will. 　In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation.

Lyrics are words that make up a song, usually consisting of verses and choruses. 　The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. 　The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a "libretto" and their writer, as a "librettist". 　The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. 　Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. 　Rappers can also create lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staring>Staring</a> 

<font size=3>
Staring is a prolonged gaze or fixed look. 　In staring, one object or person is the continual focus of visual interest, for an amount of time. 　Staring can be interpreted as being either hostile like disapproval of another's behavior, or the result of intense concentration, interest or affection. 　Staring behavior can be considered as a form of aggression like when it is an invasion of an individual's privacy in certain contexts, or as a nonverbal cue to convey feelings of attraction in a social setting. 　The resultant behavior or action defines whether it is aggressive in nature (e.g. leering that results in street harassment), passive or active expression of attraction, etc. 　However, to some extent staring often occurs accidentally, and often a person would be simply staring into a space for awareness, or could be lost in thought, stupefied, or be unable to see. 　As such, the meaning of a person's staring behavior depends upon the attributions made by the observer. 　In a staring contest, a mutual staring can take the form of a battle of wills. 　When eye contact is reciprocated, it could be an aggressive-dominating game where the loser is the person who looks away first. 　Staring conceptually also implies confronting the inevitable – 'staring death in the face', or 'staring into the abyss'.　[citation needed] Group staring evokes and emphasizes paranoia; such as the archetypal stranger walking into a saloon in a Western to be greeted by the stares of all the regulars. 　The fear of being stared at is called scopophobia.

Jason (/ˈdʒeɪsən/ JAY-sən; Greek: Ἰάσων, translit. Iásōn [i.ǎːsɔːn]) was an ancient Greek mythological hero and leader of the Argonauts, whose quest for the Golden Fleece featured in Greek literature. 　He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. 　He was married to the sorceress Medea. 　He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side. 　Jason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem Argonautica and the tragedy Medea. 　In the modern world, Jason has emerged as a character in various adaptations of his myths, such as the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts and the 2000 TV miniseries of the same name.

Coordinates: 13°N 122°E﻿ / ﻿13°N 122°E﻿ / 13; 122 The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (listen); Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas), is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. 　It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean and consists of around 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. 　The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest. 　It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. 　The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2021[update], it had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's thirteenth-most-populous country. 　The Philippines has diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. 　Manila is the country's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City; both lie within the urban area of Metro Manila. 　Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. 　Adoption of animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called kedatuan, rajahnates, and sultanates. 　The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. 　In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villaloboscode: spa promoted to code: es named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. 　Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming ruled by the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. 　During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. 　In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. 　Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino revolutionaries declared the First Philippine Republic. 　The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. 　Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. 　Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a decades-long dictatorship by a nonviolent revolution. 　The Philippines is an emerging market and a newly industrialized country whose economy is transitioning from being agriculture centered to services and manufacturing centered. 　It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. 　The location of the Philippines as an island country both on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes it prone to earthquakes and typhoons. 　The country has a variety of natural resources and is home to a globally significant level of biodiversity.

<font size=3>
A desk or bureau is a piece of furniture with a flat table-style work surface used in a school, office, home or the like for academic, professional or domestic activities such as reading, writing, or using equipment such as a computer. 　Desks often have one or more drawers, compartments, or pigeonholes to store items such as office supplies and papers. 　Desks are usually made of wood or metal, although materials such as glass are sometimes seen. 　Some desks have the form of a table, although usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk), unlike most usual tables. 　Some desks do not have the form of a table, for instance, an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person's lap. 　Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. 　In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). 　Some people use standing desks to be able to stand while using them.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream>Stream</a> 

<font size=3>
A stream is a continuous body of surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel. 　Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to by a variety of local or regional names. 　Long large streams are usually called rivers, while smaller, less voluminous and more intermittent streams are known as streamlets, brooks or creeks. 　The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs – surface runoff (from precipitation or meltwater), daylighted subterranean water, and surfaced groundwater (spring water). 　The surface and subterranean water are highly variable between periods of rainfall. 　Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation. 　The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls. 　Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. 　The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. 　Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. 　The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is a core element of environmental geography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform>Reform</a> 

<font size=3>
Reform (Latin: reformo) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. 　The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from Christopher Wyvill's Association movement which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim. 　Reform is generally regarded as antithetical to revolution. 　Developing countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies. 　This can include reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service, and public financial management. 　In the United States, rotation in office or term limits would, by contrast, be more revolutionary,[citation needed] in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.

A poet is a person who studies and creates poetry. 　Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. 　A poet may simply be the creator (thinker, songwriter, writer, or author) who creates (composes) poems (oral or written), or they may also perform their art to an audience. 　The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, expressing ideas either in a literal sense (such as communicating about a specific event or place) or metaphorically. 　Poets have existed since prehistory, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods. 　Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed over time, resulting in countless poets as diverse as the literature that (since the advent of writing systems) they have produced.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly>Fly</a> 

<font size=3>
Flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek δι- di- "two", and πτερόν pteron "wing". 　Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics. 　Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described. 　Flies have a mobile head, with a pair of large compound eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. 　Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. 　Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are often laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. 　Other species like Metopia argyrocephala are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals. 　The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults. 　Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance. 　Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. 　Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. 　Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases; and houseflies, commensal with humans all over the world, spread food-borne illnesses. 　Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. 　Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. 　Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. 　They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.

Shooting is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon (such as a gun, bow, crossbow, slingshot, or blowpipe). 　Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting. 　When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants. 　Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting, or in combat. 　The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter. 　A skilled, accurate shooter is a marksman or sharpshooter, and a person's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their marksmanship.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey>Turkey</a>

Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Türkiye (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti] (listen)), is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. 　It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. 　Cyprus is off the south coast. 　Most people are Turks, and Kurds are the largest minority. 　Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre. 　One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Hittites, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks, Persians and others. 　Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions were culturally Hellenised, and this continued during the Byzantine era. 　The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities. 　Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period. 　After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. 　From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power declined with a gradual loss of territories. 　Mahmud II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century. 　The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party period. 　The Three Pashas took control with the 1913 coup d'état, and entered World War I as one of the Central Powers in 1914. 　During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects. 　After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. 　The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923. 　With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic. 　Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies. 　Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952. 　During the Cold War years, the country endured two military coups in 1960 and 1980, and a period of economic and political turmoil in the 1970s. 　The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability. 　Since 2002, the country's political system has been dominated by the AKP and its leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, under whom a decade of rapid growth in nominal GDP took place until 2013, which was followed by a period of recession and stagnation in terms of USD-based nominal GDP between 2013 and 2020, and high inflation as of 2023. 　The AKP government's initial economic achievements, which were financed through privatization revenues and loans, were overshadowed by democratic backsliding and an erosion in the separation of powers and civil liberties, which gained momentum after the parliamentary republic was replaced by an executive presidential system with a referendum in 2017. 　Turkey is a regional power with a geopolitically significant strategic location. 　The economy of Turkey, which is a founding member of the OECD and G20, is classified among the E7, EAGLEs and NICs, and currently ranks twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP and eleventh-largest by PPP. 　Turkey is a charter member of the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank; a founding member of the OSCE, OIC, BSEC, ECO, MIKTA, TURKSOY and OTS; and an early member of NATO. 　After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995, and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. 　Turkey has a rich cultural legacy shaped by centuries of history and the influence of the various peoples that have inhabited its territory over several millennia; it is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is among the most visited countries in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion>Billion</a> 

<font size=3>
Billion is a word for a large number, and it has two distinct definitions: 1,000,000,000, i.e. one thousand million, or 109 (ten to the ninth power), as defined on the short scale. 　This is its only current meaning in English. 　1,000,000,000,000, i.e. one million million, or 1012 (ten to the twelfth power), as defined on the long scale. 　This number, which is one thousand times larger than the short scale billion, is now referred to in English as one trillion. 　However, this number is the historical meaning in English for the word "billion" (with the exception of the United States), a meaning which was still in official use in British English until some time after World War II. 　American English adopted the short scale definition from the French (it enjoyed usage in France at the time, alongside the long-scale definition). 　The United Kingdom used the long scale billion until 1974, when the government officially switched to the short scale, but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism. 　Other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion. 　Milliard, another term for one thousand million, is extremely rare in English, but words similar to it are very common in other European languages. 　For example, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Hebrew (Asia), Hungarian, Italian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish (although the expression mil millones — a thousand million — is far more common), Swedish, Tajik, Turkish, Ukrainian and Uzbek — use milliard, or a related word, for the short scale billion, and billion (or a related word) for the long scale billion. 　Thus for these languages billion is a thousand times larger than the modern English billion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali>Ali</a> 

<font size=3>
ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (Arabic: عَلِيّ بْن أَبِي طَالِب; c. 600 – 661 CE) was the last of four Rightly Guided Caliphs to rule Islam (r. 656–661) immediately after the death of Muhammad, and he was the first Shia Imam. 　The issue of succession caused a major rift between Muslims and divided them into two major branches: Shia following an appointed hereditary leadership among Ali's descendants, and Sunni following political dynasties. 　Ali's assassination in the Grand Mosque of Kufa by a Kharijite coincided with the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate. 　The Imam Ali Shrine and the city of Najaf were built around Ali's tomb and it is visited yearly by millions of devotees. 　Ali was a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, raised by him from the age of 5, and accepted his claim of divine revelation by age 11, being among the first to do so. 　Ali played a pivotal role in the early years of Islam while Muhammad was in Mecca and under severe persecution. 　After Muhammad's relocation to Medina in 622, Ali married his daughter Fatima and, among others, fathered Hasan and Husayn, the second and third Shia Imams. 　Muhammad called him his brother, guardian and successor, and he was the flag bearer in most of the wars and became famous for his bravery. 　On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad uttered the phrase, "Whoever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla." 　But the meaning of Mawla became disputed. 　Shias believed that Ali was appointed by Muhammad to lead Islam, and Sunnis interpreted the word as friendship and love. 　While Ali was preparing Muhammad's body for burial, a group of Muslims met and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. 　Ali pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, after six months, but did not take part in the wars and political activity, except for the election of Uthman, the third caliph. 　However, he advised the three caliphs in religious, judicial, and political matters. 　After Uthman was killed, Ali was elected as the next Caliph, which coincided with the first civil wars between Muslims. 　Ali faced two separate opposition forces: a group in Mecca, who wanted to convene a council to determine the caliphate; and another group led by Mu'awiya in the Levant, who demanded revenge for Uthman's blood. 　He defeated the first group; but in the end, the Battle of Siffin led to an arbitration that favored Mu'awiya, who eventually defeated Ali militarily. 　Slain by the sword of Ibn Muljam Moradi, Ali was buried outside the city of Kufa. 　In the eyes of his admirers, he became an example of piety and un-corrupted Islam, as well as the chivalry of pre-Islamic Arabia. 　Several books are dedicated to his hadiths, sermons, and prayers, the most famous of which is Nahj al-Balagha.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf>Wolf</a> 

<font size=3>
The wolf (Canis lupus; PL: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. 　More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise wild subspecies. 　The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. 　The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. 　The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white. 　Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour, including individual or group howling. 　It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. 　Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. 　Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of mortality. 　The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. 　Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. 　Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves. 　The global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 　Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. 　The wolf is also considered the ancestor of the domestic dog. 　Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. 　Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, farmers, ranchers, and shepherds.

<font size=3>
An architect is a person who plans, designs and oversees the construction of buildings. 　To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose. 　Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin architectuscode: lat promoted to code: la , which derives from the Greek (arkhi-, chief + tekton, builder), i.e., chief builder. 　The professional requirements for architects vary from location to location. 　An architect's decisions affect public safety and thus the architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. 　Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession.

<font size=3>
Wear is the damaging, gradual removal or deformation of material at solid surfaces. 　Causes of wear can be mechanical (e.g., erosion) or chemical (e.g., corrosion). 　The study of wear and related processes is referred to as tribology. 　Wear in machine elements, together with other processes such as fatigue and creep, causes functional surfaces to degrade, eventually leading to material failure or loss of functionality. 　Thus, wear has large economic relevance as first outlined in the Jost Report. 　Abrasive wear alone has been estimated to cost 1-4% of the gross national product of industrialized nations. 　Wear of metals occurs by plastic displacement of surface and near-surface material and by detachment of particles that form wear debris. 　The particle size may vary from millimeters to nanometers. 　This process may occur by contact with other metals, nonmetallic solids, flowing liquids, solid particles or liquid droplets entrained in flowing gasses. 　The wear rate is affected by factors such as type of loading (e.g., impact, static, dynamic), type of motion (e.g., sliding, rolling), temperature, and lubrication, in particular by the process of deposition and wearing out of the boundary lubrication layer. 　Depending on the tribosystem, different wear types and wear mechanisms can be observed.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 63°N 16°E﻿ / ﻿63°N 16°E﻿ / 63; 16 Sweden, formally the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe. 　It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge–tunnel across the Öresund. 　At 447,425 square kilometres (172,752 sq mi), Sweden is the largest Nordic country, the third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth-largest country in Europe. 　The capital and largest city is Stockholm. 　Sweden has a total population of 10.5 million, and a low population density of 25.5 inhabitants per square kilometre (66/sq mi), with around 87% of Swedes residing in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area, in the central and southern half of the country. 　Nature in Sweden is dominated by forests and many lakes, including some of the largest in Europe. 　Many long rivers run from the Scandes range through the landscape, primarily emptying into the northern tributaries of the Baltic Sea. 　It has an extensive coastline and most of the population lives near a major body of water. 　With the country ranging from 55°N to 69°N, the climate of Sweden is diverse due to the length of the country. 　The usual conditions are mild for the latitudes with a maritime south, continental centre and subarctic north. 　Snow cover is variable in the densely populated south, but reliable in higher latitudes. 　Furthermore, the rain shadow of the Scandes results in quite dry winters and sunny summers in much of the country. 　Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats (Swedish: Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. 　An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. 　After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population, the dominance of the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe threatened Scandinavia economically and politically. 　This led to the forming of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523. 　When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years' War on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began, forming the Swedish Empire, which remained one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. 　Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. 　The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. 　In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, a longer span of peacetime than even Switzerland. 　Sweden maintained an official policy of neutrality during wartime and non-participation in military alliances during peacetime, although Sweden secretly relied on U.S. nuclear submarines during the Cold War. 　Sweden has since 2008 joined EU battlegroups, provided intelligence to NATO and since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO. 　Sweden is a highly developed country ranked seventh in the Human Development Index, it is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with legislative power vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag. 　It is a unitary state, currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities. 　Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. 　It has the world's 12th highest GDP per capita and ranks very highly in quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, income equality, gender equality and prosperity. 　Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 but rejected Eurozone membership following a referendum. 　It is also a member of the United Nations, the Nordic Council, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene>Gene</a> 

<font size=3>
In biology, the word gene (from Greek: γένος, génos; meaning generation or birth or gender) can have several different meanings. 　The Mendelian gene is a basic unit of heredity and the molecular gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is transcribed to produce a functional RNA. 　There are two types of molecular genes: protein-coding genes and noncoding genes. 　During gene expression, the DNA is first copied into RNA. 　The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. 　The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. 　These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. 　Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. 　Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. 　Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or the number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, the risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life. 　Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. 　These alleles encode slightly different versions of a gene, which may cause different phenotypical traits. 　Usage of the term "having a gene" (e.g., "good genes," "hair color gene") typically refers to containing a different allele of the same, shared gene. 　Genes evolve due to natural selection / survival of the fittest and genetic drift of the alleles. 　The concept of gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. 　For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. 　Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. 　Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression. 　The term gene was introduced by Danish botanist, plant physiologist and geneticist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909. 　It is inspired by the Ancient Greek: γόνος, gonos, that means offspring and procreation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric>Eric</a> 

<font size=3>
The given name Eric, Erich, Erikk, Erik, Erick, or Eirik is derived from the Old Norse name Eiríkr [ˈɛiˌriːkz̠] (or Eríkr [ˈeˌriːkz̠] in Old East Norse due to monophthongization). 　The first element, ei- may be derived from the older Proto-Norse *aina(z), meaning "one, alone, unique", as in the form Æ∆inrikr explicitly, but it could also be from *aiwa(z) "everlasting, eternity", as in the Gothic form Euric. 　The second element -ríkr stems either from Proto-Germanic *ríks "king, ruler" (cf. Gothic reiks) or the therefrom derived *ríkijaz "kingly, powerful, rich, prince"; from the common Proto-Indo-European root *h₃rḗǵs. 　The name is thus usually taken to mean "sole ruler, autocrat" or "eternal ruler, ever powerful". 　Eric used in the sense of a proper noun meaning "one ruler" may be the origin of Eriksgata, and if so it would have meant "one ruler's journey". 　The tour was the medieval Swedish king's journey, when newly elected, to seek the acceptance of peripheral provinces. 　Eric is one of the most commonly used Germanic names in the United States, along with Robert, William, Edward and others. 　The most common spelling across Fennoscandia and in the Netherlands is Erik. 　In Norway, another form of the name (which has kept the Old Norse diphthong) Eirik is also commonly used. 　The modern Icelandic version is Eiríkur [ˈeiːˌriːkʏr̥], while the modern Faroese version is Eirikur. 　In Estonia and Finland (where Fenno-Swedish remains an official minority language), the standard Nordic name form Erik is found, but it may also be spelled phonetically as Eerik (Finnish: [ˈeːrik]), in accordance with Finnic language orthography, along with a slew of other unique Balto-Finnic variant forms including Eerikki, Eero, Erki and Erkki. 　Although the name was in use in Anglo-Saxon England, its use was reinforced by Scandinavian settlers arriving before the Norman conquest of England. 　It was an uncommon name in England until the Middle Ages, when it gained popularity, and finally became a common name in the 19th century. 　This was partly because of the publishing of the novel Eric, or, Little by Little by Frederic Farrar in 1858. 　The Latin form of the name is Euricus or Erīcus (Medieval Latin: [ɛˈriː.kus]), which was also adopted into Old Swedish usage (for example, cf. 15th century Kalmar Swedish historian Ericus Olai). 　Whence come the Greek forms Ερίκος (Eríkos) or Ερρίκος (Erríkos) (both pronounced [eˈri.kos]), in addition to the direct Nordic borrowing Έρικ (Érik). 　Éric (French: [e.ʁik]) is used in French, Erico or Errico in Italian, Érico in Portuguese. 　(Note some phonetically simplified modern forms may be conflated with descendants of cognate name Henry via Henrīcus, Henrik, from Proto-Germanic Haimarīks, sharing the stem *rīks.) 　Among Slavic languages, most using the Latin alphabet borrow Erik, but there also exists Polish Eryk. 　The name is adapted into Cyrillic as Russian Э́йрик (Éyrik) or Э́рик (Érik), and Ukrainian Е́рік (Érik). 　The Baltic languages use forms such as Latvian Ēriks and Lithuanian Erikas. 　And in Germany, Eric, Erik and Erich are used. 　In South America, the most common spelling is Erick. 　In Norway, Sweden and Finland, the name day for derivations of Erik and Eirik is 18 May, commemorating the death of Saint King Eric IX of Sweden, founder of the royal House of Eric. 　The feminine derivative is Erica or Erika.

<font size=3>
Efficiency is the often measurable ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. 　In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. 　In more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. 　It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. 　Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. 　In 2019, the European Commission said: "Resource efficiency means using the Earth's limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising impacts on the environment. It allows us to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input." 　Writer Deborah Stone notes that efficiency is "not a goal in itself. It is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value."

<font size=3>
Egypt (Arabic: مصر Miṣr [mesˁr], Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mɑsˤr]), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. 　It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. 　The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 　Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt, while Alexandria, the second-largest city, is an important industrial and tourist hub at the Mediterranean coast. 　At approximately 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the 14th-most populated country in the world. 　Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. 　Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. 　Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. 　Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which reflects its unique transcontinental location being simultaneously Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and North African. 　Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity, but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority, along with other lesser practiced faiths. 　Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained independence from the British Empire as a monarchy. 　Following the 1952 revolution, Egypt declared itself a republic, and in 1958 it merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, which dissolved in 1961. 　Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and occupying the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. 　In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords, officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and recognising Israel. 　After the Arab Spring, which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the country faced a protracted period of political unrest. 　Egypt's current government, a semi-presidential republic led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian or heading an authoritarian regime, responsible for perpetuating the country's poor human rights record. 　Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language. 　With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fourteenth-most populous in the world. 　The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. 　The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. 　About 43% of Egypt's residents live across the country's urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. 　Egypt is considered to be a regional power in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world, and a middle power worldwide. 　It is a developing country, ranking 97th on the Human Development Index. 　It has a diversified economy, which is the third-largest in Africa, the 33rd-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the 20th-largest globally by PPP. 　Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League, the African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the World Youth Forum.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel>Chapel</a> 

<font size=3>
A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small. 　The term has several meanings. 　First, smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels; the Lady chapel is a common type of these. 　Second, a chapel is a place of worship, sometimes non-denominational, that is part of a building,complex or vessel with some other main purpose, such as a school, college, hospital, palace or large aristocratic house, castle, barracks, prison, funeral home, cemetery, airport, or a military or commercial ship. 　Third, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease. 　A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel. 　Finally, for historical reasons, chapel is also often the term used by independent or nonconformist denominations for their places of worship in Great Britain, even where they are large and in practice they operate as a parish church. 　The earliest Christian places of worship are now often referred to as chapels, as they were not dedicated buildings but rather a dedicated chamber within a building. 　Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars which, if they occupied a distinct space, would often be called a chapel. 　In Russian Orthodox tradition, the chapels were built underneath city gates, where most people could visit them. 　The most famous example is the Iberian Chapel. 　Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship, they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily denote a specific denomination. 　In England—where the Church of England is established by law—non-denominational or inter-faith chapels in such institutions may nonetheless be consecrated by the local Anglican bishop. 　Non-denominational chapels are commonly encountered as part of a non-religious institution such as a hospital, airport, university or prison. 　Many military installations have chapels for the use of military personnel, normally under the leadership of a military chaplain.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein>Protein</a> 

<font size=3>
Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. 　Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. 　Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity. 　A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. 　A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. 　Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides. 　The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. 　The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. 　In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. 　Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. 　Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. 　Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. 　Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. 　A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. 　They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. 　Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable. 　Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. 　Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. 　Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. 　Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. 　In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. 　Digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use. 　Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. 　Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.

<font size=3>
Investment is the dedication of money to purchase of an asset to attain an increase in value over a period of time. 　Investment requires a sacrifice of some present asset, such as time, money, or effort. 　In finance, the purpose of investing is to generate a return from the invested asset. 　The return may consist of a gain (profit) or a loss realized from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealized capital appreciation (or depreciation), or investment income such as dividends, interest, or rental income, or a combination of capital gain and income. 　The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. 　Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. 　When a low-risk investment is made, the return is also generally low. 　Similarly, high risk comes with a chance of high losses. 　Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to diversify their portfolio. 　Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname>Surname</a> 

<font size=3>
In some cultures, a surname, family name, or last name is the portion of one's personal name that indicates one's family, tribe or community. 　Practices vary by culture. 　The family name may be placed at either the start of a person's full name, as the forename, or at the end; the number of surnames given to an individual also varies. 　As the surname can indicate genetic inheritance,[citation needed] all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations; for example, a woman might marry and have a child, but later remarry and have another child by a different father, and as such both children could have different surnames. 　It is common to see two or more words in a surname, such as in compound surnames. 　Compound surnames can be composed of separate names, such as in traditional Spanish culture, they can be hyphenated together, or may contain prefixes. 　Using names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. 　Examples of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. 　English surnames began as a way of identifying a certain aspect of that individual, such as by trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features, and were not necessarily inherited. 　By 1400 most English families, and those from Lowland Scotland, had adopted the use of hereditary surnames.

Funding is the act of providing resources to finance a need, program, or project. 　While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organization or company. 　Generally, this word is used when a firm uses its internal reserves to satisfy its necessity for cash, while the term financing is used when the firm acquires capital from external sources.　[citation needed] Sources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants, savings, subsidies, and taxes. 　Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants that have no direct requirement for return of investment are described as "soft funding" or "crowdfunding". 　Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity ownership in a company for capital investment via an online funding portal per the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (alternately, the "JOBS Act of 2012") (U.S.) is known as equity crowdfunding. 　Funds can be allocated for either short-term or long-term purposes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal>Canal</a> 

<font size=3>
Canals or artificial waterways are waterways or engineered channels built for drainage management (e.g. flood control and irrigation) or for conveyancing water transport vehicles (e.g. water taxi). 　They carry free, calm surface flow under atmospheric pressure, and can be thought of as artificial rivers. 　In most cases, a canal has a series of dams and locks that create reservoirs of low speed current flow. 　These reservoirs are referred to as slack water levels, often just called levels. 　A canal can be called a navigation canal when it parallels a natural river and shares part of the latter's discharges and drainage basin, and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its stretches of slack water levels while staying in its valley. 　A canal can cut across a drainage divide atop a ridge, generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. 　The best-known example of such a canal is the Panama Canal. 　Many canals have been built at elevations, above valleys and other waterways. 　Canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination such as a city where water is needed. 　The Roman Empire's aqueducts were such water supply canals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger>Anger</a> 

<font size=3>
Anger, also known as wrath or rage, is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and non-cooperative response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat. 　A person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects, such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. 　Some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the fight or flight response. 　Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force. 　The English word originally comes from the term anger from the Old Norse language. 　Anger can have many physical and mental consequences. 　The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression. 　Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown. 　While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them", psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability. 　Modern psychologists view anger as a normal, natural, and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has functional value for survival. 　Uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well-being and negatively impact those around them. 　While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger. 　The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck>Truck</a> 

<font size=3>
A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. 　Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle. 　Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles. 　Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators. 　In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a "straight truck" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a "tractor". 　The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico. 　The market-share of electrically powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks. 　In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture>Agriculture</a> 

<font size=3>
Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products. 　Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. 　While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. 　Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. 　Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. 　In the twentieth century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output. 　Today, small farms produce about a third of the world’s food, but large farms are prevalent. 　The largest one percent of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares and operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland. 　Nearly 40 percent of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares. 　However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than two hectares and take up only around 12 percent of all agricultural land. 　The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). 　Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. 　Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food, 32 million tonnes of natural fibres and 4 billion m3 of wood. 　However, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level. 　Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. 　Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. 　Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. 　Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. 　Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian>Brian</a> 

<font size=3>
Brian (sometimes spelled Bryan in English) is a male given name of Irish and Breton origin, as well as a surname of Occitan origin. 　It is common in the English-speaking world. 　It is possible that the name is derived from an Old Celtic word meaning "high" or "noble". 　For example, the element bre means "hill"; which could be transferred to mean "eminence" or "exalted one". 　The name is quite popular in Ireland, on account of Brian Boru, a 10th-century High King of Ireland. 　The name was also quite popular in East Anglia during the Middle Ages. 　This is because the name was introduced to England by Bretons following the Norman Conquest. 　Bretons also settled in Ireland along with the Normans in the 12th century, and 'their' name was mingled with the 'Irish' version. 　Also, in the north-west of England, the 'Irish' name was introduced by Scandinavian settlers from Ireland. 　Within the Gaelic speaking areas of Scotland, the name was at first only used by professional families of Irish origin. 　It was the fourth most popular male name in England and Wales in 1934, but a sharp decline followed over the remainder of the 20th century and by 1994 it had fallen out of the top 100. 　It retained its popularity in the United States for longer; its most popular period there was from 1968 to 1979 when it consistently ranked between eighth and tenth. 　The name has become increasingly popular in South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, since the early 1990s. 　The surname Brian is sometimes an English and Irish variant spelling of the surname Bryan. 　The English and French surname Brian is sometimes derived from the personal Celtic personal name shown above. 　The surname Brian can also sometimes be a French surname; derived from the Old Occitan word brian, meaning "maggot" and used as a nickname. 　Variants of the name include Briant, Brien, Bran, Brion, Bryan, Bryant, Brjánn (in Icelandic) and Bryon. 　Variant spellings such as "Brien" are sometimes used as female given names, especially among members of the Irish diaspora. 　In Latin America, the phonetic spelling “Brayan” is often used, associated with working-class parents aspiring to a higher socioeconomic status associated with Anglo-American culture, and mocked for that reason on social media.

<font size=3>
Comparison or comparing is the act of evaluating two or more things by determining the relevant, comparable characteristics of each thing, and then determining which characteristics of each are similar to the other, which are different, and to what degree. 　Where characteristics are different, the differences may then be evaluated to determine which thing is best suited for a particular purpose. 　The description of similarities and differences found between the two things is also called a comparison. 　Comparison can take many distinct forms, varying by field: To compare is to bring two or more things together (physically or in contemplation) and to examine them systematically, identifying similarities and differences among them. 　Comparison has a different meaning within each framework of study. 　Any exploration of the similarities or differences of two or more units is a comparison. 　In the most limited sense, it consists of comparing two units isolated from each other. 　To compare things, they must have characteristics that are similar enough in relevant ways to merit comparison. 　If two things are too different to compare in a useful way, an attempt to compare them is colloquially referred to in English as "comparing apples and oranges." 　Comparison is widely used in society, in science and in the arts.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota>Minnesota</a> 

<font size=3>
Minnesota (/ˌmɪnɪˈsoʊtə/ (listen)) is a state in the Upper Midwestern region of the United States. 　It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents. 　Minnesota is home to western prairies, now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. 　Roughly a third of the state is covered in forests, and it is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water covering at least ten acres. 　More than 60% of Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the "Twin Cities", the state's main political, economic, and cultural hub. 　With a population of about 3.7 million, the Twin Cities is the 16th largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the state include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud. 　Minnesota, which gets its name from the Dakota language, has been inhabited by various indigenous peoples since the Woodland period of the 11th century BCE. 　Between roughly 200 and 500 CE, two areas of the indigenous Hopewell tradition emerged: the Laurel complex in the north, and Trempealeau Hopewell in the Mississippi River Valley in the south. 　The Upper Mississippian culture, consisting of the Oneota people and other Siouan speakers, emerged around 1000 CE and lasted through the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. 　French explorers and missionaries were the earliest Europeans to enter the region, encountering the Dakota, Ojibwe, and various Anishinaabe tribes. 　Much of what is now Minnesota formed part of the vast French holding of Louisiana, which the United States purchased in 1803. 　After several territorial reorganizations, the Minnesota Territory was admitted to the Union as the 32nd state in 1858. 　Minnesota's official motto, L'Étoile du Nord, is the only state motto in French; meaning "The Star of the North", it was adopted shortly after statehood and reflects both the state's early French explorers and its position as the northernmost state in the contiguous U.S. As part of the American frontier, Minnesota attracted settlers and homesteaders from across the country, with its growth initially centered on timber, agriculture, and railroad construction. 　Into the early 20th century, European immigrants arrived in significant numbers, particularly from Scandinavia, Germany, and Central Europe; many were linked to the failed revolutions of 1848, which partly influenced the state's development as a center of labor and social activism. 　Minnesota's rapid industrialization and urbanization precipitated major social, economic, and political changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the state was at the forefront of labor rights, women's suffrage, and political reform. 　Minnesota is considered Democratic-leaning, having voted for every Democratic presidential nominee since 1976, longer than any other U.S. state. 　Since the late 20th century, the core of Minnesota's economy has diversified, shifting from traditional industries such as agriculture and resource extraction to services, finance, and health care; it is consequently one of the richest in terms of GDP and per capita income. 　The state is home to 11 federally recognized Native American reservations (seven Ojibwe, four Dakota), and remains a center of Scandinavian and German cultures with an influence of Lutheranism. 　In more recent decades, Minnesota has become more multicultural, driven by both larger domestic migration and immigration from Latin America, Asia, the Horn of Africa, and the Middle East; the state has the nation's largest population of Somali Americans and second largest Hmong population. 　Minnesota's standard of living and level of education are among the highest in the U.S., and it is ranked among the best states in metrics such as employment, median income, safety, and governance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller>Miller</a> 

<font size=3>
A miller is a person who operates a mill, a machine to grind a grain (for example corn or wheat) to make flour. 　Milling is among the oldest of human occupations. 　"Miller", "Milne" and other variants are common surnames, as are their equivalents in other languages around the world ("Melnyk" in Russian, Belorussian & Ukrainian, "Meunier" in French, "Müller" or "Mueller" in German, "Mulder" and "Molenaar" in Dutch, "Molnár" in Hungarian, "Molinero" in Spanish, "Molinaro" or "Molinari" in Italian etc.). 　Milling existed in hunter-gatherer communities, and later millers were important to the development of agriculture. 　The materials ground by millers are often foodstuffs and particularly grain. 　The physical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its nutrients and saves wear on the teeth. 　Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered form, such as building materials, may be processed by a miller.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock>Clock</a> 

<font size=3>
A clock or a timepiece is a device used to measure and indicate time. 　The clock is one of the oldest human inventions, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units such as the day, the lunar month and the year. 　Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia. 　Some predecessors to the modern clock may be considered as "clocks" that are based on movement in nature: A sundial shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface. 　There is a range of duration timers, a well-known example being the hourglass. 　Water clocks, along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments. 　A major advance occurred with the invention of the verge escapement, which made possible the first mechanical clocks around 1300 in Europe, which kept time with oscillating timekeepers like balance wheels. 　Traditionally, in horology (the study of timekeeping), the term clock was used for a striking clock, while a clock that did not strike the hours audibly was called a timepiece. 　This distinction is no longer made. 　Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are usually not referred to as clocks. 　Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century. 　During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. 　The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the pendulum clock by Christiaan Huygens. 　A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. 　The mechanism of a timepiece with a series of gears driven by a spring or weights is referred to as clockwork; the term is used by extension for a similar mechanism not used in a timepiece. 　The electric clock was patented in 1840, and electronic clocks were introduced in the 20th century, becoming widespread with the development of small battery-powered semiconductor devices. 　The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a harmonic oscillator, a physical object (resonator) that vibrates or oscillates at a particular frequency. 　This object can be a pendulum, a tuning fork, a quartz crystal, or the vibration of electrons in atoms as they emit microwaves, the last method of which is so precise that it serves as the definition of the second. 　Clocks have different ways of displaying the time. 　Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional clock face, with moving hands. 　Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. 　Two numbering systems are in use: 12-hour time notation and 24-hour notation. 　Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and LCD, LED, or VFD displays. 　For the blind and for use over telephones, speaking clocks state the time audibly in words. 　There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement>Retirement</a> 

<font size=3>
Retirement is the withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from one's active working life. 　A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours or workload. 　Many people choose to retire when they are elderly or incapable of doing their job due to health reasons. 　People may also retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their positions. 　In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. 　Previously, low life expectancy, lack of social security and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until their death. 　Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889. 　Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, funded by employers or the state. 　In many poorer countries, there is no support for the elderly beyond that provided through the family. 　Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies; hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. 　In many Western countries, this is a right embodied in national constitutions. 　An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting>Broadcasting</a> 

<font size=3>
Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. 　Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. 　Before this, most implementations of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. 　The term broadcasting evolved from its use as the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about. 　It was later adopted for describing the widespread distribution of information by printed materials or by telegraph. 　Examples applying it to "one-to-many" radio transmissions of an individual station to multiple listeners appeared as early as 1898. 　Over the air broadcasting is usually associated with radio and television, though more recently, both radio and television transmissions have begun to be distributed by cable (cable television). 　The receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset; the point is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology and equipment (e.g., a radio or television set) can receive the signal. 　The field of broadcasting includes both government-managed services such as public radio, community radio and public television, and private commercial radio and commercial television. 　The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, part 97 defines "broadcasting" as "transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed". 　Private or two-way telecommunications transmissions do not qualify under this definition. 　For example, amateur ("ham") and citizens band (CB) radio operators are not allowed to broadcast. 　As defined, "transmitting" and "broadcasting" are not the same. 　Transmission of radio and television programs from a radio or television station to home receivers by radio waves is referred to as "over the air" (OTA) or terrestrial broadcasting and in most countries requires a broadcasting license. 　Transmissions using a wire or cable, like cable television (which also retransmits OTA stations with their consent), are also considered broadcasts but do not necessarily require a license (though in some countries, a license is required). 　In the 2000s, transmissions of television and radio programs via streaming digital technology have increasingly been referred to as broadcasting as well.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty>Dynasty</a> 

<font size=3>
A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a monarchical system, but sometimes also appearing in republics. 　A dynasty may also be referred to as a "house", "family" or "clan", among others. 　Historians periodize the histories of many states and civilizations, such as Ancient Iran (3200 – 539 BC), Ancient Egypt (3100 – 30 BC), Ancient and Imperial China (2070 BC – AD 1912) and Chola Dynasty (300 BC – AD 1279), using a framework of successive dynasties. 　As such, the term "dynasty" may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned. 　Before the 18th century, most dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as those that follow the Frankish Salic law. 　In polities where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband's family name. 　This has changed in all of Europe's remaining monarchies, where succession law and conventions have maintained dynastic names de jure through a female. 　Dynastic politics has declined over time, owing to a decline in monarchy as a form of government, a rise in democracy, and a reduction within democracies of elected members from dynastic families.

In Euclidean geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. 　Angles formed by two rays lie in the plane that contains the rays. 　Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes. 　These are called dihedral angles. 　Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection. 　Angle is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of a rotation. 　This measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius. 　In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. 　In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.

<font size=3>
Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraïna, pronounced [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe. 　It is the second-largest European country after Russia, which it borders to the east and northeast. 　Ukraine covers approximately 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 sq mi). 　Prior to the ongoing Russian invasion, it was the eighth-most populous country in Europe, with a population of around 41 million people. 　It is also bordered by Belarus to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast. 　Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city. 　Ukraine's state language is Ukrainian; Russian is also widely spoken, especially in the east and south. 　During the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later became a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century. 　The state eventually disintegrated into rival regional powers and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. 　The area was then contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of external powers for the next 600 years, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Tsardom of Russia. 　The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian Empire. 　Ukrainian nationalism developed, and following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic was formed. 　The Bolsheviks consolidated control over much of the former empire and established the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union when it was formed in 1922. 　In the early 1930s, millions of Ukrainians died in the Holodomor, a man-made famine. 　During World War II, Ukraine was devastated by the German occupation. 　Ukraine gained independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union dissolved, and declared itself neutral. 　A new constitution was adopted in 1996. 　A series of mass demonstrations, known as the Euromaidan, led to the establishment of a new government in 2014 after a revolution. 　Russia then unilaterally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula; and pro-Russian unrest culminated in a war between Russian-backed separatists and government forces in eastern Ukraine. 　Russia later launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 　Since the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine has continued to seek closer ties with the European Union and NATO. 　Ukraine is a unitary state with a semi-presidential system. 　It is a developing country, ranking 77th on the Human Development Index. 　Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe by nominal GDP per capita, and corruption remains a significant issue. 　However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was one of the largest grain exporters in the world. 　It is a founding member of the United Nations, as well as a member of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, and the OSCE. 　It is in the process of joining the European Union and has submitted an application for NATO membership.

<font size=3>
Mining is the extraction of valuable geological materials from the Earth and other astronomical objects. 　Mining is required to obtain most materials that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. 　Ores recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. 　Ore must be a rock or mineral that contains valuable constituent, can be extracted or mined and sold for profit. 　including a valuable mineral Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water. 　Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation or restoration of the land after the mine is closed. 　Mining materials are often obtained from ore bodies, lodes, veins, seams, reefs, or placer deposits. 　The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is dependent on investment, labor, energy, refine and transportation cost. 　Mining operations can create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. 　Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact; however, the outsized role of mining in generating business for often rural, remote or economically depressed communities means that governments often fail to fully enforce such regulations. 　Work safety has long been a concern as well, and where enforced, modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines. 　Unregulated or poorly regulated mining, especially in developing economies, frequently contributes to local human rights violations and resource conflicts.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics>Statistics</a> 

<font size=3>
Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. "description of a state, a country") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. 　In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. 　Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 　Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. 　When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. 　Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. 　An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. 　In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. 　Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). 　Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. 　Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena. 　A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. 　A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. 　Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. 　Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving a "false negative"). 　Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. 　Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. 　Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. 　The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

<font size=3>
Melbourne (/ˈmɛlbərn/ (listen) MEL-bərn; Boonwurrung/Woiwurrung: Narrm or Naarm) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. 　Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2 (3,858 sq mi) metropolitan area known as Greater Melbourne, comprising an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used specifically for the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area. 　The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley, the Dandenong and Macedon Ranges. 　It has a population over 5 million (19% of the population of Australia, as per 2021 census), mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its inhabitants are commonly referred to as "Melburnians". 　The area of Melbourne has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans. 　Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land encompassing Melbourne are the Boonwurrung, Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples. 　A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip, then part of the British colony of New South Wales, in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), that Melbourne was founded. 　It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837, and named after the then British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. 　In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria. 　During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises. 　After the federation of Australia in 1901, it served as the interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927. 　Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 32nd globally in the March 2022 Global Financial Centres Index. 　Melbourne is home to many of Australia's best-known landmarks, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. 　Noted for its cultural heritage, the city gave rise to Australian rules football, Australian impressionism and Australian cinema, and has more recently been recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre. 　It hosts major annual international events, such as the Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open, and also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics. 　Melbourne consistently ranked as the world's most liveable city for much of the 2010s. 　Melbourne Airport, also known as the Tullamarine Airport, is the second-busiest airport in Australia, and the Port of Melbourne is the nation's busiest seaport. 　Its main metropolitan rail terminus is Flinders Street station and its main regional rail and road coach terminus is Southern Cross station. 　It also has Australia's most extensive freeway network and the largest urban tram network in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment>Experiment</a> 

<font size=3>
An experiment is a procedure carried out to support or refute a hypothesis, or determine the efficacy or likelihood of something previously untried. 　Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. 　Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. 　There also exist natural experimental studies. 　A child may carry out basic experiments to understand how things fall to the ground, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. 　Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. 　Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time. 　Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). 　Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences. 　Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. 　This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. 　Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. 　Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. 　In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variables.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank>Tank</a> 

<font size=3>
A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. 　Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. 　They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. 　Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. 　They have heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. 　The use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. 　These features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against heavier weapons, although anti-tank weapons used in 2022, some of them man-portable, have demonstrated the ability to destroy older generations of tanks with single shots),[disputed – discuss] all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. 　Fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armoured warfare. 　Until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-, cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks). 　Some being larger and very heavily armoured and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armoured, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. 　These smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. 　The smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily armoured tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

<font size=3>
Missouri is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　Ranking 21st in land area, it is bordered by eight states (tied for the most with Tennessee): Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska to the west. 　In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. 　The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. 　With more than six million residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. 　The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City. 　Humans have inhabited what is now Missouri for at least 12,000 years. 　The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. 　When European explorers arrived in the 17th century, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. 　The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. 　Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. 　After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. 　Americans from the Upland South, including enslaved African Americans, rushed into the new Missouri Territory. 　Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. 　Many from Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. 　Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland. 　Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. 　The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri. 　As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. 　After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. 　Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. 　Missouri's culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. 　It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. 　The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond. 　Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. 　It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. 　Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. 　Well-known Missourians include Chuck Berry, Sheryl Crow, Walt Disney, Edwin Hubble, Nelly, Brad Pitt, Harry S. Truman, and Mark Twain. 　Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. 　Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis. 　Missouri has been called the "Mother of the West" and the "Cave State", but its most famous nickname is the "Show Me State".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar>Familiar</a> 

<font size=3>
In European folklore of the medieval and early modern periods, familiars (sometimes referred to as familiar spirits) were believed to be supernatural entities that would assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic. 　According to records of the time, those alleging to have had contact with familiar spirits reported that they could manifest as numerous forms, usually as an animal, but sometimes as a human or humanoid figure, and were described as "clearly defined, three-dimensional... forms, vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound", as opposed to descriptions of ghosts with their "smoky, undefined form[s]". 　When they served witches, they were often thought to be malevolent, but when working for cunning folk they were often considered benevolent (although there was some ambiguity in both cases). 　The former were often categorized as demons, while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies. 　The main purpose of familiars was to serve the witch, providing protection for them as they came into their new powers. 　Since the 20th century some magical practitioners, including adherents of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, use the concept of familiars, due to their association with older forms of magic. 　These contemporary practitioners use pets or wildlife, or believe that invisible versions of familiars act as magical aides.

<font size=3>
Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ (listen), other variants) is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. 　It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains, as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. 　Colorado is the eighth most extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. 　The 2020 United States census enumerated the population of Colorado at 5,773,714, an increase of 14.80% since the 2010 United States census. 　The region has been inhabited by Native Americans and their ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. 　The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. 　"Colorado" is the Spanish adjective meaning "ruddy", the color of the Fountain Formation outcroppings found up and down the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. 　The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. 　Colorado is nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state one century after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. 　Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, and Utah to the west, and touches Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. 　Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. 　Colorado is one of the Mountain States, and is a part of the western and is often considered to be part of the southwestern United States. 　Denver is the capital of and most populous city in Colorado. 　Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although the antiquated "Coloradoan" is occasionally used. 　Major parts of the economy include government and defense, mining, agriculture, tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing. 　With increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability, Colorado's agriculture, forestry, and tourism economies are expected to be heavily affected by climate change. 　Colorado is one of the most educated, developed, and wealthiest states, ranking 3rd in percentage of population 25 and over with a bachelor's degree and 8th in percentage of population 25 and over with an advanced degree, 9th on the American Human Development Index, 8th in per capita income and 9th in median household income.

<font size=3>
Kansas (/ˈkænzəs/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States. 　Its capital is Topeka, and its largest city is Wichita. 　Kansas is a landlocked state bordered by Nebraska to the north; Missouri to the east; Oklahoma to the south; and Colorado to the west. 　Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. 　The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean "people of the (south) wind" although this was probably not the term's original meaning. 　For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. 　Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. 　Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. 　The first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth. 　The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate. 　When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. 　Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as Bleeding Kansas. 　The abolitionists prevailed, and on January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state, hence the unofficial nickname "The Free State". 　By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. 　Kansas, which has an area of 82,278 square miles (213,100 square kilometers) is the 15th-largest state by area and is the 36th most-populous of the 50 states, with a population of 2,940,865 according to the 2020 census. 　Residents of Kansas are called Kansans. 　Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest point at 4,039 feet (1,231 meters).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem>Theorem</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved, or can be proved. 　The proof of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system to establish that the theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems. 　In the mainstream of mathematics, the axioms and the inference rules are commonly left implicit, and, in this case, they are almost always those of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, or of a less powerful theory, such as Peano arithmetic. 　A notable exception is Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which involves the Grothendieck universes whose existence requires the addition of a new axiom to the set theory. 　Generally, an assertion that is explicitly called a theorem is a proved result that is not an immediate consequence of other known theorems. 　Moreover, many authors qualify as theorems only the most important results, and use the terms lemma, proposition and corollary for less important theorems. 　In mathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. 　In this context, statements become well-formed formulas of some formal language. 　A theory consists of some basis statements called axioms, and some deducing rules (sometimes included in the axioms). 　The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms by using the deducing rules. 　This formalization led to proof theory, which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. 　In particular, Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that every consistent theory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory). 　As the axioms are often abstractions of properties of the physical world, theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, but in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental, the justification of the truth of a theorem is purely deductive.

<font size=3>
Queensland (locally /ˈkwiːnzlænd/ KWEENZ-land) is a state situated in northeastern Australia, and is the second-largest and third-most populous of the Australian states. 　It is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, southwest and south respectively. 　To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean; to its north is the Torres Strait, separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea. 　With an area of 1,852,642 square kilometres (715,309 sq mi), Queensland is the world's sixth-largest sub-national entity; it is larger than all but 15 countries. 　Due to its size, Queensland's geographical features and climates are diverse, including tropical rainforests, rivers, coral reefs, mountain ranges and sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior. 　Queensland has a population of over 5.2 million, concentrated along the coast and particularly in South East Queensland. 　The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city. 　Ten of Australia's thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, with the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. 　The state's population is multicultural, with 28.9% of inhabitants being immigrants. 　Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. 　Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. 　In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. 　In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. 　Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. 　Queensland was separated from New South Wales on 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day), thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government, named in honour of Queen Victoria. 　Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. 　Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration. 　Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education, insurance and banking. 　Nicknamed the Sunshine State for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, Great Barrier Reef and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state's economy.

<font size=3>
A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through surrounding soil, earth or rock, and enclosed except for the entrance and exit, commonly at each end. 　A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods. 　A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic, for rail traffic, or for a canal. 　The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel. 　Some tunnels are used as sewers or aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations. 　Utility tunnels are used for routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment. 　Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, or by civilians for smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people. 　Special tunnels, such as wildlife crossings, are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely. 　Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror>Mirror</a> 

<font size=3>
A mirror or looking glass is an object that reflects an image. 　Light that bounces off a mirror will show an image of whatever is in front of it, when focused through the lens of the eye or a camera. 　Mirrors reverse the direction of the image in an equal yet opposite angle from which the light shines upon it. 　This allows the viewer to see themselves or objects behind them, or even objects that are at an angle from them but out of their field of view, such as around a corner. 　Natural mirrors have existed since prehistoric times, such as the surface of water, but people have been manufacturing mirrors out of a variety of materials for thousands of years, like stone, metals, and glass. 　In modern mirrors, metals like silver or aluminium are often used due to their high reflectivity, applied as a thin coating on glass because of its naturally smooth and very hard surface. 　A mirror is a wave reflector. 　Light consists of waves, and when light waves reflect from the flat surface of a mirror, those waves retain the same degree of curvature and vergence, in an equal yet opposite direction, as the original waves. 　This allows the waves to form an image when they are focused through a lens, just as if the waves had originated from the direction of the mirror. 　The light can also be pictured as rays (imaginary lines radiating from the light source, that are always perpendicular to the waves). 　These rays are reflected at an equal yet opposite angle from which they strike the mirror (incident light). 　This property, called specular reflection, distinguishes a mirror from objects that diffuse light, breaking up the wave and scattering it in many directions (such as flat-white paint). 　Thus, a mirror can be any surface in which the texture or roughness of the surface is smaller (smoother) than the wavelength of the waves. 　When looking at a mirror, one will see a mirror image or reflected image of objects in the environment, formed by light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes. 　This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behind the mirror, or (sometimes) in front of it. 　When the surface is not flat, a mirror may behave like a reflecting lens. 　A plane mirror yields a real-looking undistorted image, while a curved mirror may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various ways, while keeping the lines, contrast, sharpness, colors, and other image properties intact. 　A mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, such as during personal grooming; hence the old-fashioned name "looking glass". 　This use, which dates from prehistory, overlaps with uses in decoration and architecture. 　Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible because of obstructions; examples include rear-view mirrors in vehicles, security mirrors in or around buildings, and dentist's mirrors. 　Mirrors are also used in optical and scientific apparatus such as telescopes, lasers, cameras, periscopes, and industrial machinery. 　According to superstitions breaking a mirror is said to bring seven years of bad luck. 　The terms "mirror" and "reflector" can be used for objects that reflect any other types of waves. 　An acoustic mirror reflects sound waves. 　Objects such as walls, ceilings, or natural rock-formations may produce echos, and this tendency often becomes a problem in acoustical engineering when designing houses, auditoriums, or recording studios. 　Acoustic mirrors may be used for applications such as parabolic microphones, atmospheric studies, sonar, and seafloor mapping. 　An atomic mirror reflects matter waves and can be used for atomic interferometry and atomic holography.

<font size=3>
Collaboration (from Latin com- "with" + laborare "to labor", "to work") is the process of two or more people, entities or organizations working together to complete a task or achieve a goal. 　Collaboration is similar to cooperation. 　Most collaboration requires leadership,[vague] although the form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group. 　Teams that work collaboratively often access greater resources, recognition and rewards when facing competition for finite resources. 　Structured methods of collaboration encourage introspection of behavior and communication. 　Such methods aim to increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem-solving. 　Collaboration is present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a common use of the term. 　In its applied sense, "(a) collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome."
