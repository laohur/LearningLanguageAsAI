<font size=3>
In botany, seed is an undeveloped plant embryo and food reserve enclosed in a protective outer covering. 　More generally, the term "seed" means anything that can be sown, which may include seed and husk or tuber. 　Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after the embryo sac is fertilized by sperm from pollen, forming a zygote. 　The embryo within a seed develops from the zygote, forming a seed coat around the ovule, and grows within the mother plant to a certain size before growth is halted. 　The formation of the seed is a part of the process of reproduction in seed plants (spermatophytes). 　Other plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. 　Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates. 　In the flowering plants, the ovary ripens into a fruit which contains the seed and serves to disseminate it. 　Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry fruits. 　Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. 　Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. 　Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.

<font size=3>
Look up arrest in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　An arrest is the act of apprehending and taking a person into custody (legal protection or control), usually because the person has been suspected of or observed committing a crime. 　After being taken into custody, the person can be questioned further and/or charged. 　An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system, sometimes it is also done after a court warrant for the arrest. 　Police and various other officers have powers of arrest. 　In some places, a citizen's arrest is permitted; for example in England and Wales, any person can arrest "anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence", although certain conditions must be met before taking such action. 　Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID. 　As a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of probable cause in the United States. 　Furthermore, in most democracies, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and 24 or 48 hours in the United States and France) before the detained person must be either charged or released.

<font size=3>
A critic is a person who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. 　Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. 　Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. 　They may also include a positive or negative personal response. 　Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. 　Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. 　Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. 　In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components. 　Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. 　Influential critics of art, music, theater and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. 　One very famous example is John Ruskin's Seven Lamps of Architecture and The Stones of Venice. 　Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. 　For instance, they may take a feminist or Freudian perspective. 　Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. 　When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "pundits" instead of critics. 　Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails subjectivity. 　An established critic can play a powerful role as a public arbiter of taste or opinion. 　Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

<font size=3>
A songwriter is a musician who professionally composes musical compositions or writes lyrics for songs, or both. 　The writer of the music for a song can be called a composer, although this term tends to be used mainly in the classical music genre and film scoring. 　A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. 　The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. 　For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. 　Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. 　Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have external publishers. 　The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees, college diplomas and "rock schools". 　Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are significant for modern songwriters. 　Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. 　Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. 　The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. 　This is governed by international copyright law. 　Songwriters can be employed in a variety of different ways. 　They may exclusively write lyrics or compose music alongside another artist, present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. 　Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters. 　Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. 　Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.

<font size=3>
Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/; Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō, [toːkʲoː] (listen)), officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital and most populous city of Japan. 　Formerly known as Edo, its metropolitan area (13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles) is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018[update]; the city proper has a population of 13.99 million people. 　Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. 　Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and is the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. 　Originally a fishing village named Edo, the city became politically prominent in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. 　By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world with a population of over one million people. 　Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, which was renamed "Tokyo" (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). 　Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. 　Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion efforts, going on to lead the Japanese economic miracle. 　Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands. 　Tokyo is the second-largest urban economy worldwide by gross domestic product after New York City, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　It is also Japan's leading business hub as part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. 　As of 2021[update], Tokyo is home to 37 companies of the Fortune Global 500. 　In 2020, the city ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York City, London, and Shanghai. 　Tokyo is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree, and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (located in Kasukabe, Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo). 　The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia. 　Recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world, Tokyo was tied fourth with Wellington in the 2021 Global Livability Ranking. 　The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics (postponed; held in 2021), and three summits of the G7 (in 1979, 1986, and 1993). 　Tokyo is an international research and development hub and is likewise represented by several major universities, most notably the University of Tokyo. 　Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's high-speed railway network, the Shinkansen; Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is also the world's busiest train station. 　Notable special wards of Tokyo include: Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief>Belief</a> 
<font size=3>
A belief is a subjective attitude that something or proposition is true. 　In epistemology, philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either true or false. 　To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition "snow is white". 　However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. 　For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. 　Moreover, beliefs need not be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking "snow is white"), but can instead be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert "snow is white"). 　There are various ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone's actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). 　Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief ("either we have a belief or we don't have a belief") with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence ("there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief"). 　Beliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. 　Notable examples include: "What is the rational way to revise one's beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?", "Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I'm holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?", "How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?", and "Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting>Hunting</a> 
<font size=3>
Hunting is the human practice of seeking, pursuing, capturing, or killing wildlife or feral animals. 　The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to exploit the animal's body for food (i.e. meat) and useful animal products (fur/hide, bone/tusks, horn/antler, etc.), for recreation/taxidermy (see trophy hunting), although it may also be done for non-exploitative reasons such as removing predators dangerous to humans or domestic animals (e.g. wolf hunting), to eliminate pests and nuisance animals that damage crops/livestock/poultry or spread diseases (see varminting), for trade/tourism (see safari), or for ecological conservation against overpopulation and invasive species. 　Recreationally hunted species are generally referred to as the game, and are usually mammals and birds. 　A person participating in a hunt is a hunter or (less commonly) huntsman; a natural area used for hunting is called a game reserve; an experienced hunter who helps organize a hunt and/or manage the game reserve is known as a gamekeeper. 　Many non-human animals also hunt (see predation) as part of their feeding and parental behaviors, sometimes in quantities exceeding immediate dietary needs. 　The one that does the hunting is the predator, and the one being hunted is the prey. 　Hunting activities by humans arose in Homo erectus or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago. 　Hunting has become deeply embedded in various human cultures and was once an important part of the rural economies—classified by economists as part of primary production alongside forestry, agriculture and fishery. 　Modern regulations (see game law) distinguish lawful hunting activities from illegal poaching, which involves the unauthorized and unregulated killing, trapping or capture of animals. 　Apart from food provision, hunting can be a means of population control. 　Hunting advocates state that regulated hunting can be a necessary component of modern wildlife management, for example to help maintain a healthy proportion of animal populations within an environment's ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as natural predators are absent or insufficient, or to provide funding for breeding programs and maintenance of natural reserves and conservation parks. 　However, excessive hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals. 　Some animal rights and anti-hunting activists regard hunting as a cruel, perverse and unnecessary blood sport. 　Certain hunting practices, such as canned hunts and ludicrously paid/bribed trophy tours (especially to poor countries), are considered unethical and exploitative even by some hunters. 　Marine mammals such as whales and pinnipeds are also targets of hunting, both recreationally and commercially, often with heated controversies regarding the morality, ethics and legality of such practices. 　The pursuit, harvesting or catch and release of fish and aquatic cephalopods and crustaceans is called fishing, which however is widely accepted and not commonly categorised as a form of hunting, even though it essentially is. 　It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, birdwatching, or scientific-research activities which involve tranquilizing or tagging of animals, although green hunting is still called so. 　The practices of netting or trapping insects and other arthropods for trophy collection, or the foraging or gathering of plants and mushrooms, are also not regarded as hunting. 　Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor for searching and obtaining something, as in "treasure hunting", "bargain hunting", "hunting for votes" and even "hunting down" corruption and waste.

<font size=3>
An assault is the act of illegally committing physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action. 　It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both. 　Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law. 　Traditionally, common law legal systems have separate definitions for assault and battery. 　When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. 　Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into a single crime called "assault and battery", which then became widely referred to as "assault". 　The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. 　The legal systems of civil law and Scots law have never distinguished assault from battery. 　Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. 　In the United States, an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony. 　In England and Wales and Australia, it can be charged as either common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) or grievous bodily harm (GBH). 　Canada also has a three-tier system: assault, assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault. 　Separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults, affray and assaulting a police officer. 　Assault may overlap with an attempted crime; for example an assault may be charged as an attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill.

A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. 　Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity which had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell. 　Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. 　Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens. 　Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph. 　All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.

<font size=3>
Surgery is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a person to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function, appearance, or to repair unwanted ruptured areas. 　The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, operation, or simply "surgery". 　In this context, the verb "operate" means to perform surgery. 　The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. 　The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. 　A surgeon is a person who practices surgery and a surgeon's assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. 　A surgical team is made up of the surgeon, the surgeon's assistant, an anaesthetist, a circulating nurse and a surgical technologist. 　Surgery usually spans from minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. 　The term "surgery" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone>Bone</a> 
<font size=3>
A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. 　Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. 　Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. 　They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions. 　Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialized connective tissue. 　It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. 　Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. 　Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. 　Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. 　The mineralized matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. 　Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. 　Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. 　In the human body at birth, there are approximately 300 bones present; many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. 　The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear. 　The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον ("osteon"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. 　In anatomical terminology, including the Terminologia Anatomica international standard, the word for a bone is os (for example, os breve, os longum, os sesamoideum).

<font size=3>
Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. 　Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. 　The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals. 　Most animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. 　Water is required for many physiological processes. 　Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity>Popularity</a> 
<font size=3>
In sociology, popularity is how much a person, idea, place, item or other concept is either liked or accorded status by other people. 　Liking can be due to reciprocal liking, interpersonal attraction, and similar factors. 　Social status can be due to dominance, superiority, and similar factors. 　For example, a kind person may be considered likable and therefore more popular than another person, and a wealthy person may be considered superior and therefore more popular than another person. 　There are two primary types of interpersonal popularity: perceived and sociometric. 　Perceived popularity is measured by asking people who the most popular or socially important people in their social group are. 　Sociometric popularity is measured by objectively measuring the number of connections a person has to others in the group. 　A person can have high perceived popularity without having high sociometric popularity, and vice versa. 　According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the Radboud University Nijmegen, "Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a group and having influence on it."

<font size=3>
Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food, typically to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and to allow for growth. 　Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. 　Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. 　For humans, eating is an activity of daily living. 　Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. 　This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to hunger or famine, as part of a diet or as religious fasting.
