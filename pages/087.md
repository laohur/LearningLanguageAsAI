Io (/ˈaɪ.oʊ/; Ancient Greek: Ἰώ [iːɔ̌ː]) was, in Greek mythology, one of the mortal lovers of Zeus. 　An Argive princess, she was an ancestor of many kings and heroes, such as Perseus, Cadmus, Heracles, Minos, Lynceus, Cepheus, and Danaus. 　The astronomer Simon Marius named a moon of Jupiter after Io in 1614. 　Because her brother was Phoroneus, Io is also known as Phoronis (an adjective form of Phoroneus: "Phoronean"). 　She was sometimes compared to the egyptian goddess Isis, whereas her Egyptian husband Telegonus was "Osiris".

<font size=3>
The Mini is a small, two-door, four-seat car, developed as ADO15, and produced by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors, from 1959 through 2000. 　Minus a brief hiatus, original Minis were built for four decades and sold during six, from the last year of the 1950s into the last year of the 20th century, over a single generation, as fastbacks, estates, and convertibles. 　The original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture. 　Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers. 　In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle. 　The front-wheel-drive, transverse-engine layout of the Mini was copied for other "supermini" designs including the Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat 127 (1971). 　The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs. 　This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. 　It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in England located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti) Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV). 　The Italian version of the Mini which was sold under the Innocenti marque was produced in Lambrate, a district of Milan. 　The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates: the Mark II, the Clubman, and the Mark III. 　Within these was a series of variations, including an estate car, a pick-up truck, a van, and the Mini Moke, a jeep-like buggy. 　The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper "S", were successful as both race and rally cars, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965, and 1967. 　In 1966, the first-placed Mini (along with nine other cars) was disqualified after the finish, under a controversial decision that the car's headlights were against the rules. 　On its introduction in August 1959, the Mini was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor. 　The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962 and Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969. 　In 1980, it once again became the Austin Mini, and in 1988, just "Mini" (although the "Rover" badge was applied on some models exported to Japan). 　BMW acquired the Rover Group (formerly British Leyland) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the Mini name. 　Retrospectively, the car is known as the "Classic Mini" to distinguish it from the modern, BMW influenced MINI family of vehicles produced since 2000.

Shah (/ʃɑː/; Persian: شاه, Šâh [ʃɒːh], lit. 'king') is a royal title that was historically used by the leading figures of Iranian monarchies. 　It was also used by a variety of Persianate societies, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Kazakh Khanate, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, historical Afghan dynasties, and among Gurkhas. 　Rather than regarding himself as simply a king of the concurrent dynasty (i.e. European-style monarchies), each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah (شاهنشاه, Šâhanšâh, lit. 'King of Kings') or Padishah (پادشاه, Pâdešâh, lit. 'Master King') in the sense of a continuation of the original Persian Empire.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology>Theology</a> 
<font size=3>
Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine and, more broadly, of religious belief. 　It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. 　It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. 　Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and, in particular, to reveal themselves to humankind. 　While theology has turned into a secular field[according to whom?], religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship. 　Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. 　As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations. 　The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. 　Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. 　Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.

A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. 　Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. 　Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account. 　Under the feudal system, a Knight's fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land. 　A contingent fee is an attorney's fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney. 　A service fee, service charge, or surcharge is a fee added to a customer's bill. 　The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided. 　Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers' compensation insurance fees, and planning fees. 　UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel. 　Restaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Montana), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them. 　A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff. 　A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis>Dennis</a> 
<font size=3>
Dennis or Denis is a first or last name from the Greco-Roman name Dionysius, via one of the Christian saints named Dionysius. 　The name came from Dionysus, the Greek god of ecstatic states, particularly those produced by wine, which is sometimes said to be derived from the Greek Dios (Διός, "of Zeus") and Nysos or Nysa (Νῦσα), where the young god was raised. 　Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. 　He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace—as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater. 　Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites, such as those practiced in honor of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis near Athens. 　In the Thracian mysteries, he wears the "bassaris" or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. 　(See also Maenads.) 　A mediaeval Latinised form of the Anglo-Norman surname Le Denys was Dacus, which correctly meant Dacian, but when the Vikings were about was often used to mean "Danish" or "The Dane". 　The name became modernised as Denys, then later as Dennis. 　Alternative forms and spellings of the name include Denis, Denys, Dennys, Denish, Deon, Deonne, Deonte, and Dion, Dionice. 　Diminutive forms include Den, Dennoh, Deno, Denny, Deny and Deen. 　The name Sydenie (alternate spellings: Sydney or Sidney) may derive from a village in Normandy called Saint-Denis.　[citation needed] A medieval diminutive was Dye, from which the names Dyson and Tyson are derived.　[citation needed] Dennis is a very popular English, Irish and Danish name, common throughout the English-speaking world, and a very popular French name, common throughout the Francophone world. 　It is also common as a German, Italian, Dutch, Croatian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Brazilian, Bosnian, and Albanian name. 　Dionizy is the Polish version of the name, while Dionigi and Dionisio are the Italian versions of the name. 　The Irish name Donnchadh may be anglicised as Denis, but has a different origin and is in fact related to the name Duncan. 　Feminine versions of the name include: Denise, Denisa, Deni, Denice, Deniece, Dione, and Dionne.

<font size=3>
In Norse paganism, Freyja (Old Norse "(the) Lady") is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and seiðr (magic for seeing and influencing the future). 　Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisvíni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. 　By her husband Óðr, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. 　Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. 　Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja. 　Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. 　The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. 　Within Fólkvangr lies her hall, Sessrúmnir. 　Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. 　Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. 　She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. 　Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, Vanadís, and Valfreyja. 　Freyja is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story "Sörla þáttr"; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore. 　Scholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples. 　They have connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain, and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE "Isis" of the Suebi. 　In Scandinavia, Freyja's name frequently appears in the names of plants, especially in southern Sweden. 　Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. 　Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.

Adelaide (/ˈædɪleɪd/ (listen) AD-il-ayd; Kaurna: Tarntanya), is the capital city of South Australia, the state's largest city and the fifth-most populous city in Australia. 　"Adelaide" may refer to either Greater Adelaide (including the Adelaide Hills) or the Adelaide city centre. 　The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide. 　The Traditional Owners of the Adelaide region are the Kaurna people. 　The area of the city centre and surrounding parklands is called Tarndanya in the Kaurna language. 　Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. 　Its metropolitan area extends 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96 km (60 mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south. 　Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. 　Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens. 　Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout known as "Light's Vision", interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands. 　Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. 　Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third most populated city. 　It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the "City of Churches" due to its diversity of faiths. 　Today, Adelaide is known by its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. 　Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century, at one stage being named Australia's most liveable city. 　As South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. 　Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.

Virtue (Latin: virtus) is moral excellence. 　A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. 　In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards: doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. 　The opposite of virtue is vice. 　Other examples of this notion include the concept of merit in Asian traditions as well as De (Chinese 德). 　Buddhism's four brahmavihara ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.

Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are vision eyewear with lenses (clear or tinted) mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms (known as temples or temple pieces) that rest over the ears. 　Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness; however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes. 　Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection on the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. 　Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. 　Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. 　Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. 　Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck to prevent the loss and breaking of the glasses. 　The loss of glasses would be detrimental to those working in these conditions. 　Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. 　Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; photochromic glasses are blacked out or lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when they come into contact with ultraviolet light. 　Most over-the-counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made. 　People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary symptom (like certain migraine disorders or Irlen syndrome) often wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even indoors and at night. 　Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example, 3D glasses for 3D films (stereoscopy). 　Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. 　Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials for frames.

This article contains Bengali text. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols. 　Bengal (/bɛnˈɡɔːl/ ben-GAWL; Bengali: বাংলা/বঙ্গ, romanized: Bānglā/Bôngô, pronounced [ˈbɔŋgo] (listen)) is a historical geographical, ethnolinguistic and cultural term referring to the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal. 　The region of Bengal proper is divided between modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. 　The Indian state of Tripura and the Barak Valley in the Indian state of Assam are also considered part of the Bengali cultural region. 　The administrative jurisdiction of Bengal historically extended beyond the territory of Bengal proper. 　Bengal ceased to be a single unit after the partition of India in 1947. 　Various Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric and other peoples inhabited the region since antiquity. 　The ancient Vanga Kingdom is widely regarded as the namesake of the Bengal region. 　The Bengali calendar dates back to the reign of Shashanka in the 4th century. 　The Pala Empire was founded in Bengal during the 8th century. 　The Sena dynasty ruled between the 11th and 13th centuries. 　By the 14th century, Bengal was absorbed by Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent. 　An independent Bengal Sultanate was formed and became the eastern frontier of the Islamic world. 　During this period, Bengal's rule and influence spread to Assam, Arakan, Tripura, Bihar, and Orissa. 　Mughal Bengal later emerged as a prosperous part of the Mughal Empire. 　The last independent Nawab of Bengal was defeated in 1757 at the Battle of Plassey by the British Empire's East India Company. 　The company's Bengal Presidency grew into the largest administrative unit of British India with Calcutta as the capital of India. 　At its peak, the presidency stretched from Burma, Penang, Singapore and Malacca in the east to The Punjab and Ceded and Conquered Provinces in the west. 　Bengal was gradually re-organized by the early 20th century. 　As a result of first partition of Bengal, a short-lived province called Eastern Bengal and Assam existed between 1905 and 1911 with its capital in the former Mughal capital Dhaka. 　Following the Sylhet referendum and votes by the Bengal Legislative Council and Bengal Legislative Assembly, the region was again divided along religious lines in 1947.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar>Calendar</a> 
<font size=3>
A calendar is a system of organizing days. 　This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. 　A date is the designation of a single and specific day within such a system. 　A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. 　A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. 　Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon. 　The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar, a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain synchronized with the solar year over the long term.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland>Mainland</a> 
<font size=3>
Mainland is defined as "relating to or forming the main part of a country or continent, not including the islands around it [regardless of status under territorial jurisdiction by an entity]." 　The term is often politically, economically and/or demographically more significant than politically associated remote territories, such as exclaves or oceanic islands situated outside the continental shelf. 　In geography, "mainland" can denote the continental (i.e. non-insular) part of any polity or the main island within an island nation. 　In geopolitics, "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like metropole as an antonym to overseas territories. 　In the sense of "heartland", mainland is the opposite of periphery. 　In some language a separate concept of "mainland" is missing and is replaced with a "continental portion". 　The term is relative: in Tasmania, continental Australia is the mainland, while to residents of Flinders Island, the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland", although the geological Australian continent includes all the former plus the island of New Guinea and all the smaller islands (e.g. the Torres Strait Islands) in between.

<font size=3>
The gmina (Polish: [ˈɡmʲina], plural gminy [ˈɡmʲinɨ]) is the principal unit of the administrative division of Poland, similar to a municipality. 　As of 1 January 2019[update], there were 2,477 gminas throughout the country, encompassing over 43,000 villages. 　940 gminas include cities and towns, with 302 among them constituting an independent urban gmina (Polish: gmina miejska) consisting solely of a standalone town or one of the 107 cities, the latter governed by a city mayor (prezydent miasta). 　The gmina has been the basic unit of territorial division in Poland since 1974, when it replaced the smaller gromada (cluster). 　Three or more gminas make up a higher level unit called powiat, except for those holding the status of a city with powiat rights. 　Each and every powiat has the seat in a city or town, in the latter case either an urban gmina or a part of an urban-rural one.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket>Rocket</a> 
<font size=3>
A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. 'bobbin/spool') is a vehicle that uses jet propulsion to accelerate without using the surrounding air. 　A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust expelled at high speed. 　Rocket engines work entirely from propellant carried within the vehicle; therefore a rocket can fly in the vacuum of space. 　Rockets work more efficiently in a vacuum and incur a loss of thrust due to the opposing pressure of the atmosphere. 　Multistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. 　Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. 　To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, or gravity. 　Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China. 　Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. 　Rockets are now used for fireworks, missiles and other weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration. 　Chemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. 　The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellant), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react (like kerosene (RP1) and liquid oxygen, used in most liquid-propellant rockets), a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). 　Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. 　However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope>Slope</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line. 　Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as "y = mx + b" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as "y = mx + c". 　Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line. 　Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient ("rise over run"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. 　A line that is decreasing has a negative "rise". 　The line may be practical – as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan. 　The steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. 　A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. 　The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. 　A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. 　The slope is positive, i.e. m > 0 {\displaystyle m>0} . 　A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. 　The slope is negative, i.e. m < 0 {\displaystyle m<0} . 　If a line is horizontal the slope is zero. 　This is a constant function. 　If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below). 　The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 − y1) = Δy. 　For relatively short distances, where the Earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 − x1) = Δx. 　Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line. 　In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is m = y 2 − y 1 x 2 − x 1 . 　{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.　} The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering. 　Through trigonometry, the slope m of a line is related to its angle of inclination θ by the tangent function m = tan ⁡ ( θ ) {\displaystyle m=\tan(\theta )} Thus, a 45° rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45° falling line has a slope of −1. 　As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point. 　When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. 　When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic expression, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve. 　This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors. 　Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment.
