<font size=3>
A regiment is a military unit. 　Its role and size varies markedly, depending on the country, service and/or a specialisation. 　In Medieval Europe, the term "regiment" denoted any large body of front-line soldiers, recruited or conscripted in one geographical area, by a leader who was often also the feudal lord in capite of the soldiers. 　Lesser barons of knightly rank could be expected to muster or hire a company or battalion from their manorial estate. 　By the end of the 17th century, infantry regiments in most European armies were permanent units, with approximately 800 men and commanded by a colonel.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation>Generation</a> 
<font size=3>
A generation refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively. 　It can also be described as, "the average period, generally considered to be about 20–⁠30 years, during which children are born and grow up, become adults, and begin to have children." 　In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. 　It is known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in the biological sciences. 　Generation is also often used synonymously with birth/age cohort in demographics, marketing, and social science; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time." 　Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. 　Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. 　Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter>Winter</a> 
<font size=3>
Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. 　It occurs after autumn and before spring. 　The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. 　Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. 　When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. 　In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. 　The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. 　The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 　The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. 　They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).

<font size=3>
In simple terms, risk is the possibility of something bad happening. 　Risk involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences. 　Many different definitions have been proposed. 　The international standard definition of risk for common understanding in different applications is “effect of uncertainty on objectives”. 　The understanding of risk, the methods of assessment and management, the descriptions of risk and even the definitions of risk differ in different practice areas (business, economics, environment, finance, information technology, health, insurance, safety, security etc). 　This article provides links to more detailed articles on these areas. 　The international standard for risk management, ISO 31000, provides principles and generic guidelines on managing risks faced by organizations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_(mythology)>Actor (mythology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Actor (Ancient Greek: Ἄκτωρ; gen.: Ἄκτoρος Aktoros) is a very common name in Greek mythology. 　Here is a selection of characters that share this name (which means 'leader', from the verb άγω: to lead or carry): Actor, father of Eurytus who was an ally of Phineus during his fight with Perseus. 　Actor, a king of Phthia, was said to be the son of King Myrmidon and Peisidice, daughter of Aeolus. 　Some say that Actor died childless, but others say that he is the father of Eurytion, his successor or of Irus, who was also called the father of Eurytion. 　According to Diodorus, Actor without an heir, was succeeded by Peleus who fled to his country from Aegina for killing his half-brother, Phocus. 　The hero was then purified by the king for his sins. 　This story was usually attributed to Actor's possible son Eurytion who was slain accidentally by his son-in-law Peleus. 　This Actor married Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus, and had several children, among them Menoetius. 　Menoetius was counted among the Argonauts, and was the father of Patroclus (Achilles' very close companion). 　Actor, son of King Deioneus of Phocis and Diomede, daughter of Xuthus, thus a brother of Asterodeia, Aenetus, Phylacus, and Cephalus. 　This Actor could be the man referred by Hesiod as the father of Protesilaus, one of the suitors of Helen of Troy. 　Actor, son of Azeus, descendant of Phrixus, was ruler of the Minyans of Orchomenus. 　He was father of Astyoche, who was seduced by the war-god Ares and bore him twin sons, named Ascalaphus and Ialmenus. 　These last two led the Minyan contingent to the Trojan War. 　Actor, son of Phorbas and Hyrmine, thus a brother of Augeas and Tiphys. 　He was king of Elis, and founded the city of Hyrmina, which he named after his mother. 　This Actor married Molione and became by her father of the twins known as the Molionides, Eurytus and Cteatus. 　Actor, the Epean son of Poseidon and Agamede, daughter of King Augeas. 　He was the brother of Belus and Dictys. 　Actor and Eurythemis were in one source called parents of Ancaeus (who other sources call the son of Lycurgus) and grandparents of Agapenor. 　Actor, the Achaean son of Hippasus from Pellene and one of the Argonauts. 　Actor, a Lapith. 　He was killed by the centaur Clanis. 　Actor, father of Sthenelus. 　Sthenelus followed Heracles in his campaign against the Amazons and was killed by them. 　Actor, son of Acastus, was accidentally killed by Peleus while hunting. 　As a retribution, Peleus sent to Acastus some cows and sheep that had been killed by a wolf sent by Thetis. 　Actor, son of Oenops, brother of Hyperbius. 　He was among the defenders of the Borraean Gate at Thebes when the Seven against Thebes attacked the city, and confronted Parthenopaeus at the gate. 　Actor, a warrior in the army of the Seven against Thebes. 　He saw a chasm open in the earth that swallowed Amphiaraus. 　Actor, an old Theban servant of Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus. 　During the war of the Seven against Thebes, he accompanied her to the walls when that army appeared in front of the barriers outside the city. 　Because of his age, Actor cannot follow the princess and he just stayed halfway up the climb to listen to her lament when she saw her brother in the enemy army. 　Actor, father of Echecles. 　His son married Polymele, mother of Eudoros by Hermes. 　Actor, a shepherd in Lemnos who befriended Philoctetes in Euripides' play Philoctetes. 　According to some accounts, he was instead the king of Lemnos whose shepherd named Iphimachus, son of Dolops, took care the abandoned hero after he was bitten by a snake. 　Actor, one of the companions of the exiled Aeneas. 　He is probably the same who in another passage is called an Auruncan, and of whose conquered lance Turnus made a boast. 　This story seems to have given rise to the proverbial saying "Actoris spolium" ("the spoil of Actor"), for any poor spoil in general. 　Actor, father of Actoris (though unnamed in the Odyssey) who was given by Icarius to his daughter Penelope after her wedding with Odysseus to serve as her personal handmaiden.

<font size=3>
An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a performance. 　The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. 　The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who answers". 　The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. 　This can also be considered an "actor's role," which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. 　Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art. 　Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. 　While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. 　The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe). 　After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England. 　In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball>Baseball</a> 
<font size=3>
Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. 　The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. 　The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 　The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. 　A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). 　The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. 　Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. 　The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. 　The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base. 　The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. 　One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. 　A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. 　Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. 　Baseball has no game clock. 　Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. 　This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. 　Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of "America's Pastime"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. 　In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 　In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. 　The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. 　The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. 　The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. 　Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.

A horse, in geology, is any block of rock completely separated from the surrounding rock either by mineral veins or fault planes. 　In mining, a horse is a block of country rock entirely encased within a mineral lode. 　In structural geology the term was first used to describe the thrust-bounded imbricates found within a thrust duplex. 　In later literature it has become a general term for any block entirely bounded by faults, whether the overall deformation type is contractional, extensional or strike-slip in nature.

The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. 　It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. 　The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. 　Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. 　Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. 　These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. 　There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. 　Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. 　Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. 　Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. 　Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. 　They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. 　Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. 　There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. 　Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. 　Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. 　Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. 　Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing>Wing</a> 
<font size=3>
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid. 　Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils. 　A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. 　The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. 　A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift. 　Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils. 　Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics. 　Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>Flow (psychology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. 　In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time. 　Flow is the melting together of action and consciousness; the state of finding a balance between a skill and how challenging that task is. 　It requires a high level of concentration, however; it should be effortless. 　Flow is used as a coping skill for stress and anxiety when productively pursuing a form of leisure that matches one's skill set. 　Named by the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy), though the concept has been claimed to have existed for thousands of years under other names.　[need quotation to verify] The flow state shares many characteristics with hyperfocus. 　However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. 　Some examples include spending "too much" time playing video games or becoming pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. 　In some cases, hyperfocus can "capture" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few. 　Hyperfocus is often mentioned "in the context of autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – conditions that have consequences on attentional abilities."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron>Iron</a> 
<font size=3>
Iron (/ˈaɪən/ or /ˈaɪərn/) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. 　It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. 　It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, just ahead of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. 　It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state, with its ores also being found there. 　Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) or higher, about 500 °C (932 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper. 　Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys—in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. 　That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. 　In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. 　The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound. 　Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. 　Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. 　Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. 　High-purity irons (e.g. electrolytic iron) are more resistant to corrosion. 　The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. 　These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. 　To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. 　Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. 　Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). 　Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. 　Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +7. 　Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.

<font size=3>
A tower is a tall structure, taller than it is wide, often by a significant factor. 　Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures. 　Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are built not to be habitable but to serve other functions using the height of the tower. 　For example, the height of a clock tower improves the visibility of the clock, and the height of a tower in a fortified building such as a castle increases the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes. 　Towers may also be built for observation, leisure, or telecommunication purposes. 　A tower can stand alone or be supported by adjacent buildings, or it may be a feature on top of a larger structure or building.

Please is a word used in the English language to indicate politeness and respect while making a request. 　Derived from shortening the phrase "if you please" or "if it please(s) you", the term has taken on substantial nuance based on its intonation and the relationship between the persons between whom it is used. 　In much of the Western world, use of the word is considered proper etiquette, and parents and authority figures often imprint upon children the importance of saying "please" when asking for something from an early age, leading to the description of the term as "the magic word".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom>Freedom</a> 
<font size=3>
Freedom is understood as either having the ability to act or change without constraint or to possess the power and resources to fulfill one's purposes unhindered. 　Freedom is often associated with liberty and autonomy in the sense of "giving oneself their own laws", and with having rights and the civil liberties with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. 　Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of choice, and freedom of speech. 　In one definition, something is "free" if it can change easily and is not constrained in its present state. 　In philosophy and religion, freedom is sometimes associated with free will, without undue or unjust constraints on that will, such as enslavement. 　It is an idea closely tied with the concept of negative liberty. 　Charles Taylor resolves one of the issues that separate "positive" and "negative" theories of freedom, as these were initially distinguished in Isaiah Berlin's seminal essay, "Two concepts of liberty". 　Taylor sees it as undeniable that there are two such families of conceptions of political freedom. 　Negative liberty is a concept that is often used in political philosophy. 　It is the idea that freedom means an ability to do what one wants, without external obstacles. 　This concept has been called too simplistic for discounting the importance of individual self-realization. 　Positive liberty is the ability to fulfill one's purposes.

<font size=3>
A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with several uses. 　It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. 　Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling. 　Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. 　Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. 　Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. 　The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame. 　Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials. 　As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word "ball" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects. 　"Ball" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, making a fist into a ball.

Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. 　Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama. 　Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. 　Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. 　The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. 　Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera. 　Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: ὑπόκρισις, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach>Beach</a> 
<font size=3>
A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. 　The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. 　Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material. 　Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. 　Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. 　Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. 　However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. 　Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise. 　Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines. 　These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. 　To support these uses, some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. 　They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents. 　Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change. 　Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment. 　Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. 　Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. 　Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure.
