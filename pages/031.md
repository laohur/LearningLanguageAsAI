<font size=3>
Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: To~uwaisu; commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. 　The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. 　Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins. 　Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. 　Their next single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. 　The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. 　Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album. 　As of December 2020, the group has sold over 15 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan. 　The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. 　The album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. 　It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. 　Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single in the same year. 　Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour. 　Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single "Likey" in 2017. 　With the release of their single "Feel Special" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the Canadian Hot 100. 　After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group has charted into the US Billboard 200 with More & More and Eyes Wide Open in 2020, Taste of Love and Formula of Love: O+T=<3 in 2021, and Between 1&2 in 2022. 　Their first official English-language single, "The Feels", became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. 　They have been dubbed the next "Nation's Girl Group", and their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "Signal" (2017), and "What Is Love?" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.

A kiss is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. 　Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. 　Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of love, passion, romance, sexual attraction, sexual activity, sexual arousal, affection, respect, greeting, peace, and good luck, among many others. 　In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or a sacramental. 　The word came from Old English cyssan ("to kiss"), in turn from coss ("a kiss").

<font size=3>
Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. 　Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. 　Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. 　This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview>Interview</a> 
<font size=3>
An interview is a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers. 　In common parlance, the word "interview" refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee. 　The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually providing information. 　That information may be used or provided to other audiences immediately or later. 　This feature is common to many types of interviews – a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time, but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process. 　An interview may also transfer information in both directions. 　Interviews usually take place face-to-face, in person, but the parties may instead be separated geographically, as in videoconferencing or telephone interviews. 　Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties. 　In some instances a "conversation" can happen between two persons who type their questions and answers. 　Interviews can be unstructured, free-wheeling and open-ended conversations without predetermined plan or prearranged questions. 　One form of unstructured interview is a focused interview in which the interviewer consciously and consistently guides the conversation so that the interviewee's responses do not stray from the main research topic or idea. 　Interviews can also be highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order. 　They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a ladder interview, a respondent's answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent's subconscious motives. 　Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by keeping notes with a pencil and paper, or with a video or audio recorder. 　Interviews usually have a limited duration, with a beginning and an ending. 　The traditionally two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and follow-ups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy and relevance of responses. 　It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. 　Further, it eliminates possible distortion due to other parties being present. 　Face to face interviewing helps both parties to interact and form a connection, and understand the other. 　Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.

<font size=3>
In biological taxonomy, a domain (/dəˈmeɪn/ or /doʊˈmeɪn/) (Latin: regio), also dominion, superkingdom, realm, or empire, is the highest taxonomic rank of all organisms taken together. 　It was introduced in the three-domain system of taxonomy devised by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990. 　According to the domain system, the tree of life consists of either three domains such as Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, or two domains consisting of Archaea and Bacteria, with Eukarya included in Archaea. 　The first two are all prokaryotes, single-celled microorganisms without a membrane-bound nucleus. 　All organisms that have a cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles are included in Eukarya. 　Non-cellular life is not included in this system. 　Alternatives to the three-domain system include the earlier two-empire system (with the empires Prokaryota and Eukaryota), and the eocyte hypothesis (with two domains of Bacteria and Archaea, with Eukarya included as a branch of Archaea).

A label (as distinct from signage) is a piece of paper, plastic film, cloth, metal, or other material affixed to a container or product, on which is written or printed information or symbols about the product or item. 　Information printed directly on a container or article can also be considered labelling. 　Labels have many uses, including promotion and providing information on a product's origin, the manufacturer (e.g., brand name), use, safety, shelf-life and disposal, some or all of which may be governed by legislation such as that for food in the UK or United States. 　Methods of production and attachment to packaging are many and various and may also be subject to internationally recognised standards. 　In many countries, hazardous products such as poisons or flammable liquids must have a warning label.

<font size=3>
A label is an abstract concept in sociology used to group people together based on perceived or held identity. 　Labels are a mode of identifying social groups. 　Labels can create a sense of community within groups, but they can also cause harm when used to separate individuals and groups from mainstream society. 　Individuals may choose a label, or they may be assigned one by others. 　The act of labeling may affect an individual's behavior and their reactions to the social world. 　Symbolic interactionism and labeling theory both examine labels as a social concept, and emphasize the social weight of labels and labeling. 　Symbolic interactionism focuses on expectations of social roles, while labeling theory focuses on the social and individual consequences of labeling. 　Both theories link between labels and contexts and maintain that their meanings are socially defined rather than universal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency>Frequency</a> 
<font size=3>
Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. 　It is also occasionally referred to as temporal frequency for clarity, and is distinct from angular frequency. 　Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) which is equal to one event per second. 　The period is the interval of time between events, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. 　For example, if a heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute (2 hertz), the period, T—the interval at which the beats repeat—is half a second (60 seconds divided by 120 beats). 　Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals (sound), radio waves, and light.

<font size=3>
A farm (also called an agricultural holding) is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. 　The name is used for specialized units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fiber, biofuel and other commodities. 　It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. 　In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. 　There are about 570 million farms in the world, most of which are small and family-operated. 　Small farms with a land area of fewer than 2 hectares operate about 1% of the world's agricultural land, and family farms comprise about 75% of the world's agricultural land. 　Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. 　In the United States, livestock may be raised on range, land and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. 　In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. 　In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. 　In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market. 　Acres can hold the crops.

An address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers and organization name. 　Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a postal code, to make identification easier and aid in the routing of mail. 　Addresses provide a means of physically locating a building. 　They are used in identifying buildings as the end points of a postal system and as parameters in statistics collection, especially in census-taking and the insurance industry. 　Address formats are different in different places, and unlike latitude and longitude coordinates, there is no simple mapping from an address to a location.

Communication is usually defined as the transmission of information. 　The term can also refer to the message itself or the field of inquiry studying these transmissions, also known as communication studies. 　There are some disagreements about the precise definition of communication, for example, whether unintentional or failed transmissions are also included and whether communication does not just transmit meaning but also create it. 　Models of communication aim to provide a simplified overview of its main components and their interaction. 　Many models include the idea that a source uses a coding system to express information in the form of a message. 　The source uses a channel to send the message to a receiver who has to decode it in order to understand its meaning. 　Channels are usually discussed in terms of the senses used to perceive the message, like hearing, sight, smell, touch, and taste. 　Communication can be classified based on whether information is exchanged between humans, members of other species, or non-living entities such as computers. 　For human communication, an important distinction is between verbal and non-verbal communication. 　Verbal communication involves the exchange of messages in linguistic form. 　This can happen through natural languages, like English or Japanese, or through artificial languages, like Esperanto. 　Verbal communication includes spoken and written messages as well as the use of sign language. 　Non-verbal communication happens without the use of a linguistic system. 　There are many forms of non-verbal communication, for example, using body language, body position, touch, and intonation. 　Another important distinction is between interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. 　Interpersonal communication happens between distinct individuals, such as greeting someone on the street or making a phone call. 　Intrapersonal communication, on the other hand, refers to communication with oneself. 　This can happen internally, as a form of inner dialog or daydreaming, or externally, for example, when writing down a shopping list or engaging in a monologue. 　Non-human forms of communication include animal and plant communication. 　Researchers in this field often formulate additional criteria for their definition of communicative behavior, like the requirement that the behavior serves a beneficial function for natural selection or that a response to the message is observed. 　Animal communication plays important roles for various species in the areas of courtship and mating, parent-offspring relations, social relations, navigation, self-defense, and territoriality. 　In the area of courtship and mating, for example, communication is used to identify and attract potential mates. 　An often-discussed example concerning navigational communication is the waggle dance used by bees to indicate to other bees where flowers are located. 　Due to the rigid cell walls of plants, their communication often happens through chemical means rather than movement. 　For example, various plants, like maple trees, release so-called volatile organic compounds into the air to warn other plants of a herbivore attack. 　Most communication takes place between members of the same species since its purpose is usually some form of cooperation, which is not as common between species. 　However, there are also forms of interspecies communication, mainly in cases of symbiotic relationships. 　For example, many flowers use symmetrical shapes and colors that stand out from their surroundings in order to communicate to insects where nectar is located to attract them. 　Humans also practice interspecies communication, for example, when interacting with pets. 　The field of communication includes various other issues, like communicative competence and the history of communication. 　Communicative competence refers to the ability to communicate well and applies both to the capability to formulate messages and to understand them. 　Two central aspects are that the communicative behavior is effective, i.e. that it achieves the individual's goal, and that it is appropriate, i.e. that it follows social standards and expectations. 　Human communication has a long history and how people exchange information has changed over time. 　These changes were usually triggered by the development of new communication technologies, such as the invention of writing systems (first pictographic and later alphabetic), the development of mass printing, the use of radio and television, and the invention of the internet.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price>Price</a> 
<font size=3>
A price is the (usually not negative) quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for goods or services. 　In some situations, the price of production has a different name. 　If the product is a "good" in the commercial exchange, the payment for this product will likely be called its "price". 　However, if the product is "service", there will be other possible names for this product's name. 　For example, the graph on the bottom will show some situations A good's price is influenced by production costs, supply of the desired item, and demand for the product. 　A price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions. 　Price can be quoted to currency, quantities of goods or vouchers. 　In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. 　(More specifically, for raw materials they are expressed as currency per unit weight, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.) 　Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. 　Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. 　In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War II. 　In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common. 　In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways. 　The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. 　The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. 　Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. 　For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued. 　"Price" sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. 　This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called transaction price or traded price. 　Likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets. 　Economic price theory asserts that in a free market economy the market price reflects interaction between supply and demand: the price is set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded. 　In turn, these quantities are determined by the marginal utility of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers. 　Supply and demand, and hence price, may be influenced by other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion. 　When a raw material or a similar economic good for sale at multiple locations, the law of one price is generally believed to hold. 　This essentially states that the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax>Tax</a> 
<font size=3>
A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national), and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs. 　The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC. 　A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. 　Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent. 　Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. 　Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. 　Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. 　Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs. 　In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. 　This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). 　Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner, others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von>Von</a> 
<font size=3>
The term von ([fɔn]) is used in German language surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means of or from. 　Nobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant "Hans from [the city of] Duisburg". 　This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility.

<font size=3>
Leadership, both as a research area and as a practical skill, encompasses the ability of an individual, group or organization to "lead", influence or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. 　The word "leadership" often gets viewed as a contested term. 　Specialist literature debates various viewpoints on the concept, sometimes contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) North American versus European approaches. 　U.S. academic environments define leadership as "a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common and ethical task". 　Basically, leadership can be defined as an influential power-relationship in which the power of one party (the "leader") promotes movement/change in others (the "followers"). 　Some have challenged the more traditional managerial views of leadership (which portray leadership as something possessed or owned by one individual due to their role or authority), and instead advocate the complex nature of leadership which is found at all levels of institutions, both within formal and informal roles.　[need quotation to verify] Studies of leadership have produced theories involving (for example) traits, situational interaction, function, behavior, power, vision and values,[need quotation to verify] charisma, and intelligence, among others.

<font size=3>
In ancient Roman religion Victoria was the deified personification of victory. 　She first appears during the first Punic War, seemingly as a Romanised re-naming of Nike, the goddess of victory associated with Rome's Greek allies in the Greek mainland and in Magna Graecia. 　Thereafter she comes to symbolise Rome's eventual hegemony and right to rule. 　She is a deified abstraction, entitled to cult but unlike Nike, she has virtually no mythology of her own.

<font size=3>
In prehistoric archaeology, an avenue is a long, parallel-sided strip of land, measuring up to about 30m in width, open at either end, with edges marked by stone or timber alignments and/or a low earth bank and ditch. 　The term is used for such features all over the British Isles but they are concentrated in the centre and south of England. 　Most are either short and straight (Type I, less than 800m long), or long and curving (Type II, up to 2.5 km). 　It has been noted that they often link stone circles with rivers. 　They are a common element to Bronze Age ritual landscapes. 　Avenues are identified through their earthworks or using aerial archaeology, as their parallel features can be seen stretching over some distance. 　In most examples, it is the association of the avenue with other contemporary monuments that provides diagnosis. 　Avenues differ from cursus monuments, in that the latter also have earthworks at their terminal ends and have no upright stone or timber alignments. 　Avenues are thought to have been ceremonial or processional paths and to be of early Bronze Age date. 　They seem to have been used to indicate the intended route of approach to a particular monument. 　Examples in Britain include the Stonehenge Avenue, and Beckhampton Avenue and West Kennet Avenue at Avebury. 　An example in Ireland is the avenue going up the Hill of Tara.
