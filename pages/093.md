<font size=3>
A missionary is a member of a religious group which is sent into an area in order to promote its faith or provide services to people, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development. 　In the Latin translation of the Bible, Jesus Christ says the word when he sends the disciples into areas and commands them to preach the gospel in his name. 　The term is most commonly used in reference to Christian missions, but it can also be used in reference to any creed or ideology. 　The word mission originated in 1598 when Jesuits, the members of the Society of Jesus sent members abroad, derived from the Latin missionem (nom. missio), meaning 'act of sending' or mittere, meaning 'to send'.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption>Adoption</a> 
<font size=3>
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. 　Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents. 　Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. 　Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation). 　Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_(theology)>Adoption (theology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Adoption, in Christian theology, is the reception of a believer into the family of God. 　In the Reformed ordo salutis ("order of salvation"), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification. 　As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of parents who legally take responsibility for a child who was not originally born to them. 　There are three references in the New Testament to God "adopting" ('υιοθεσια) Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to God adopting "people of Israel" (Romans 9:4). 　Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of salvation. 　Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the 'legal' act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation. 　The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13). 　Adoption is an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith: All those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God.

<font size=3>
Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or other parts of the body to ascend a steep topographical object that can range from the world's tallest mountains (e.g. the eight thousanders) to small boulders. 　Climbing is done for locomotion, for sporting recreation, for competition, and is also done in trades that rely on ascension; such as rescue and military operations. 　Climbing is done indoors and outdoors, on natural surfaces (e.g. rock climbing and ice climbing), and on artificial surfaces (e.g. climbing walls). 　Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides (e.g. the UIAGM), were a significant element in developing the popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and remain so today. 　Since the 1980s, the development of competition climbing and the availability of artificial climbing walls have dramatically increased the popularity of rock climbing as a sport, and led to the emergence of professional rock climbers, such as Wolfgang Güllich, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, Lynn Hill, Catherine Destivelle, and Janja Garnbret. 　Climbing became an Olympic sport for the first time in the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo (see Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics) for sport climbing and speed climbing disciplines.

<font size=3>
A tributary, or affluent, is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. 　A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. 　Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. 　The Irtysh is a chief tributary of the Ob river and is also the longest tributary river in the world with a length of 4,248 km (2,640 mi). 　The Madeira River is the largest tributary river by volume in the world with an average discharge of 31,200 m3/s (1.1 million cu ft/s). 　A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet, usually refers to the joining of tributaries. 　The opposite to a tributary is a distributary, a river or stream that branches off from and flows away from the main stream. 　Distributaries are most often found in river deltas.

An elevator or lift is a machine that vertically transports people or freight between levels. 　They are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack. 　In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. 　Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators. 　Languages other than English, such as Japanese, may refer to elevators by loanwords based on either elevator or lift. 　Due to wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps are not possible. 　High-speed elevators are elevators that move faster than regular elevators and are common in skyscrapers and towers. 　Some elevators can also travel horizontally in addition to the usual vertical motion.

<font size=3>
Moses (/ˈmoʊzɪz, -zɪs/) is considered the most important prophet in Judaism and one of the most important prophets in Christianity, Islam, the Druze faith, the Baháʼí Faith and other Abrahamic religions. 　According to both the Bible and the Quran, Moses was the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver to whom the authorship, or "acquisition from heaven", of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible) is attributed. 　According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in population and, as a result, the Egyptian Pharaoh worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. 　Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. 　Through Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. 　After killing an Egyptian slave-master who was beating a Hebrew, Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered the Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb, which he regarded as the Mountain of God. 　God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. 　Moses said that he could not speak eloquently, so God allowed Aaron, his elder brother, to become his spokesperson. 　After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. 　After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died on Mount Nebo at the age of 120, within sight of the Promised Land. 　Generally, scholars see Moses as a legendary figure, whilst retaining the possibility that Moses or a Moses-like figure existed in the 13th century BCE. 　Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE; Jerome suggested 1592 BCE, and James Ussher suggested 1571 BCE as his birth year.

<font size=3>
Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". 　Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). 　Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. 　Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. 　A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, contradistinguishing abduction from induction. 　Various fields study how inference is done in practice. 　Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. 　Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. 　This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. 　Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. 　Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 　A male that has been castrated is a capon. 　An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. 　Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. 　Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. 　The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers. 　Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update], up from more than 19 billion in 2011. 　There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. 　There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.　[citation needed] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. 　From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. 　They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. 　They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture>Lecture</a> 
<font size=3>
A lecture (from Latin lēctūra “reading” ) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. 　Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. 　A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. 　Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content. 　Though lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses. 　Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning. 　Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. 　Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study. 　Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. 　Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "keynote addresses", i.e., lectures. 　The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. 　Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. 　Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. 　Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. 　Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome>Syndrome</a> 
<font size=3>
A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms which are correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder. 　The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον, meaning "concurrence".　: 1818  When a syndrome is paired with a definite cause this becomes a disease. 　In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them. 　This substitution of terminology often confuses the reality and meaning of medical diagnoses. 　This is especially true of inherited syndromes. 　About one third of all phenotypes that are listed in OMIM are described as dysmorphic, which usually refers to the facial gestalt. 　For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature. 　In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. 　For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms. 　If an underlying genetic cause is suspected but not known, a condition may be referred to as a genetic association (often just "association" in context). 　By definition, an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.　: 167  Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture. 　Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms. 　Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively (by symptoms or underlying cause) rather than eponymously, but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage. 　The defining of syndromes has sometimes been termed syndromology, but it is usually not a separate discipline from nosology and differential diagnosis generally, which inherently involve pattern recognition (both sentient and automated) and differentiation among overlapping sets of signs and symptoms. 　Teratology (dysmorphology) by its nature involves the defining of congenital syndromes that may include birth defects (pathoanatomy), dysmetabolism (pathophysiology), and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi>Rabbi</a> 
<font size=3>
A rabbi (/ˈræbaɪ/) is a spiritual leader or religious teacher in Judaism. 　One becomes a rabbi by being ordained by another rabbi – known as semikha – following a course of study of Jewish history and texts such as the Talmud. 　The basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic (167 BCE–73 CE) and Talmudic (70–640 CE) eras, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. 　The title "rabbi" was first used in the first century CE. 　In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister, hence the title "pulpit rabbis", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. 　Within the various Jewish denominations, there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is recognized as a rabbi. 　For example, only a minority of Orthodox Jewish communities accept the ordination of women rabbis. 　Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons (Conservative Judaism) as well as ethical reasons (Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism).
