<font size=3>
In algebraic topology, a k-chain is a formal linear combination of the k-cells in a cell complex. 　In simplicial complexes (respectively, cubical complexes), k-chains are combinations of k-simplices (respectively, k-cubes), but not necessarily connected. 　Chains are used in homology; the elements of a homology group are equivalence classes of chains.

<font size=3>
A chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. 　A chain may consist of two or more links. 　Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). 　Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types. 　Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. 　They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chains. 　Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis. 　Load can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper.

<font size=3>
The Internet (or internet) is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. 　It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 　The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. 　The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. 　The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s to enable resource sharing. 　The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. 　The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. 　Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life. 　Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. 　Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology or being reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. 　The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. 　Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. 　Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. 　The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. 　The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 　The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. 　In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven Wonders.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate>Climate</a> 
<font size=3>
Climate is the long-term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years. 　More rigorously, it is the mean and variability of meteorological variables over a time spanning from months to millions of years. 　Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. 　In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere and the interactions between them. 　The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, longitude, terrain, altitude, land use and nearby water bodies and their currents. 　Climates can be classified according to the average and typical variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. 　The most widely used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. 　The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. 　Finally, the Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 　Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. 　Paleoclimatologists seek to explain climate variations for all parts of the Earth during any given geologic period, beginning with the time of the Earth's formation. 　Since very few direct observations of climate were available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables. 　They include non-biotic evidence—such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores—and biotic evidence—such as tree rings and coral. 　Climate models are mathematical models of past, present, and future climates. 　Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from various factors. 　Recent warming is discussed in global warming, which results in redistributions. 　For example, "a 3 °C [5 °F] change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km [190–250 mi] in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m [1,600 ft] in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones."

Ohio (/oʊˈhaɪoʊ/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　Of the fifty U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.8 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. 　The state's capital and largest city is Columbus, with the Columbus metro area, Greater Cincinnati, and Greater Cleveland being the largest metropolitan areas. 　Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. 　Ohio is historically known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes". 　Its state flag is the only non-rectangular flag of all the U.S. states. 　Ohio takes its name from the Ohio River, which in turn originated from the Seneca word ohiːyo', meaning "good river", "great river", or "large creek". 　The state arose from the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains that were contested from colonial times through the Northwest Indian Wars of the late 18th century. 　It was partitioned from the resulting Northwest Territory, which was the first frontier of the new United States, becoming the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance. 　Ohio was the first post-colonial free state admitted to the union and became one of the earliest and most influential industrial powerhouses during the 20th century. 　Although it has transitioned to a more information- and service-based economy in the 21st century, it remains an industrial state, ranking seventh in GDP as of 2019[update], with the third-largest manufacturing sector and second-largest automobile production. 　The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. 　Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives. 　The state is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections. 　Seven presidents of the United States have come from Ohio. 　This has led to it receiving the moniker "the Mother of Presidents".

<font size=3>
The matrix or groundmass of a rock is the finer-grained mass of material in which larger grains, crystals, or clasts are embedded. 　The matrix of an igneous rock consists of finer-grained, often microscopic, crystals in which larger crystals, called phenocrysts, are embedded. 　This porphyritic texture is indicative of multi-stage cooling of magma. 　For example, porphyritic andesite will have large phenocrysts of plagioclase in a fine-grained matrix. 　Also in South Africa, diamonds are often mined from a matrix of weathered clay-like rock (kimberlite) called "yellow ground". 　The matrix of sedimentary rocks is finer-grained sedimentary material, such as clay or silt, in which larger grains or clasts are embedded. 　It is also used to describe the rock material in which a fossil is embedded.

<font size=3>
Jesus (c. 4 BC – AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth (among other names and titles), was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader; he is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. 　Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. 　Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically. 　Research into the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus, as the only detailed records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels. 　Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was circumcised, was baptized by John the Baptist, began his own ministry, and was often referred to as "rabbi". 　Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers. 　He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Jerusalem. 　After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church. 　Accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels. 　Christian theology includes the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. 　Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. 　The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead, either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. 　The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity; there is a small minority of Christian denominations that reject trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. 　The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on 25 December as Christmas. 　His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. 　The world's most widely used calendar era—in which the current year is AD 2023 (or 2023 CE)—is based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus. 　Jesus is also revered in Baha'i faith, Druze faith, Islam and Manichaeism. 　In Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ʿĪsā) is considered the penultimate prophet of God and the messiah, who will return before the Day of Judgement. 　Muslims believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary but was neither God nor a son of God. 　Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. 　In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.

<font size=3>
Magic or mana is an attribute assigned to characters within a role-playing or video game that indicates their power to use special magical abilities or "spells". 　Magic is usually measured in magic points or mana points, shortened as MP. 　Different abilities will use up different amounts of MP. 　When the MP of a character reaches zero, the character will not be able to use special abilities until some of their MP is recovered. 　Much like health, magic might be displayed as a numeric value, such as "50/100". 　Here, the first number indicates the current amount of MP a character has whereas the second number indicates the character's maximum MP. 　In video games, magic can also be displayed visually, such as with a gauge that empties itself as a character uses their abilities.　[self-published source?]

<font size=3>
In political science, a revolution (Latin: revolutio, 'a turn around') is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which occurs when the population revolts against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic) or political incompetence. 　Revolutions have occurred throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. 　Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions, usually in response to perceived overwhelming autocracy or plutocracy. 　Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. 　Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in European history from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including sociology and political science. 　Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon. 　Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the creation of the United States through the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826), the European Revolutions of 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Chinese Revolution of the 1940s, the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the European Revolutions of 1989.
