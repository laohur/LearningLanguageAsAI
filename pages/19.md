## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause>Clause</a> 

<font size=3>
In language, a clause is a constituent that comprises a semantic predicand (expressed or not) and a semantic predicate. 　A typical clause consists of a subject and a syntactic predicate, the latter typically a verb phrase composed of a verb with any objects and other modifiers. 　However, the subject is sometimes unvoiced if it is retrievable from context, especially in null-subject language but also in other languages, including English instances of the imperative mood. 　A complete simple sentence includes a single clause with a finite verb. 　Complex sentences contain multiple clauses including at least one independent clause (meaning, a clause that can stand alone as a simple sentence) coordinated either with at least one dependent clause (also called an embedded clause) or with one or more independent clauses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch>Ranch</a> 

<font size=3>
A ranch (from Spanish: rancho) is an area of land, including various structures, given primarily to ranching, the practice of raising grazing livestock such as cattle and sheep. 　It is a subtype of a farm. 　These terms are most often applied to livestock-raising operations in Mexico, the Western United States and Western Canada, though there are ranches in other areas. 　People who own or operate a ranch are called ranchers, cattlemen, or stockgrowers. 　Ranching is also a method used to raise less common livestock such as horses, elk, American bison, ostrich, emu, and alpaca. 　Ranches generally consist of large areas, but may be of nearly any size. 　In the western United States, many ranches are a combination of privately owned land supplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal Bureau of Land Management or the United States Forest Service. 　If the ranch includes arable or irrigated land, the ranch may also engage in a limited amount of farming, raising crops for feeding the animals, such as hay and feed grains. 　Ranches that cater exclusively to tourists are called guest ranches or, colloquially, "dude ranches". 　Most working ranches do not cater to guests, though they may allow private hunters or outfitters onto their property to hunt native wildlife. 　However, in recent years,[when?] a few struggling smaller operations have added some dude ranch features such as horseback rides, cattle drives, and guided hunting to bring in additional income. 　Ranching is part of the iconography of the "Wild West" as seen in Western movies and rodeos.

<font size=3>
Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. 　Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. 　Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. 　As of July 2022, Facebook claimed 2.93 billion monthly active users, and ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites as of July 2022. 　It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s. 　Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. 　After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. 　They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. 　Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow. 　The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance. 　Posts originating from the Facebook page of Breitbart News, a media organization previously affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, are currently among the most widely shared political content on Facebook. 　Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech. 　Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.

<font size=3>
An anchor is a device, normally made of metal[citation needed], used to secure a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current. 　The word derives from Latin ancoracode: lat promoted to code: la , which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυραcode: ell promoted to code: el (ankȳracode: ell promoted to code: el ). 　Anchors can either be temporary or permanent. 　Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them. 　Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights. 　A sea anchor is a drag device, not in contact with the seabed, used to minimise drift of a vessel relative to the water. 　A drogue is a drag device used to slow or help steer a vessel running before a storm in a following or overtaking sea, or when crossing a bar in a breaking sea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman>Gentleman</a> 

<font size=3>
A gentleman (Old French: gentilz hom, gentle + man) is any man of good and courteous conduct. 　Originally, gentleman was the lowest rank of the landed gentry of England, ranking below an esquire and above a yeoman; by definition, the rank of gentleman comprised the younger sons of the younger sons of peers, and the younger sons of a baronet, a knight, and an esquire, in perpetual succession. 　As such, the connotation of the term gentleman captures the common denominator of gentility (and often a coat of arms); a right shared by the peerage and the gentry, the constituent classes of the British nobility. 　Therefore, the English social category of gentleman corresponds to the French gentilhomme (nobleman), which in Great Britain meant a member of the peerage of England. 　In that context, the historian Maurice Keen said that the social category of gentleman is "the nearest, contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France." 　In the 14th century, the term gentlemen comprised the hereditary ruling class, which is whom the rebels of the Peasants' Revolt (1381) meant when they repeated: When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman? 　In the 17th century, in Titles of Honour (1614), the jurist John Selden said that the title gentleman likewise speaks of "our English use of it" as convertible with nobilis (nobility by rank or personal quality) and describes the forms of a man's elevation to the nobility in European monarchies. 　In the 19th century, James Henry Lawrence explained and discussed the concepts, particulars, and functions of social rank in a monarchy, in the book On the Nobility of the British Gentry, or the Political Ranks and Dignities of the British Empire, Compared with those on the Continent (1827).

Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. 　More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. 　The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries. 　Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. 　They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus. 　Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. 　Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. 　In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.

Azerbaijan (UK: /ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, -ˈdʒæn/ (listen), US: /ˌɑːzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, ˌæz-/; Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈdʒɑn]), officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a transcontinental country located at the boundary of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. 　It is a part of the South Caucasus region and is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia (Republic of Dagestan) to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the west, and Iran to the south. 　Baku is the capital and largest city. 　The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state. 　In 1920, the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan SSR. 　The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the same year. 　In September 1991, the ethnic Armenian majority of the Nagorno-Karabakh region formed the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh. 　The region and seven surrounding districts are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, pending a solution to the status of Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE, although became de facto independent with the end of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. 　Following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020, the seven districts and parts of Nagorno-Karabakh were returned to Azerbaijani control. 　Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic. 　It is one of six independent Turkic states and an active member of the Organization of Turkic States and the TÜRKSOY community. 　Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 182 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OSCE, and the NATO PfP program. 　It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the CIS, and the OPCW. 　Azerbaijan is also an observer state of the WTO. 　The vast majority of the country's population (97%) is nominally Muslim, but the constitution does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. 　Azerbaijan is a developing country and ranks 91st on the Human Development Index. 　It has a high rate of economic development, literacy, and a low rate of unemployment. 　However, the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, in power since 1993, has been accused of authoritarian leadership under the leadership of both Heydar Aliyev and his son Ilham Aliyev, and deteriorating the country's human rights record, including increasing restrictions on civil liberties, particularly on press freedom and political repression.

<font size=3>
GK CB CB RB LB RWB LWB CDM CDM RM LM CM CM RAM LAM CAM CAM RW LW CF CF ST ST A midfielder is an outfield position in association football. 　Midfielders may play an exclusively right back role, breaking up attacks, and are in that case known as defensive midfielders. 　As central midfielders often go across boundaries, with mobility and passing ability, they are often referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box midfielders, or holding midfielders. 　There are also attacking midfielders with limited defensive assignments. 　The size of midfield units on a team and their assigned roles depend on what formation is used; the unit of these players on the pitch is commonly referred to as the midfield. 　Its name derives from the fact that midfield units typically make up the in-between units to the defensive units and forward units of a formation. 　Managers frequently assign one or more midfielders to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. 　Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. 　Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch. 　Midfielders are often assigned the task of assisting forwards to create scoring chances.

Coordinates: 39°00′N 75°30′W﻿ / ﻿39.0°N 75.5°W﻿ / 39.0; -75.5﻿ (State of Delaware) Delaware (/ˈdɛləwɛər/ (listen) DEL-ə-wair) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Maryland to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. 　The state takes its name from the adjacent Delaware Bay, in turn named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. 　Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. 　It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. 　Delaware's largest city is Wilmington, while the state capital is Dover, the second-largest city in the state. 　The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of counties of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. 　While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle is more urbanized, being part of the Delaware Valley Metropolitan Statistical Area centered on Philadelphia. 　Although included in the Southern United States by the Census Bureau, Delaware's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country. 　Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. 　It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631. 　Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that took part in the American Revolution. 　On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, and has since been known as The First State. 　Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware is also a de facto onshore corporate haven, in which by virtue of its corporate laws, the state is the domicile of over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed business and over three-fifths of the Fortune 500.

<font size=3>
Bulgaria (/bʌlˈɡɛəriə, bʊl-/ (listen); Bulgarian: България, romanized: Bǎlgariya), officially the Republic of Bulgaria, is a country in Southeast Europe. 　It is situated on the eastern flank of the Balkans, and is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. 　Bulgaria covers a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), and is the sixteenth-largest country in Europe. 　Sofia is the nation's capital and largest city; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. 　One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. 　In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts and Macedonians; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45. 　After the Roman state splintered, tribal invasions in the region resumed. 　Around the 6th century, these territories were settled by the early Slavs. 　The Bulgars, led by Asparuh, attacked from the lands of Old Great Bulgaria and permanently invaded the Balkans in the late 7th century. 　They established First Bulgarian Empire, victoriously recognised by treaty in 681 AD by the Eastern Roman Empire. 　It dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. 　The First Bulgarian Empire lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. 　A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II (1218–1241). 　After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated and in 1396 fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. 　The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. 　Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. 　In 1946, Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc and became a socialist state. 　The ruling Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multiparty elections. 　Bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy. 　Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. 　Bulgaria is a developing country, with an upper-middle-income economy, ranking 68th in the Human Development Index. 　Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and is largely based on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. 　Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018. 　The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population slowly shrinking, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988, to roughly 6.5 million today. 　Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is also a founding member of the OSCE, and has taken a seat on the United Nations Security Council three times.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_(hydrology)>Armor (hydrology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In hydrology and geography, armor is the association of surface pebbles, rocks or boulders with stream beds or beaches. 　Most commonly hydrological armor occurs naturally; however, a man-made form is usually called riprap, when shorelines or stream banks are fortified for erosion protection with large boulders or sizable manufactured concrete objects. 　When armor is associated with beaches in the form of pebbles to medium-sized stones grading from two to 200 millimeters across, the resulting landform is often termed a shingle beach. 　Hydrological modeling indicates that stream armor typically persists in a flood stage environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture>Torture</a> 

<font size=3>
Torture is the deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering on a person for reasons such as punishment, extracting a confession, interrogation for information, or intimidating third parties. 　Some definitions are restricted to acts carried out by the state, but others include non-state organizations. 　Torture has been carried out since ancient times. 　In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Western countries abolished the official use of torture in the judicial system, but torture continued to be used throughout the world. 　A variety of methods of torture are used, often in combination; the most common form of physical torture is beatings. 　Since the twentieth century, many torturers have preferred non-scarring or psychological methods to provide deniability. 　Torturers are enabled by organizations that facilitate and encourage their behavior. 　Most victims of torture are poor and marginalized people suspected of crimes, although torture against political prisoners or during armed conflict has received disproportionate attention. 　Judicial corporal punishment and capital punishment are sometimes seen as forms of torture, but this label is internationally controversial. 　Torture aims to break the victim's will and destroy their agency and personality. 　It is one of the most damaging experiences that a person can undergo and can also negatively affect perpetrating individuals and institutions. 　Public opinion research has shown general opposition to torture. 　Torture is prohibited under international law for all states under all circumstances and is explicitly forbidden by several treaties. 　Opposition to torture stimulated the formation of the human rights movement after World War II, and torture continues to be an important human rights issue. 　Although its incidence has declined, torture is still practiced by some countries.

<font size=3>
A seminary, school of theology, theological seminary, or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students (sometimes called seminarians) in scripture, theology, generally to prepare them for ordination to serve as clergy, in academics, or mostly in Christian ministry. 　The English word is taken from the Latin seminarium, translated as seed-bed, an image taken from the Council of Trent document Cum adolescentium aetas which called for the first modern seminaries. 　In the United States, the term is currently used for graduate-level theological institutions, but historically it was used for high schools.

Dame is an honorific title and the feminine form of address for the honour of damehood in many Christian chivalric orders, as well as the British honours system and those of several other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, with the masculine form of address being Sir. 　It is the female equivalent for knighthood, which is traditionally granted to males. 　Dame is also style used by baronetesses in their own right. 　A woman appointed to the grades of the Dame Commander or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint John, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Most Honourable Order of the Bath, the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, the Royal Victorian Order, or the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire becomes a dame. 　A Central European order in which female members receive the rank of Dame is the Imperial and Royal Order of Saint George. 　Since there is no female equivalent to a Knight Bachelor, women are always appointed to an order of chivalry. 　Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame.

<font size=3>
Graphics (from Ancient Greek γραφικός (graphikós) 'pertaining to drawing, painting, writing, etc.　') are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain. 　In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software. 　Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics. 　Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, mathematical graphs, line graphs, charts, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. 　Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. 　Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. 　The objective can be clarity or effective communication, association with other cultural elements, or merely the creation of a distinctive style. 　Graphics can be functional or artistic. 　The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred. 　It can also be used for architecture.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy>Conspiracy</a> 

<font size=3>
A conspiracy, also known as a plot, is a secret plan or agreement between people (called conspirers or conspirators) for an unlawful or harmful purpose, such as murder or treason, especially with political motivation, while keeping their agreement secret from the public or from other people affected by it. 　In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. 　Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may also be a crime, or a civil wrong. 　The term generally implies wrongdoing or illegality on the part of the conspirators, as people would not need to conspire to engage in activities that were lawful and ethical, or to which no one would object. 　There are some coordinated activities that people engage in with secrecy that are not generally thought of as conspiracies. 　For example, intelligence agencies such as the American CIA and the British MI6 necessarily make plans in secret to spy on suspected enemies of their respective countries, but this kind of activity is generally not considered to be a conspiracy so long as their goal is to fulfill their official functions, and not something like improperly enriching themselves. 　Similarly, the coaches of competing sports teams routinely meet behind closed doors to plan game strategies and specific plays designed to defeat their opponents, but this activity is not considered a conspiracy because this is considered a legitimate part of the sport. 　Furthermore, a conspiracy must be engaged in knowingly. 　The continuation of social traditions that work to the advantage of certain groups and to the disadvantage of certain other groups, though possibly unethical, is not a conspiracy if participants in the practice are not carrying it forward for the purpose of perpetuating this advantage. 　On the other hand, if the intent of carrying out a conspiracy exists, then there is a conspiracy even if the details are never agreed to aloud by the participants. 　CIA covert operations, for instance, are by their very nature hard to prove definitively but research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has suggested several cases where the agency tried to influence events. 　During the Cold War, the United States tried to covertly change other nations' governments 66 times, succeeding in 26 cases. 　A "conspiracy theory" is a belief that a conspiracy has actually been decisive in producing a political event of which the theorists strongly disapprove. 　Political scientist Michael Barkun has described conspiracy theories as relying on the view that the universe is governed by design, and embody three principles: nothing happens by accident, nothing is as it seems, and everything is connected. 　Another common feature is that conspiracy theories evolve to incorporate whatever evidence exists against them, so that they become, as Barkun writes, a closed system that is unfalsifiable, and therefore "a matter of faith rather than proof."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome>Dome</a> 

<font size=3>
A dome (from Latin domus) is an architectural element similar to the hollow upper half of a sphere. 　There is significant overlap with the term cupola, which may also refer to a dome or a structure on top of a dome. 　The precise definition of a dome has been a matter of controversy and there are a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. 　A dome can rest directly upon a rotunda wall, a drum, or a system of squinches or pendentives used to accommodate the transition in shape from a rectangular or square space to the round or polygonal base of the dome. 　The dome's apex may be closed or may be open in the form of an oculus, which may itself be covered with a roof lantern and cupola. 　Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory. 　Domes were built in ancient Mesopotamia, and they have been found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese architecture in the ancient world, as well as among a number of indigenous building traditions throughout the world. 　Dome structures were common in both Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, which influenced that of the rest of Europe and Islam, respectively, in the Middle Ages. 　The domes of European Renaissance architecture spread from Italy in the early modern period, while domes were frequently employed in Ottoman architecture at the same time. 　Baroque and Neoclassical architecture took inspiration from Roman domes. 　Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques resulted in new dome types. 　Domes have been constructed over the centuries from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic. 　The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary, celestial, and governmental traditions that have likewise altered over time. 　The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.

<font size=3>
A dome is a feature in structural geology consisting of symmetrical anticlines that intersect each other at their respective apices. 　Intact, domes are distinct, rounded, spherical-to-ellipsoidal-shaped protrusions on the Earth's surface. 　However, a transect parallel to Earth's surface of a dome features concentric rings of strata. 　Consequently, if the top of a dome has been eroded flat, the resulting structure in plan view appears as a bullseye, with the youngest rock layers at the outside, and each ring growing progressively older moving inwards. 　These strata would have been horizontal at the time of deposition, then later deformed by the uplift associated with dome formation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond>Raymond</a> 

<font size=3>
Raymond is a male given name. 　It was borrowed into English from French (older French spellings were Reimund and Raimund, whereas the modern English and French spellings are identical). 　It originated as the Germanic ᚱᚨᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Raginmund) or ᚱᛖᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Reginmund). 　Ragin (Gothic) and regin (Old German) meant "counsel". 　The Old High German mund originally meant "hand", but came to mean "protection". 　This etymology suggests that the name originated in the Early Middle Ages, possibly from Latin. 　Alternatively, the name can also be derived from Germanic Hraidmund, the first element being Hraid, possibly meaning "fame" (compare Hrod, found in names such as Robert, Roderick, Rudolph, Roland, Rodney and Roger) and mund meaning "protector". 　Despite the German and French origins of the English name, some of its early uses in English documents appear in Latinized form. 　As a surname, its first recorded appearance in Britain appeared in 1086, during the reign of William the Conqueror, in the Domesday Book, with a reference to Giraldus Reimundus. 　The most commonly used names for baby boys based on "Ragin" in 2009 were, in descending order, Raymond, Ramiro, Rayner, Rein, Reingard, Reynard, and Reynold. 　Its many other variants include Raiment, Raimo, Raimond, Raimondi, Raimondo, Raimund, Raimundo, Ramon, Ramón, Ramond, Ramondelli, Ramondenc, Ramondi, Ramondini, Ramondino, Ramondo, Ramondou, Ramonenc, Ramonic, Ramundi, Rayment, Raymonenc, Raymonencq, Raymont, Raymund, Redmond, Redmonds, Reim, Reimund, Reinmund, Rémon, Rémond, Remondeau, Remondon, Rémont, Reymond, Rimondi, and Rimondini.

<font size=3>
Leonard or Leo is a common English masculine given name and a surname. 　The given name and surname originate from the Old High German Leonhard containing the prefix levon ("lion") from the Greek Λέων ("lion") through the Latin Leo, and the suffix hardu ("brave" or "hardy"). 　The name has come to mean "lion strength", "lion-strong", or "lion-hearted". 　Leonard was the name of a Saint in the Middle Ages period, known as the patron saint of prisoners. 　Leonard is also an Irish origin surname, from the Gaelic O'Leannain also found as O'Leonard, but often was anglicised to just Leonard, consisting of the prefix O ("descendant of") and the suffix Leannan ("lover"). 　The oldest public records of the surname appear in 1272 in Huntingdonshire, England, and in 1479 in Ulm, Germany.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate>Chocolate</a> 

<font size=3>
Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. 　Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people ─ including the Maya and Aztecs ─ made chocolate beverages. 　The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. 　After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. 　The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. 　Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. 　The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. 　Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. 　Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. 　Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. 　Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. 　White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. 　Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. 　Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. 　Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. 　Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. 　Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao. 　Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply. 　With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns. 　A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.

Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa, [varˈʂava] (listen)), officially the Capital City of Warsaw, is the capital and largest city of Poland. 　The metropolis stands on the River Vistula in east-central Poland, and its population is officially estimated at 1.86 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.1 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 6th most-populous city in the European Union. 　The city area measures 517 km2 (200 sq mi) and comprises 18 districts, while the metropolitan area covers 6,100 km2 (2,355 sq mi). 　Warsaw is an Alpha global city, a major cultural, political and economic hub, and the country's seat of government. 　Warsaw traces its origins to a small fishing town in Masovia. 　The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century, when Sigismund III decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court from Kraków. 　Warsaw served as the de facto capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, and subsequently as the seat of Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw. 　The 19th century and its Industrial Revolution brought a demographic boom which made it one of the largest and most densely populated cities in Europe. 　Known then for its elegant architecture and boulevards, Warsaw was bombed and besieged at the start of World War II in 1939. 　Much of the historic city was destroyed and its diverse population decimated by the Ghetto Uprising in 1943, the general Warsaw Uprising in 1944 and systematic razing. 　Warsaw is served by two international airports, the busiest being Warsaw Chopin and the smaller Warsaw Modlin intended for low-cost carriers. 　Major public transport services operating in the city include the Warsaw Metro, buses, commuter rail service and an extensive tram network. 　The city is a significant centre of research and development, business process outsourcing, and information technology outsourcing. 　The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe. 　Frontex, the European Union agency for external border security, and ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have their headquarters in Warsaw. 　As of 2022, Warsaw has one of the highest number of skyscrapers in Europe while Varso Place is the tallest building in the European Union. 　The city is home to renowned universities such as the University of Warsaw, the Warsaw University of Technology, SGH Warsaw School of Economics, Chopin University of Music and Kozminski University. 　It also hosts the Polish Academy of Sciences, National Philharmonic Orchestra, the National Museum, Zachęta Art Gallery and the Warsaw Grand Theatre, the largest of its kind in the world. 　The reconstructed Old Town, which represents examples of nearly every European architectural style and historical period, was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1980. 　Other architectural attractions include the Royal Castle, Sigismund's Column, the Wilanów Palace, the Palace on the Isle, St. John's Archcathedral, Main Market Square, and numerous churches and mansions along the Royal Route. 　The Warsaw Zoo is among the largest and most-visited zoological gardens in the country. 　The city possesses thriving arts and club scenes, gourmet restaurants and large urban green spaces, with around a quarter of the city's area occupied by parks. 　In sports, the city is known as the home of the top-tier football club Legia Warsaw, the Warsaw Marathon and Poland's national football stadium Stadion Narodowy.

Coordinates: 45°10′N 15°30′E﻿ / ﻿45.167°N 15.500°E﻿ / 45.167; 15.500 Croatia (/kroʊˈeɪʃə/ (listen), kroh-AY-shə; Croatian: Hrvatska, pronounced [xř̩ʋaːtskaː]), officially the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Republika Hrvatska, (listen)), is a country at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe. 　Its coast lies entirely on the Adriatic Sea. 　It borders Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a maritime border with Italy to the west and southwest. 　Its capital and largest city, Zagreb, forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, with twenty counties. 　The country spans 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), and has a population of nearly 3.9 million. 　The Croats arrived in the late 6th century. 　By the 7th century, they had organized the territory into two duchies. 　Croatia was first internationally recognized as independent on 7 June 879 during the reign of Duke Branimir. 　Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. 　During the succession crisis after the Trpimirović dynasty ended, Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. 　In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne. 　In October 1918, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. 　Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, most of Croatia was incorporated into a Nazi-installed puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia. 　A resistance movement led to the creation of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 　On 25 June 1991, Croatia declared independence, and the War of Independence was successfully fought over the next four years. 　Croatia is a republic and a parliamentary liberal democracy. 　It is a member of the European Union, the Eurozone, the Schengen Area, NATO, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the World Trade Organization, and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean. 　An active participant in United Nations peacekeeping, Croatia contributed troops to the International Security Assistance Force and filled a nonpermanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term. 　Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors. 　Croatia is classified by the World Bank as a high-income economy and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. 　Service, industrial sectors, and agriculture dominate the economy. 　Tourism is a significant source of revenue for the country, which is ranked among the 20 most popular tourist destinations. 　The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. 　The European Union is Croatia's most important trading partner. 　Croatia provides social security, universal health care, and tuition-free primary and secondary education while supporting culture through public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing.

<font size=3>
In law, fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. 　Fraud can violate civil law (e.g., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation) or criminal law (e.g., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities), or it may cause no loss of money, property, or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. 　The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, for example by obtaining a passport, travel document, or driver's license, or mortgage fraud, where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements. 　Internal fraud, also known as "insider fraud", is fraud committed or attempted by someone within an organisation such as an employee. 　A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim.

<font size=3>
Oscar (oscara = "deer/god friend") is a figure in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. 　He is the son of Oisín (the son of the epic hero Fionn mac Cumhail) and Niamh, and the brother of Plor na mBan, his bride is called Malvina. 　Though possibly a later addition to the cycle, Oscar was a popular character, and appeared prominently in several later Fenian tales, serving his grandfather as one of the fianna. 　In Bruidhean Chaorthainn (Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees), Oscar swept off the head of Sinsar, the King of the World, in the battle on the ford of the Shannon River. 　His death is described in the story Cath Gabhra (The Battle of Gabhra), which pits the increasingly corrupt Fianna against the Army of the High King of Ireland, Cairbre Lifechair. 　Cairbre, aided by defected Fianna warriors loyal to Goll mac Morna, receives his death blow from Oscar, but mortally wounds him with his steel chains as his final act. 　Oscar's death causes Fionn to weep for the only time in his life, and serves as the final blow to the Fianna's strength.

Devon (/ˈdɛvən/ DEV-ən, also historically known as Devonshire /ˈdɛvənʃɪər, -ʃər/ DEV-ən-sheer, -⁠shər) is a ceremonial, non-metropolitan, and historic county in South West England. 　Devon is coastal with a variety of cliffs and sandy beaches. 　It has the largest open space in southern England, Dartmoor National Park. 　A predominately rural county, Devon has a relatively low population density for a county in England. 　Its most populous settlement is the City of Plymouth. 　The county town of Devon, the City of Exeter, is the second most populous settlement. 　The county is bordered by Somerset to the north east, Dorset to the east, and Cornwall to the west. 　Its economy is heavily orientated around the tourism and agriculture industries. 　Devon is administratively split into the non-metropolitan districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, West Devon, Exeter, and two unitary authority areas of Plymouth, and Torbay. 　Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is 6,707 km2 (2,590 square miles) and its population is about 1.2 million. 　The county derives its name from Dumnonia (the shift from m to v is a typical Celtic consonant shift). 　During the British Iron Age, Roman Britain and the early Middle Ages, this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts. 　The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries. 　The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the River Tamar by King Æthelstan in 936. 　Devon was later constituted as a shire of the Kingdom of England.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier>Frontier</a> 

<font size=3>
A frontier is the political and geographical area near or beyond a boundary. 　A frontier can also be referred to as a "front". 　The term came from French in the 15th century, with the meaning "borderland"—the region of a country that fronts on another country (see also marches). 　Unlike a border—a rigid and clear-cut form of state boundary—in the most general sense a frontier can be fuzzy or diffuse. 　For example, the frontier between the Eastern United States and the Old West in the 1800s was an area where European American settlements gradually thinned out and gave way to Native American settlements or uninhabited land. 　The frontier was not always a single continuous area, as California and various large cities were populated before the land that connected those to the East. 　Frontiers and borders also imply different geopolitical strategies. 　In Ancient Rome, the Roman Republic experienced a period of active expansion and creating new frontiers. 　From the reign of Augustus onward, the Roman borders turned into defensive boundaries that divided the Roman and non-Roman realms. 　In the eleventh-century China, China's Song Dynasty defended its northern border with the nomadic Liao empire by building an extensive manmade forest. 　Later in the early twelfth century, Song Dynasty invaded the Liao and dismantled the northern forest, converting the former defensive border into an expanding frontier. 　In modern history, colonialism and imperialism has applied and produced elaborate use and concepts of a frontier, especially in the settler colonial states of North America, expressed by the "Manifest Destiny" and "Frontier Thesis". 　Mobile frontiers was discussed during the Schengen convention. 　It was used by Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru to describe Mao Zedong's actions of grabbing Indian territory before and during the 1962 War through a creeping process. 　Albert Nevett, in his 1954 book "India Going Red?" wrote that "The Empire of Soviet Communism has 'mobile frontiers'".

<font size=3>
The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual collector. 　Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. 　The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others. 　In collections of manufactured items, the objects may be antique or simply collectable. 　Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. 　The word vintage describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. 　Collecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. 　Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. 　Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. 　The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(meteorology)>Accretion (meteorology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Accretion is defined as the gradual collection of something over time. 　In meteorology or atmospheric science it is the process of accumulation of frozen water as precipitation over time as it descends through the atmosphere, in particular when an ice crystal or snowflake hits a supercooled liquid droplet, which then freeze together, increasing the size of the water particle. 　The collection of these particles eventually forms snow or hail in clouds and depending on lower atmosphere temperatures may become rain, sleet, or graupel. 　Accretion is the basis for cloud formation and can also be seen as water accumulates on the particulate matter and form jet contrails. 　This is because water vapor in the air requires condensation nuclei to form large droplets of solid or liquid water.

A logo (abbreviation of logotype; from Ancient Greek λόγος (lógos) 'word, speech', and τύπος (túpos) 'mark, imprint') is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. 　It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a wordmark. 　In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF Garamond), as opposed to a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word. 　By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon. 　At the level of mass communication and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its trademark or brand.

Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite set of objects, i.e., determining the size of a set. 　The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. 　The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element. 　Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or "counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...). 　There is archaeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000 years. 　Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as the number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts (that is, accountancy). 　Notched bones were also found in the Border Caves in South Africa that may suggest that the concept of counting was known to humans as far back as 44,000 BCE. 　The development of counting led to the development of mathematical notation, numeral systems, and writing.

<font size=3>
Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. 　Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions. 　Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks. 　Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. 　Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. 　Archeological evidence of cooking fires from at least 300,000 years ago exists, but some estimate that humans started cooking up to 2 million years ago. 　The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. 　New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling of water, expanded cooking techniques. 　Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.

<font size=3>
A carriage is a private four-wheeled vehicle for people and is most commonly horse-drawn. 　Second-hand private carriages were common public transport, the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis. 　Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping and, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs. 　Two-wheeled carriages are informal and usually owner-driven. 　Coaches are a special category within carriages. 　They are carriages with four corner posts and a fixed roof. 　Two-wheeled war chariots and transport vehicles such as four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were forerunners of carriages. 　In the twenty-first century, horse-drawn carriages are occasionally used for public parades by royalty and for traditional formal ceremonies. 　Simplified modern versions are made for tourist transport in warm countries and for those cities where tourists expect open horse-drawn carriages to be provided. 　Simple metal sporting versions are still made for the sport known as competitive driving.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruz>Cruz</a> 

<font size=3>
Cruz is a surname of Iberian origin, first found in Castile,[citation needed] Spain, but later spread throughout the territories of the former Spanish and Portuguese Empires. 　In Spanish and Portuguese, the word means "cross", either the Christian cross or the figure of transecting lines or ways. 　For example, in the Philippines, the adopted Tagalog word is rendered to "krus" in plain usage, but the Spanish spelling survives as a surname. 　The word "Cruz" (Spanish for "Cross"), as well as "Vera Cruz" ("True Cross") and "Santa Cruz" ("Holy Cross") are used as surnames and toponyms. 　Its origin as a surname particularly flourished after the Alhambra Decree of 1492 and the increasing activities of the Spanish Inquisition, when New Christian families with Crypto-Jewish, Moorish, and/or mixed religious heritage converted to the state-enforced religion of Catholicism and subsequently fashioned and adopted surnames with unambiguous religious affiliation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon>Canyon</a> 

<font size=3>
A canyon (from Spanish: cañón; archaic British English spelling: cañon), or gorge, is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic time scales. 　Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces, eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream. 　A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation, which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains. 　The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. 　A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks, such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, the Himalayas or the Andes. 　Usually, a river or stream carves out such splits between mountains. 　Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California's Sierra Nevada. 　Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called box canyons. 　Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls. 　Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons. 　Unlike canyons on land, submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk>Monk</a> 

<font size=3>
A monk (/mʌŋk/, from Greek: μοναχός, monachos, "single, solitary" via Latin monachus) is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living, either alone or with any number of other monks. 　A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate their life to serving other people and serving God, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live their life in prayer and contemplation. 　The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. 　In the Greek language, the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is mainly in use for men. 　The word nun is typically used for female monastics. 　Although the term monachos is of Christian origin, in the English language monk tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds. 　However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as cenobite, hermit, anchorite, hesychast, or solitary. 　Traditions of Christian monasticism exist in major Christian denominations, with religious orders being present in Catholicism, Lutheranism, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Reformed Christianity, Anglicanism and Methodism. 　Indian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, also have monastic traditions as well.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton>Proton</a> 

<font size=3>
A proton is a stable subatomic particle, symbol p , H+, or 1H+ with a positive electric charge of +1 e (elementary charge). 　Its mass is slightly less than that of a neutron and 1,836 times the mass of an electron (the proton–electron mass ratio). 　Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are jointly referred to as "nucleons" (particles present in atomic nuclei). 　One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. 　They provide the attractive electrostatic central force that binds the atomic electrons. 　The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). 　Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number, which determines the number of atomic electrons and consequently the chemical characteristics of the element. 　The word proton is Greek for "first", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. 　In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. 　Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental or elementary particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. 　Although protons were originally considered to be elementary particles, in the modern Standard Model of particle physics, protons are now known to be composite particles, containing three valence quarks, and together with neutrons are now classified as hadrons. 　Protons are composed of two up quarks of charge +2/3e and one down quark of charge −1/3e. 　The rest masses of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass. 　The remainder of a proton's mass is due to quantum chromodynamics binding energy, which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together. 　Because protons are not fundamental particles, they possess a measurable size; the root mean square charge radius of a proton is about 0.84–0.87 fm (1 fm = 10−15 m). 　In 2019, two different studies, using different techniques, found this radius to be 0.833 fm, with an uncertainty of ±0.010 fm. 　Free protons occur occasionally on Earth: thunderstorms can produce protons with energies of up to several tens of MeV. 　At sufficiently low temperatures and kinetic energies, free protons will bind to electrons. 　However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. 　A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom. 　The result is a protonated atom, which is a chemical compound of hydrogen. 　In a vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical. 　Such "free hydrogen atoms" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. 　When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H2), which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space. 　Free protons are routinely used for accelerators for proton therapy or various particle physics experiments, with the most powerful example being the Large Hadron Collider.

<font size=3>
Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. 　The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including muntjac, elk (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose. 　Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. 　In this, they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). 　The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related to Cervidae. 　Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a role in mythology, religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the coat of arms of Åland. 　Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. 　Deer hunting has been a popular activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.

Shanghai (/ʃæŋˈhaɪ/; Chinese: 上海, Shanghainese: Zaon6he5 [zɑ̃̀.hɛ́] (listen), Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [ʂâŋ.xàɪ] (listen)) is one of the four direct-administered municipalities of the People's Republic of China (PRC). 　The city is located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River flowing through it. 　The population of the city proper is the third most populous in the world, with 24.89 million inhabitants in 2021, while the urban area is the most populous in China with 39,300,000 residents. 　As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion). 　Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port. 　Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. 　The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. 　The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. 　The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. 　During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. 　After the war, with the CPC takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined. 　By the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. 　The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. 　Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　As of 2022, it is home to 12 companies of the Fortune Global 500 and is ranked 4th on the Global Financial Centres Index. 　The city is also a center for research and development and home to many highly ranked Double First-Class Universities. 　The Shanghai Metro, first opened in 1993, is the largest metro network in the world by route length. 　Shanghai has been described as the "showpiece" of the booming economy of China. 　Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund, which includes Oriental Pearl TV Tower. 　Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive local language and vibrant international flair.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest>Conquest</a> 

<font size=3>
Conquest is the act of military subjugation of an enemy by force of arms. 　Military history provides many examples of conquest: the Roman conquest of Britain, the Mauryan conquest of Afghanistan and of vast areas of the Indian subcontinent, the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and various Muslim conquests, to mention just a few. 　The Norman conquest of England provides an example: it built on cultural ties, led to the subjugation of the Kingdom of England to Norman control and brought William the Conqueror to the English throne in 1066. 　Conquest may link in some ways with colonialism. 　England, for example, experienced phases and areas of Anglo-Saxon, Viking and Franco-Norman colonisation and conquest.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern>Stern</a> 

<font size=3>
The stern is the back or aft-most part of a ship or boat, technically defined as the area built up over the sternpost, extending upwards from the counter rail to the taffrail. 　The stern lies opposite the bow, the foremost part of a ship. 　Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came to refer to the entire back of a vessel. 　The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white navigation light at night. 　Sterns on European and American wooden sailing ships began with two principal forms: the square or transom stern and the elliptical, fantail, or merchant stern, and were developed in that order. 　The hull sections of a sailing ship located before the stern were composed of a series of U-shaped rib-like frames set in a sloped or "cant" arrangement, with the last frame before the stern being called the fashion timber(s) or fashion piece(s), so called for "fashioning" the after part of the ship. 　This frame is designed to support the various beams that make up the stern. 　In 1817 the British naval architect Sir Robert Seppings introduced the concept of the round or circular stern. 　The square stern had been an easy target for enemy cannon, and could not support the weight of heavy stern chase guns. 　But Seppings' design left the rudder head exposed, and was regarded by many as simply ugly—no American warships were designed with such sterns, and the round stern was quickly superseded by the elliptical stern. 　The United States began building the first elliptical stern warship in 1820, a decade before the British. 　USS Brandywine became the first sailing ship to sport such a stern. 　Though a great improvement over the transom stern in terms of its vulnerability to attack when under fire, elliptical sterns still had obvious weaknesses which the next major stern development — the iron-hulled cruiser stern — addressed far better and with significantly different materials.

<font size=3>
Accounting, also known as accountancy, is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial and non-financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. 　Accounting, which has been called the "language of business", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of stakeholders, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. 　Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. 　The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms. 　Accounting can be divided into several fields including financial accounting, management accounting, tax accounting and cost accounting. 　Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information, including the preparation of financial statements, to the external users of the information, such as investors, regulators and suppliers. 　Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information for internal use by management. 　The recording of financial transactions, so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as bookkeeping, of which double-entry bookkeeping is the most common system. 　Accounting information systems are designed to support accounting functions and related activities. 　Accounting has existed in various forms and levels of sophistication throughout human history. 　The double-entry accounting system in use today was developed in medieval Europe, particularly in Venice, and is usually attributed to the Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli. 　Today, accounting is facilitated by accounting organizations such as standard-setters, accounting firms and professional bodies. 　Financial statements are usually audited by accounting firms, and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 　GAAP is set by various standard-setting organizations such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States and the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom. 　As of 2012, "all major economies" have plans to converge towards or adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke>Joke</a> 

<font size=3>
A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is usually not meant to be interpreted literally. 　It usually takes the form of a story, often with dialogue, and ends in a punch line, whereby the humorous element of the story is revealed; this can be done using a pun or other type of word play, irony or sarcasm, logical incompatibility, hyperbole, or other means. 　Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition: A joke is a short humorous piece of oral literature in which the funniness culminates in the final sentence, called the punchline… In fact, the main condition is that the tension should reach its highest level at the very end. 　No continuation relieving the tension should be added. 　As for its being "oral," it is true that jokes may appear printed, but when further transferred, there is no obligation to reproduce the text verbatim, as in the case of poetry. 　It is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. 　In the case of riddle jokes or one-liners, the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. 　However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humour—the shaggy dog story is an example of an anti-joke; although presented as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a punchline. 　Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is in the form of a joke. 　Some humorous forms which are not verbal jokes are: involuntary humour, situational humour, practical jokes, slapstick and anecdotes. 　Identified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist André Jolles, jokes are passed along anonymously. 　They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. 　Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet. 　Stand-up comics, comedians and slapstick work with comic timing and rhythm in their performance, and may rely on actions as well as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. 　This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny".

In dynamical systems instability means that some of the outputs or internal states increase with time, without bounds. 　Not all systems that are not stable are unstable; systems can also be marginally stable or exhibit limit cycle behavior. 　In structural engineering, a structural beam or column can become unstable when excessive compressive load is applied. 　Beyond a certain threshold, structural deflections magnify stresses, which in turn increases deflections. 　This can take the form of buckling or crippling. 　The general field of study is called structural stability. 　Atmospheric instability is a major component of all weather systems on Earth.

Imprisonment is the restraint of a person's liberty, for any cause whatsoever, whether by authority of the government, or by a person acting without such authority. 　In the latter case it is "false imprisonment". 　Imprisonment does not necessarily imply a place of confinement, with bolts and bars, but may be exercised by any use or display of force (such as placing one in handcuffs), lawfully or unlawfully, wherever displayed, even in the open street. 　People become prisoners, wherever they may be, by the mere word or touch of a duly authorized officer directed to that end. 　Usually, however, imprisonment is understood to imply an actual confinement in a jail or prison employed for the purpose according to the provisions of the law. 　Sometimes gender imbalances occur in imprisonment rates, with incarceration of males proportionately more likely than incarceration of females.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtually>Virtually</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra that studies infinite groups, the adverb virtually is used to modify a property so that it need only hold for a subgroup of finite index. 　Given a property P, the group G is said to be virtually P if there is a finite index subgroup H ≤ G {\displaystyle H\leq G} such that H has property P. Common uses for this would be when P is abelian, nilpotent, solvable or free. 　For example, virtually solvable groups are one of the two alternatives in the Tits alternative, while Gromov's theorem states that the finitely generated groups with polynomial growth are precisely the finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups. 　This terminology is also used when P is just another group. 　That is, if G and H are groups then G is virtually H if G has a subgroup K of finite index in G such that K is isomorphic to H. In particular, a group is virtually trivial if and only if it is finite. 　Two groups are virtually equal if and only if they are commensurable.

Solomon (/ˈsɒləmən/; Hebrew: שְׁלֹמֹה‎, Modern: Šlōmō, Tiberian: Šălōmō, lit. 'peaceful'), also called Jedidiah (Hebrew: יְדִידְיָהּ‎, Modern: Yǝdīdǝyah, Tiberian: Yăḏīḏăyāh, "beloved of Yah"), was a monarch of ancient Israel and the son and successor of David, according to the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament. 　He is described as having been the penultimate ruler of an amalgamated Israel and Judah. 　The hypothesized dates of Solomon's reign are 970–931 BCE. 　After his death, his son and successor Rehoboam would adopt harsh policy towards the northern tribes, eventually leading to the splitting of the Israelites between the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. 　Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. 　The Bible says Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem, dedicating the temple to Yahweh, or God in Judaism. 　Solomon is portrayed as wealthy, wise and powerful, and as one of the 48 Jewish prophets. 　He is also the subject of many later references and legends, most notably in the Testament of Solomon (part of first-century biblical apocrypha). 　In the New Testament, he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by Jesus of Nazareth, and as arrayed in glory but excelled by "the lilies of the field". 　In the Quran, he is considered to be a major Islamic prophet and is generally referred to as Sulaiman ibn Dawud (Arabic: سُلَيْمَان بْن دَاوُوْد, lit. 'Solomon, son of David'). 　In mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.

<font size=3>
A ritual is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or objects, performed according to a set sequence. 　Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. 　Rituals are characterized, but not defined, by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. 　Rituals are a feature of all known human societies. 　They include not only the worship rites and sacraments of organized religions and cults, but also rites of passage, atonement and purification rites, oaths of allegiance, dedication ceremonies, coronations and presidential inaugurations, marriages, funerals and more. 　Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying "hello" may be termed as rituals. 　The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. 　One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or "etic" category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. 　The term can be used also by the insider or "emic" performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker. 　In psychology, the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.

Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ KERR-ə-lə; Malayalam: [ke:ɾɐɭɐm] (listen)) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. 　It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Thiruvithamkoor. 　Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. 　It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. 　With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. 　It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. 　Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state. 　The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. 　The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). 　The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. 　The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. 　In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. 　At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Thiruvithamkoor and Cochin. 　They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. 　The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. 　After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks). 　Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. 　Kerala is the second-least impoverished state in India according to the Annual Report of Reserve Bank of India published in 2013. 　Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. 　The state topped in the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in 2019. 　The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly Malayalam and sometimes English. 　Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. 　The economy of Kerala is the 8th-largest in India with ₹8.55 trillion (US$110 billion) in gross state domestic product (GSDP) and a per capita net state domestic product of ₹222,000 (US$2,800). 　The tertiary sector contributes around 65% to state's GSVA, while the primary sector contributes only 8%. 　The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. 　The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. 　In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. 　The state is situated between Arabian Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain ranges to the east. 　The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370 mi), and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. 　Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with coconut-lined sandy beaches, backwaters, hill stations, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline>Airline</a> 

<font size=3>
An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and/or freight. 　Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight. 　Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. 　Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators. 　The first airline was the German airship company DELAG, founded on November 16, 1909. 　The four oldest non-airship airlines that still exist are the Netherlands' KLM (1919), Colombia's Avianca (1919), Australia's Qantas (1920) and the Czech Republic's Czech Airlines (1923). 　Airline ownership has seen a shift from mostly personal ownership until the 1930s to government-ownership of major airlines from the 1940s to 1980s and back to large-scale privatization following the mid-1980s. 　Since the 1980s, there has also been a trend of major airline mergers and the formation of airline alliances. 　The largest alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam and Oneworld, and these three collectively account for more than 60% of global commercial air traffic in 2015. 　Airline alliances coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and frequent-flyer programs), offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). 　As of 2019[update], the largest airline by passengers carried and fleet size was the American Airlines Group, while Delta Air Lines was the largest by revenue. 　Lufthansa Group was the largest by number of employees, FedEx Express by freight ton-kilometers, Turkish Airlines by number of countries served and UPS Airlines by number of destinations served (though United Airlines was the largest passenger airline by number of destinations served).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession>Profession</a> 

<font size=3>
A profession is a field of work that has been successfully professionalized. 　It can be defined as a disciplined group of individuals, professionals, who adhere to ethical standards and who hold themselves out as, and are accepted by the public as possessing special knowledge and skills in a widely recognised body of learning derived from research, education and training at a high level, and who are prepared to apply this knowledge and exercise these skills in the interest of others. 　Professional occupations are founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain. 　Medieval and early modern tradition recognized only three professions: divinity, medicine, and law, which were called the learned professions. 　A profession is not a trade and not an industry. 　Some professions change slightly in status and power, but their prestige generally remains stable over time, even if the profession begins to have more required study and formal education. 　Disciplines formalized more recently, such as architecture, now have equally long periods of study associated with them. 　Although professions may enjoy relatively high status and public prestige, not all professionals earn high salaries, and even within specific professions there exist significant differences in salary. 　In law, for example, a corporate defense lawyer working on an hourly basis may earn several times what a prosecutor or public defender earns.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_(pharmacology)>Elimination (pharmacology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In pharmacology the elimination or excretion of a drug is understood to be any one of a number of processes by which a drug is eliminated (that is, cleared and excreted) from an organism either in an unaltered form (unbound molecules) or modified as a metabolite. 　The kidney is the main excretory organ although others exist such as the liver, the skin, the lungs or glandular structures, such as the salivary glands and the lacrimal glands. 　These organs or structures use specific routes to expel a drug from the body, these are termed elimination pathways: Urine Tears Perspiration Saliva Respiration Milk Faeces Bile Drugs are excreted from the kidney by glomerular filtration and by active tubular secretion following the same steps and mechanisms as the products of intermediate metabolism. 　Therefore, drugs that are filtered by the glomerulus are also subject to the process of passive tubular reabsorption. 　Glomerular filtration will only remove those drugs or metabolites that are not bound to proteins present in blood plasma (free fraction) and many other types of drugs (such as the organic acids) are actively secreted. 　In the proximal and distal convoluted tubules non-ionised acids and weak bases are reabsorbed both actively and passively. 　Weak acids are excreted when the tubular fluid becomes too alkaline and this reduces passive reabsorption. 　The opposite occurs with weak bases. 　Poisoning treatments use this effect to increase elimination, by alkalizing the urine causing forced diuresis which promotes excretion of a weak acid, rather than it getting reabsorbed. 　As the acid is ionised, it cannot pass through the plasma membrane back into the blood stream and instead gets excreted with the urine. 　Acidifying the urine has the same effect for weakly basic drugs. 　On other occasions drugs combine with bile juices and enter the intestines. 　In the intestines the drug will join with the unabsorbed fraction of the administered dose and be eliminated with the faeces or it may undergo a new process of absorption to eventually be eliminated by the kidney. 　The other elimination pathways are less important in the elimination of drugs, except in very specific cases, such as the respiratory tract for alcohol or anaesthetic gases. 　The case of mother's milk is of special importance. 　The liver and kidneys of newly born infants are relatively undeveloped and they are highly sensitive to a drug's toxic effects. 　For this reason it is important to know if a drug is likely to be eliminated from a woman's body if she is breast feeding in order to avoid this situation.

<font size=3>
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. 　The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. 　Casting materials are usually metals or various time setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. 　Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. 　Heavy equipment like machine tool beds, ships' propellers, etc. can be cast easily in the required size, rather than fabricating by joining several small pieces. 　Casting is a 7,000-year-old process. 　The oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 BC.

A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. 　It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 　A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted △ A B C {\displaystyle \triangle ABC} . 　In Euclidean geometry, any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space). 　In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. 　If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. 　This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.

<font size=3>
In law, a conviction is the verdict reached by a court of law finding a defendant guilty of a crime. 　The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, "not guilty"). 　In Scotland, there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which is considered an acquittal. 　Sometimes, despite a defendant being found guilty, the court may order that the defendant not be convicted. 　This is known as a discharge and is used in countries such as England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 　The criminal justice system is not perfect and there are instances in which guilty defendants are acquitted and innocent people are convicted. 　Appeal mechanisms and post conviction relief procedures may help to address this issue to some extent. 　An error leading to the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice. 　After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment. 　In addition to the sentence, a conviction can also have other consequences, known as collateral consequences of criminal charges. 　These can include impacts on employment, housing, and other areas of an individual's life. 　A minor conviction is a warning conviction that does not affect the defendant but serves as a warning.　[citation needed] A person's history of convictions is known as their antecedents or "previous" in the United Kingdom and "priors" in the United States and Australia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto>Otto</a> 

<font size=3>
Otto is a masculine German given name and a surname. 　It originates as an Old High German short form (variants Audo, Odo, Udo) of Germanic names beginning in aud-, an element meaning "wealth, prosperity". 　The name is recorded from the 7th century (Odo, son of Uro, courtier of Sigebert III). 　It was the name of three 10th-century German kings, the first of whom was Otto I the Great, the first Holy Roman Emperor, founder of the Ottonian dynasty. 　The Gothic form of the prefix was auda- (as in e.g. Audaþius), the Anglo-Saxon form was ead- (as in e.g. Eadmund), and the Old Norse form was auð-. 　The given name Otis arose from an English surname, which was in turn derived from Ode, a variant form of Odo, Otto. 　Due to Otto von Bismarck, the given name Otto was strongly associated with the German Empire in the later 19th century. 　It was comparatively frequently given in the United States (presumably in German American families) during the 1880s to 1890s, remaining in the top 100 most popular masculine given names in the US throughout 1880–1898, but its popularity decreased significantly after 1900 with increasing anti-German sentiment leading up to World War I; it fell below rank 200 in 1919, below rank 500 in 1947, and below rank 1000 in 1975; it re-entered the top-1000 most popular given names in the US only in the 2010s, ranking 696th as of 2013.

<font size=3>
A sequel is a work of literature, film, theatre, television, music or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. 　In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work. 　In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. 　A sequel can lead to a series, in which key elements appear repeatedly. 　Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some media franchises have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as such or not.　[citation needed] Sequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings. 　Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels financially appealing. 　In film, sequels are very common. 　There are many name formats for sequels. 　Sometimes, they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added on the end. 　More commonly, they have numbers at the end or have added words on the end.　[citation needed] It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or have a subtitle. 　In the 1930s, many musical sequels had the year included in the title. 　Sometimes sequels are released with different titles in different countries, because of the perceived brand recognition. 　There are several ways that subsequent works can be related to the chronology of the original. 　Various neologisms have been coined to describe them.

Treasure (from Latin: thesaurus from Greek language θησαυρός thēsauros, "treasure store") is a concentration of wealth — often originating from ancient history — that is considered lost and/or forgotten until rediscovered. 　Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure, such as in the British Treasure Act 1996. 　The phrase "blood and treasure" has been used to refer to the human and monetary costs associated with massive endeavours such as war that expend both. 　Searching for hidden treasure is a common theme in legend; treasure hunters do exist, and can seek lost wealth for a living.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult>Cult</a> 

<font size=3>
In Modern English, cult is a term, considered pejorative by some, for a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals, or its common interest in a particular personality, object, or goal. 　This sense of the term is controversial and weakly defined, – having divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia – and has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.　: 348–356  An older sense of the word involves a set of religious devotional practices that is conventional within its culture, is related to a particular figure, and is frequently associated with a particular place. 　References to the "cult" of a particular Catholic saint, or references to the imperial cult of ancient Rome, for example, use the word in this sense. 　While the word is still being used in its literal and original sense, a derived sense of "excessive devotion" arose in the 19th century. 　Then, beginning in the 1930s, cults became an object of sociological study within the context of the study of religious behavior. 　Since the 1940s, the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements, labeling them "cults" because of their unorthodox beliefs. 　Since the 1970s, the secular anti-cult movement has opposed certain groups and, as a reaction to acts of violence, frequently charged those cults with practicing mind control. 　Scholars and the media have disputed some of the claims and actions of anti-cult movements, leading to further public controversy. 　Sociological classifications of religious movements may identify a cult as a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. 　Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults, saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. 　Groups labelled as "cults" range in size from local groups with a few followers to international organizations with millions of adherents.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom>Atom</a> 

<font size=3>
An atom is a particle that consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons. 　The atom is the basic particle of the chemical elements, and the chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. 　For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. 　The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. 　Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. 　A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. 　This is smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. 　Atoms are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects. 　More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. 　The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. 　If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. 　If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions. 　The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. 　The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. 　This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. 　Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. 　In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. 　This is a form of nuclear decay. 　Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. 　The ability of atoms to attach and detach is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. 　Chemistry is the discipline that studies these changes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favourite>Favourite</a> 

<font size=3>
A favourite (British English) or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. 　In post-classical and early-modern Europe, among other times and places, the term was used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. 　It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. 　From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, particularly in Spain, England, France and Sweden. 　The term is also sometimes employed by writers who want to avoid terms such as "royal mistress", "friend", "companion", or "lover" (of any gender). 　Several favourites had sexual relations with the monarch (or the monarch's spouse), but the feelings of the monarch for the favourite ran the gamut from simple faith in the favourite's abilities to various degrees of emotional affection and dependence, and sometimes even encompassed sexual infatuation. 　The term has an inbuilt element of disapproval and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "One who stands unduly high in the favour of a prince", citing Shakespeare: "Like favourites/ Made proud by Princes" (Much Ado about Nothing, 3.1.9).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher>Philosopher</a> 

<font size=3>
A philosopher is a person who practices or investigates philosophy. 　The term philosopher comes from the Ancient Greek: φιλόσοφος, romanized: philosophos, meaning 'lover of wisdom'. 　The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BCE). 　In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing upon resolving existential questions about the human condition; it was not necessary that they discoursed upon theories or commented upon authors. 　Those who most arduously committed themselves to this lifestyle would have been considered philosophers. 　In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who contributes to one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of science, logic, metaphysics, social theory, philosophy of religion, and political philosophy. 　A philosopher may also be someone who has worked in the humanities or other sciences which over the centuries have split from philosophy, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics.

In geology and physical geography, a plateau (/pləˈtoʊ, plæˈtoʊ, ˈplætoʊ/; French: [plato]; pl. plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or a tableland, is an area of a highland consisting of flat terrain that is raised sharply above the surrounding area on at least one side. 　Often one or more sides have deep hills or escarpments. 　Plateaus can be formed by a number of processes, including upwelling of volcanic magma, extrusion of lava, and erosion by water and glaciers. 　Plateaus are classified according to their surrounding environment as intermontane, piedmont, or continental. 　A few plateaus may have a small flat top while others have wider ones.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet>Hamlet</a> 

<font size=3>
The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (/ˈhæmlɪt/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. 　It is Shakespeare's longest play, with 29,551 words. 　Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. 　Hamlet is considered among the "most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language", with a story capable of "seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others". 　There are many works that have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare's play—from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan plays. 　The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of "source hunting", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. 　When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. 　This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, and printed in Paris in 1514. 　The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. 　It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's Hamlet, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. 　Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after Hamlet had been written, though it's possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version. 　Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). 　Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.

A doctorate (from Latin docere, "to teach"), doctor's degree (from Latin doctor, "teacher"), or doctoral degree is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities and some other educational institutions, derived from the ancient formalism licentia docendi ("licence to teach"). 　In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. 　There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines. 　In the United States and some other countries, there are also some types of technical or professional degrees that include "doctor" in their name and are classified as a doctorate in some of those countries. 　Professional doctorates historically came about to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines. 　Many universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or other contributions to the university or society.

<font size=3>
Ghana (/ˈɡɑːnə/ (listen); Twi: Gaana, Ewe: Gana), officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa. 　It abuts the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, sharing borders with Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, and Togo in the east. 　Ghana covers an area of 238,535 km2 (92,099 sq mi), spanning diverse biomes that range from coastal savannas to tropical rainforests. 　With nearly 31 million inhabitants (according to the 2021[update] census), Ghana is the second-most populous country in West Africa, after Nigeria. 　The capital and largest city is Accra; other major cities are Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi. 　The first permanent state in present-day Ghana was the Bono state of the 11th century. 　Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful were the Kingdom of Dagbon in the north and the Ashanti Empire in the south. 　Beginning in the 15th century, the Portuguese Empire, followed by numerous other European powers, contested the area for trading rights, until the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century. 　Following over a century of colonisation, Ghana's current borders took shape, encompassing four separate British colonial territories: Gold Coast, Ashanti, the Northern Territories, and British Togoland. 　These were unified as an independent dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations on 6 March 1957, becoming the first colony in West Africa to achieve sovereignty. 　Ghana subsequently became influential in decolonisation efforts and the Pan-African movement. 　Ghana is a multi-ethnic country with a diverse population, linguistic and religious groups; while the Akan are the largest ethnic group, they constitute only a plurality. 　Most Ghanaians are Christians (71.3%); almost a fifth are Muslims; a tenth practise traditional faiths or report no religion. 　Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is both head of state and head of government. 　Ghana has maintained since 1993 one of the freest and most stable governments on the continent, and it performs relatively well in healthcare, economic growth, and human development, so that it has a significant influence in West Africa and is highly integrated in international affairs, being a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, African Union, Economic Community of West African States, Group of 24, and Commonwealth of Nations.

<font size=3>
A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light beam by means of refraction. 　A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. 　Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic and are ground, polished, or molded to the required shape. 　A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. 　Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called "lenses", such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses. 　Lenses are used in various imaging devices like telescopes, binoculars, and cameras. 　They are also used as visual aids in glasses to correct defects of vision such as myopia and hypermetropia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(hydrology)>Lens (hydrology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In hydrology, a lens, also called freshwater lens or Ghyben-Herzberg lens, is a convex-shaped layer of fresh groundwater that floats above the denser saltwater and is usually found on small coral or limestone islands and atolls. 　This aquifer of fresh water is recharged through precipitation that infiltrates the top layer of soil and percolates downward until it reaches the saturated zone. 　The recharge rate of the lens can be summarized by the following equation: R = p − E T {\displaystyle R=p-ET} Where R {\displaystyle R} is the recharge rate in meters, p {\displaystyle p} is precipitation (m), and E T {\displaystyle ET} is evapotranspiration (m) of water. 　With higher amounts of recharge, the hydraulic head is increased, and a thick freshwater lens is maintained through the dry season. 　Lower rates of precipitation or higher rates of interception and evapotranspiration will decrease the hydraulic head, resulting in a thin lens.

<font size=3>
In geology, a lens or lentil is a body of ore or rock that is thick in the middle and thin at the edges, resembling a convex lens in cross-section. 　To thin out in all directions is to "lens out", also known as "lensing". 　The adjectives "lenticular" and "lentiform" are used to describe lens-like formations. 　Lenticle is a synonym for lentil, but may also refer to a fragment of rock that is lens-shaped. 　"Lenticule" is used for small lentil. 　A lentil may also refer a minor unit in a formation of rock, similar to a member but not generally spread out over a large geographical area. 　In this usage, the lentil thins out towards its edges. 　Lenticular bedding is a special form of rock interbedded mudrock and cross-laminated rippled sandstone. 　The lenses or ripples in lenticular beds are discontinuous in all directions.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape>Rape</a> 

<font size=3>
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without their consent. 　The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent. 　The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault. 　The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. 　Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median. 　Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females. 　Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape. 　Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. 　These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. 　Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. 　People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop post-traumatic stress disorder. 　Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. 　A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, sometimes, from the victim's family and relatives.

<font size=3>
An arrow is a fin-stabilized projectile launched by a bow. 　A typical arrow usually consists of a long, stiff, straight shaft with a weighty (and usually sharp and pointed) arrowhead attached to the front end, multiple fin-like stabilizers called fletchings mounted near the rear, and a slot at the rear end called a nock for engaging the bowstring. 　A container or bag carrying additional arrows for convenient reloading is called a quiver. 　The use of bows and arrows by humans predates recorded history and is common to most cultures. 　A craftsman who makes arrows is a fletcher, and one that makes arrowheads is an arrowsmith.

<font size=3>
In poetry and literature, a shade (translating Greek σκιά, Latin umbra) is the spirit or ghost of a dead person, residing in the underworld. 　An underworld where the dead live in shadow was common to beliefs in the ancient Near East. 　In Biblical Hebrew, it was called tsalmaveth (צַלמָוֶת: lit. "death-shadow", "shadow of death") as an alternate term for Sheol. 　The Witch of Endor in the First Book of Samuel notably conjures the ghost (owb) of Samuel. 　Only select individuals were believed to be exempt from the fate of dwelling in shadow after death. 　They would instead ascend to the divine sphere, as is reflected in the veneration of heroes. 　Plutarch relates how Alexander the Great was inconsolable after the death of Hephaistion up to the moment he received an oracle of Ammon confirming that the deceased was a hero, i.e. enjoyed the status of a divinity. 　Shades appear in Book Eleven of Homer's Odyssey, when Odysseus descends into Hades, and in Book Six of Virgil's Aeneid, when Aeneas travels to the underworld. 　In the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, many of the dead are similarly referred to as shades (Italian ombra), including Dante's guide, Virgil. 　The phrase "peace to thy gentle shade [and endless rest]" is sometimes seen in epitaphs, and was used by Alexander Pope in his epitaph for Nicholas Rowe.

A fence is a structure that encloses an area, typically outdoors, and is usually constructed from posts that are connected by boards, wire, rails or netting. 　A fence differs from a wall in not having a solid foundation along its whole length. 　Alternatives to fencing include a ditch (sometimes filled with water, forming a moat).
