## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather>Weather</a> 
<font size=3>
Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. 　On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. 　Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. 　When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth. 　Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. 　These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. 　The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. 　Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. 　Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. 　On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually. 　Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change. 　Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. 　Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. 　Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. 　Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. 　Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. 　A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. 　However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. 　A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. 　The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height>Height</a> 
<font size=3>
Height is measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how "tall" something or someone is) or vertical position (how "high" a point is). 　For example, "The height of that building is 50 m" or "The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m". 　For example, "Christopher Columbus is 5 foot 2 inches in vertical height." 　When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude. 　Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation. 　In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value. 　If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero. 　In the case of three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or "above") the x-y plane.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_(zoology)>Display (zoology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli. 　These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well. 　Evolution has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an ecosystem. 　It is connected to sexual selection and survival of the species in various ways. 　Typically, display behaviour is used for courtship between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate. 　In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group. 　A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed. 　Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours - from invertebrates such as the simple jumping spider to the more complex vertebrates like the harbour seal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance>Alliance</a> 
<font size=3>
An alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out among them. 　Members of an alliance are called allies. 　Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances. 　When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II. 　A formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. 　According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war. 　When spelled with a capital "A", "Allies" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). 　The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. 　The Allied Powers in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. 　Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat. 　After the end of World War II and during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed as a political and military alliance that promotes anti-communist values. 　More recently, the term "Allied forces" has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as "Coalition forces" or, as by the George W. Bush administration, "the coalition of the willing".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine>Wine</a> 
<font size=3>
Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. 　Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. 　Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. 　These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. 　Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. 　These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. 　Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of other crops including rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry. 　Wine has been produced for thousands of years. 　The earliest evidence of wine is from the Caucasus region in today's Georgia (6000 BCE), Persia (5000 BCE), Italy and Armenia (4000 BCE). 　New World wine has some connection to alcoholic beverages made by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, but is mainly connected to later Spanish traditions in New Spain. 　Later, as Old World wine further developed viticulture techniques, Europe would encompass three of the largest wine-producing regions. 　Today, the five countries with the largest wine producing regions are in Italy, Spain, France, the United States, and China. 　Wine has long played an important role in religion. 　Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, and Christianity in the Eucharist. 　Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. 　Similarly the largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California.

<font size=3>
Philadelphia, often called Philly, is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the second largest city in both the Northeast megalopolis and Mid-Atlantic regions after New York City. 　It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States, and once served as the nation's capital city until 1800. 　The city's population at the 2020 census was 1,603,797, and over 56 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of Philadelphia. 　Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the Delaware Valley, the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions with 6.245 million residents in 2020. 　Philadelphia is known both for its extensive contributions to American history and for its role in the life sciences, business and industry, art, literature, and music. 　Philadelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. 　The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence. 　Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774 following the Boston Tea Party, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as "the most potent and consequential words in American history". 　Once the Revolutionary War commenced, both the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. 　The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. 　Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 while the new national capital of Washington, D.C., was under construction. 　With 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research. 　As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$479 billion. 　The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022. 　The Philadelphia skyline, which includes several globally renowned commercial skyscrapers, is expanding, primarily with new residential high-rise condominiums. 　Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley are a biotechnology and venture capital hub; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by NASDAQ, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading. 　30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, including Philadelphia International Airport, the PhilaPort seaport, freight rail infrastructure, roadway traffic capacity, and warehouse storage space, are all expanding. 　Philadelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation. 　Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park. 　The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties. 　With five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans. 　The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. 　Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock. 　Philadelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731), hospital (1751), medical school (1765), national capital (1774), university (by some accounts) (1779), stock exchange (1790), zoo (1874), and business school (1881). 　Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall. 　From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. 　In 2021, Time magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas>Christmas</a> 
<font size=3>
Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. 　A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. 　Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it. 　The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. 　When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word. 　There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25. 　This corresponds to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. 　It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. 　Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. 　However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. 　For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas. 　The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. 　Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. 　In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. 　Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. 　Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.

<font size=3>
Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, and may be viewed as the opposite of success. 　The criteria for failure depends on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. 　One person might consider a failure what another person considers a success, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. 　Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a failure, another might consider to be a success, a qualified success or a neutral situation. 　It may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. 　Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the success or failure of a situation may itself be a significant task.

<font size=3>
An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. 　Uncles who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. 　The female counterpart of an uncle is an aunt, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece. 　The word comes from Latin: avunculus, the diminutive of avus (grandfather), and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. 　In some cultures and families, children may refer to the cousins of their parents as uncle (or aunt). 　It is also used as a title of respect for older relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, family friends, and even total strangers in some cultures, for example Aboriginal Australian elders. 　Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship. 　Any social institution where a special relationship exists between a man and his sisters' children is known as an avunculate (or avunculism or avuncularism). 　This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. 　Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and matrilineal descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty>Treaty</a> 
<font size=3>
A treaty is a formal, legally binding written agreement between actors in international law. 　It is usually made by and between sovereign states, but can include international organizations, individuals, business entities, and other legal persons. 　A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms. 　However, only documents that are legally binding on the parties are considered treaties under international law. 　Treaties vary on the basis of obligations (the extent to which states are bound to the rules), precision (the extent to which the rules are unambiguous), and delegation (the extent to which third parties have authority to interpret, apply and make rules). 　Treaties are among the earliest manifestations of international relations, with the first known example being a border agreement between the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma around 3100 BC. 　International agreements were used in some form by most major civilizations, growing in both sophistication and number during the early modern era. 　The early 19th century saw developments in diplomacy, foreign policy, and international law reflected by the widespread use of treaties. 　The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codified these practices, setting forth guidelines and rules for creating, amending, interpreting, and terminating treaties and for resolving disputes and alleged breaches. 　Treaties are roughly analogous to contracts in that they establish the rights and binding obligations of the parties. 　They vary significantly in form, substance, and complexity and govern a wide variety of matters, such as security, trade, environment, and human rights. 　Treaties may be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (involving more than two countries). 　They may also be used to establish international institutions, such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations, for which they often provide a governing framework. 　Treaties serve as primary sources of international law and have codified or established most international legal principles since the early 20th century. 　Notwithstanding the Law of Treaties and customary international law, treaties are not required to follow any standard form. 　Nevertheless, all valid treaties must comply with the legal principle of pacta sunt servanda (Latin: "agreements must be kept"), under which parties are committed to perform their duties and honor their agreements in good faith. 　A treaty may also be invalidated, and thus rendered unenforceable, if it violates a preemptory norm (jus cogens), such as permitting a war of aggression or crimes against humanity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)>Mechanism (biology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In the science of biology, a mechanism is a system of causally interacting parts and processes that produce one or more effects. 　Scientists explain phenomena by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of biological evolution; other mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. 　In ecology, mechanisms such as predation and host-parasite interactions produce change in ecological systems. 　In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(sociology)>Mechanism (sociology)</a> 
<font size=3>
The term social mechanisms and mechanism-based explanations of social phenomena originate from the philosophy of science. 　The core thinking behind the mechanism approach has been expressed as follows by Elster (1989: 3-4): “To explain an event is to give an account of why it happened. Usually… this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause of the event we want to explain…. [But] to cite the cause is not enough: the causal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.” 　Existing definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them all is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by specifying in detail how they were brought about. 　The currently most satisfactory discussion of the mechanism concept is found in Machamer, Darden and Craver (2000). 　Following them, mechanisms can be said to consist of entities (with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either by themselves or in concert with other entities. 　These activities bring about change, and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and activities of the entities and the relations between them. 　A mechanism, thus defined, refers to a constellation of entities and activities that are organized such that they regularly bring about a particular type of outcome, and we explain an observed outcome by referring to the mechanism by which such outcomes are regularly brought about (see also Hedström and Ylikoski 2010).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy>Strategy</a> 
<font size=3>
Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship") is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty. 　In the sense of the "art of the general", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. 　From then until the 20th century, the word "strategy" came to denote "a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. 　Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. 　Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. 　A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). 　Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. 　It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking. 　Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning, while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value – choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals. 　while Max McKeown (2011) argues that "strategy is about shaping the future" and is the human attempt to get to "desirable ends with available means". 　Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as "a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully." 　Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail>Trail</a> 
<font size=3>
A trail, also known as a path or track, is an unpaved lane or small road usually passing through a natural area. 　In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a path or footpath is the preferred term for a pedestrian or hiking trail. 　The term is also applied in North America to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways. 　In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by explorers and migrants (e.g. the Oregon Trail). 　In the United States, "trace" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace. 　Some trails are dedicated only for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing, but not more than one use; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians alike. 　There are also unpaved trails used by dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles, and in some places, like the Alps, trails are used for moving cattle and other livestock.
