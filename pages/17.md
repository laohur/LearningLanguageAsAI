## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excuse>Excuse</a> 

<font size=3>
In jurisprudence, an excuse is a defense to criminal charges that is distinct from an exculpation. 　Justification and excuse are different defenses in a criminal case (See Justification and excuse). 　Exculpation is a related concept which reduces or extinguishes a person's culpability, such as a their liability to pay compensation to the victim of a tort in the civil law. 　The excuse provides a mitigating factor for a group of persons sharing a common characteristic. 　Justification, as in justifiable homicide, vindicates or shows the justice. 　Thus, society approves of the purpose or motives underpinning some actions or the consequences flowing from them (see Robinson[clarification needed]), and distinguishes those where the behavior cannot be approved but some excuse may be found in the characteristics of the defendant, e.g. that the accused was a serving police officer or suffering from a mental illness. 　Thus, a justification describes the quality of the act, whereas an excuse relates to the status or capacity (or lack of it) in the accused. 　These factors can affect the resulting judgment which may be an acquittal, or in the case of a conviction may mitigate sentencing. 　An excuse may also be something that a person or persons use to explain any criticism or comments based on the outcome of any specific event.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning>Lightning</a> 

<font size=3>
Lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during which two electrically charged regions, both in the atmosphere or with one on the ground, temporarily neutralize themselves, causing the instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy. 　This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. 　Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. 　Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. 　The three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single thundercloud (intra-cloud), between two clouds (cloud-to-cloud), or between a cloud and the ground (cloud-to-ground). 　Many other observational variants are recognized, including "heat lightning", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; dry lightning, which can cause forest fires; and ball lightning, which is rarely observed scientifically. 　Humans have deified lightning for millennia. 　Idiomatic expressions derived from lightning, such as the English expression "bolt from the blue", are common across languages. 　At all times people have been fascinated by the sight and difference of lightning. 　The fear of lightning is called astraphobia. 　The first known photograph of lightning is from 1847, by Thomas Martin Easterly. 　The first surviving photograph is from 1882, by William Nicholson Jennings, a photographer who spent half his life capturing pictures of lightning and proving its diversity.

<font size=3>
A goddess is a female deity. 　In many known cultures, goddesses are often linked with literal or metaphorical pregnancy or imagined feminine roles associated with how women and girls are perceived or expected to behave. 　This includes themes of spinning, weaving, beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, domesticity, creativity, and fertility (exemplified by the ancient mother goddess cult). 　Many major goddesses are also associated with magic, war, strategy, hunting, farming, wisdom, fate, earth, sky, power, laws, justice, and more. 　Some themes, such as discord or disease, which are considered negative within their cultural contexts also are found associated with some goddesses. 　There are as many differently described and understood goddesses as there are male, shapeshifting, or neuter gods. 　In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. 　For example, Shaktism, the worship of the female force that animates the world, is one of the three major sects of Hinduism. 　Polytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honor multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. 　These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness>Consciousness</a> 

<font size=3>
Consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience and awareness of internal and external existence. 　However, the lack of definitions has led to millennia of analyses, explanations and debates by philosophers, theologians, linguists, and scientists. 　Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. 　In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind. 　In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition. 　Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling or perception. 　It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, or self-awareness either continuously changing or not. 　The disparate range of research, notions and speculations raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked. 　Examples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event or mental process of the brain.

<font size=3>
According to Abrahamic religions, Aaron (/ˈærən/ or /ˈɛərən/) was a prophet, a high priest, and the elder brother of Moses. 　Knowledge of Aaron, along with his brother Moses, exclusively comes from religious texts, such as the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. 　The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, who grew up in the Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). 　When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the enslavement of the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to the Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1). 　Part of the Law given to Moses at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. 　Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river. 　According to the Book of Numbers, he died and was buried on Mount Hor, Deuteronomy however places these events at Moserah. 　Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible (Luke, Acts, and Hebrews).

<font size=3>
Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. 　It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships. 　Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its everyday meaning. 　For example, a person with a mental disorder, a low mental age, or under the legal age of sexual consent may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law. 　United Nations agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a comprehensive sexuality education is beneficial. 　Types of consent include implied consent, express consent, informed consent and unanimous consent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum>Drum</a> 

<font size=3>
The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. 　In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. 　Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. 　There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. 　Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. 　Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. 　Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. 　Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. 　A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight>Midnight</a> 

<font size=3>
Midnight is the transition time from one day to the next – the moment when the date changes, on the local official clock time for any particular jurisdiction. 　By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours. 　Solar midnight is the time opposite to solar noon, when the Sun is closest to the nadir, and the night is equidistant from dusk and dawn. 　Due to the advent of time zones, which regularize time across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, solar midnight rarely coincides with 12 midnight on the clock. 　Solar midnight depends on longitude and time of the year rather than on time zone. 　In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between sunset and sunrise (i.e., solar midnight), varying according to the seasons. 　In some Slavic languages, "midnight" has an additional geographic association with "north" (as "noon" does with "south"). 　Modern Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Serbian languages preserve this association with their words for "midnight" or "half-night" (północ, поўнач, північ, пoнoħ) also meaning "north."

<font size=3>
A grain is a small, hard, dry fruit (caryopsis) – with or without an attached hull layer – harvested for human or animal consumption. 　A grain crop is a grain-producing plant. 　The two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes. 　After being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other staple foods, such as starchy fruits (plantains, breadfruit, etc.) and tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava, and more). 　This durability has made grains well suited to industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in silos, and milled for flour or pressed for oil. 　Thus, the grain market is a major global commodity market that includes crops such as maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other grains.

<font size=3>
A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as fossil conulariids. 　Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has deposited in concentric layers. 　The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur. 　The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. 　Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable. 　The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. 　These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. 　Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. 　Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry. 　Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry, but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. 　They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines and paint formulations. 　Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them. 　However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls (technically "calcareous concretions") of lesser shine or less spherical shape. 　Although these may also be legitimately referred to as "pearls" by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, most of them have no value except as curiosities.

<font size=3>
Slavery and enslavement are the experience of being a slave, who is someone forbidden to quit serving an enslaver, and is treated by the enslaver as property. 　Slavery typically involves some form of work, while the worker’s location or residence is dictated by the enslaver. 　Many historical cases of enslavement occurred as a result of breaking the law, becoming indebted, or suffering a military defeat; other forms of slavery were instituted along demographic lines such as race. 　Slaves may be kept in bondage for life, or for a fixed period of time after which they would be granted freedom. 　Although slavery is usually involuntary and involves coercion, there are also cases where people voluntarily enter into slavery to pay a debt or earn money due to poverty. 　In the course of human history, slavery was a typical feature of civilization, and was legal in most societies, but it is now outlawed in most countries of the world, except as a punishment for a crime. 　In chattel slavery, the slave is legally rendered the personal property (chattel) of the slave owner. 　In economics, the term de facto slavery describes the conditions of unfree labour and forced labour that most slaves endure. 　In 2019, approximately 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved throughout the world despite it being illegal. 　In the modern world, more than 50 percent of slaves provide forced labour, usually in the factories and sweatshops of the private sector of a country's economy. 　In industrialised countries, human trafficking is a modern variety of slavery; in non-industrialised countries, enslavement by debt bondage is a common form of enslaving a person, such as captive domestic servants, forced marriage, and child soldiers.

Sake, also spelled saké (sake (酒, Sake) /ˈsɑːki, ˈsækeɪ/ SAH-kee, SAK-ay; also referred to as Japanese rice wine), is an alcoholic beverage of Japanese origin made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. 　Despite the name Japanese rice wine, sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes. 　The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. 　Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. 　The alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3–9% ABV, wine generally contains 9–16% ABV, and undiluted sake contains 18–20% ABV (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water before bottling). 　In Japanese, the character sake (kanji: 酒, Japanese pronunciation: [sake]) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒; meaning 'Japanese alcoholic drink'). 　Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word seishu (清酒; 'refined alcohol'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation. 　In Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a sakazuki. 　As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type. 　Sake now enjoys an international reputation. 　Of the more than 800 junmai ginjō-shu evaluated by Robert Parker's team, 78 received a score of 90 or more (eRobertParker，2016).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham>Abraham</a> 

<font size=3>
Abraham (originally Abram) is the common Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 　In Judaism, he is the founding father of the special relationship between the Jews and God; in Christianity, he is the spiritual progenitor of all believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish; and in Islam, he is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam (see Adam in Islam) and culminates in Muhammad. 　The story of the life of Abraham as told in the narrative of the Book of Genesis, revolves around the themes of posterity and land. 　He is said to have been called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land of Canaan, which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. 　This promise is subsequently inherited by Isaac, Abraham's son by his wife Sarah, while Isaac's half-brother Ishmael is also promised that he will be the founder of a great nation. 　Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance. 　Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives "all Abraham's goods" while the other sons receive only "gifts". 　Most historians view the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus and the period of the biblical judges, as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era; and after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical Abraham. 　It is largely concluded that the Torah was composed during the early Persian period (late-6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their "father Abraham", and the returning exiles who based their counterclaim on Moses and the Exodus tradition of the Israelites.

<font size=3>
A skill is the learned ability to act with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. 　Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. 　For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job. 　Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used. 　A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in the art of medicine or the art of war. 　Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts. 　People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy. 　A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. 　Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual. 　The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

<font size=3>
A butler is a person who works in a house serving and is a domestic worker in a large household. 　In great houses, the household is sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry. 　Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor, and housekeepers caring for the entire house and its appearance. 　A butler is usually male, and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually a woman, and in charge of female servants. 　Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants. 　The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. 　He can also sometimes function as a chauffeur. 　In older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as majordomo, butler administrator, house manager, manservant, staff manager, chief of staff, staff captain, estate manager, and head of household staff are sometimes given. 　The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. 　In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. 　The butler can also be assisted by a head footman or footboy called the under-butler.

Printing is a process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or template. 　The earliest non-paper products involving printing include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus. 　The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was woodblock printing, which appeared in China before 220 AD for cloth printing. 　However, it would not be applied to paper until the seventh century. 　Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. 　The technology of printing played a key role in the development of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo>Anglo</a> 

<font size=3>
Anglo is a prefix indicating a relation to, or descent from, the Angles, England, English culture, the English people or the English language, such as in the term Anglosphere. 　It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of British descent in Anglo-America, the Anglophone Caribbean, South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand. 　It is used in Canada to differentiate between the French speakers (Francophone) of mainly Quebec and some parts of New Brunswick, and the English speakers (Anglophone) in the rest of Canada. 　It is also used in the United States to distinguish the Latino population from the non-Latino white majority. 　Anglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote English- in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. 　The word is derived from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, East Anglia. 　Anglia and England both mean land of the Angles, a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln, that is, the region of today's Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula. 　(There are various hypotheses for the origin of the name 'Angeln'.) 　It is also often used to refer to British in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707, for example such as in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government. 　Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being Anglo. 　Anglo is not an easily defined term. 　For traditionalists, there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own. 　For example, the purpose of the -o ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example Anglo-Saxon meaning of Angle and Saxon origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, Latino and Anglo. 　However, a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. 　The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified.

Muslims (Arabic: المسلمون, al-Muslimūn, transl. "Submitters [to God]") are people who adhere to Islam, a monotheistic religion belonging to the Abrahamic tradition. 　They consider the Quran, the foundational religious text of Islam, to be the verbatim word of the God of Abraham (or Allah) as it was revealed to Muhammad, the main Islamic prophet. 　The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith). 　With an estimated population of almost 1.9 billion followers as of 2020 year estimation, Muslims comprise more than 24.9% of the world's total population. 　In descending order, the percentage of people who identify as Muslims on each continental landmass stands at: 45% of Africa, 25% of Asia and Oceania (collectively), 6% of Europe, and 1% of the Americas. 　Additionally, in subdivided geographical regions, the figure stands at: 91% of the Middle East–North Africa, 90% of Central Asia, 65% of the Caucasus, 42% of Southeast Asia, 32% of South Asia, and 42% of sub-Saharan Africa. 　While there are several Islamic schools and branches, the two largest denominations are Sunni Islam (75–90% of all Muslims) and Shia Islam (10–20% of all Muslims). 　By sheer numbers, South Asia accounts for the largest portion (31%) of the global Muslim population, primarily across three countries: Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. 　By country, Indonesia is the largest in the Muslim world, holding around 12% of all Muslims worldwide; outside of the Muslim-majority countries, India and China are home to the largest (11%) and second-largest (2%) Muslim populations, respectively. 　Due to high Muslim population growth, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world.

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 　More precisely, an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, or n {\displaystyle n} -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space. 　One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not lemniscates. 　Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. 　Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane. 　The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. 　Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. 　The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans). 　Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. 　One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. 　A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. 　Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity. 　The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_(psychology)>Compensation (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In psychology, compensation is a strategy whereby one covers up, consciously or unconsciously, weaknesses, frustrations, desires, or feelings of inadequacy or incompetence in one life area through the gratification or (drive towards) excellence in another area. 　Compensation can cover up either real or imagined deficiencies and personal or physical inferiority. 　Positive compensations may help one to overcome one's difficulties. 　On the other hand, negative compensations do not, which results in a reinforced feeling of inferiority. 　There are two kinds of negative compensation: Overcompensation, characterized by a superiority goal, leads to striving for power, dominance, self-esteem, and self-devaluation. 　Undercompensation, which includes a demand for help, leads to a lack of courage and a fear for life. 　A well-known example of failing overcompensation is observed in people going through a midlife-crisis. 　Approaching midlife, many people lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.

Noah (/ˈnoʊ.ə/) is the tenth and last of the pre-Flood patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions. 　His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis, chapters 5–9), the Quran and Baha'i writings. 　Noah is referenced in various other books of the Bible, including the New Testament, and in associated deuterocanonical books. 　The Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. 　In this account, Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood, which God created after realising that the world was full of sin. 　Afterwards, God made a covenant with Noah and promised never again to destroy all the Earth's creatures with a flood. 　Noah is also portrayed as a "tiller of the soil" and as a drinker of wine. 　After the flood, God commands Noah and his sons to "be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth".

<font size=3>
A porch (from Old French porche, from Latin porticus "colonnade", from porta "passage") is a room or gallery located in front of an entrance of a building. 　A porch is placed in front of the facade of a building it commands, and forms a low front. 　Alternatively, it may be a vestibule, or a projecting building that houses the entrance door of a building. 　Porches exist in both religious and secular architecture. 　There are various styles of porches, many of which depend on the architectural tradition of its location. 　Porches allow for sufficient space for a person to comfortably pause before entering or after exiting a building, or to relax on. 　Many porches are open on the outward side with balustrade supported by balusters that usually encircles the entire porch except where stairs are found. 　The word "porch" is almost exclusively used for a structure that is outside the main walls of a building or house. 　Porches can exist under the same roof line as the rest of the building, or as towers and turrets that are supported by simple porch posts or ornate colonnades and arches. 　Examples of porches include those found in Queen Anne style architecture, Victorian style houses, Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, or any of the American Colonial style buildings and homes. 　Some porches are small and cover only the entrance area of a building. 　Other porches are larger, sometimes extending beyond an entrance by wrapping around the sides of a building, or even wrapping around completely to surround an entire building. 　A porch can be part of the ground floor or an upper floor, a design used in the Mrs. Lydia Johnson House (built in 1895).

<font size=3>
Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation producing computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. 　Headquartered at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. 　Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. 　Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2019. 　It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (Facebook). 　Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 　It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. 　The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. 　Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2  billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011. 　As of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. 　The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio). 　Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy. 　This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. 　Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999. 　Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. 　In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. 　As of 2022[update], Microsoft has the fourth-highest global brand valuation. 　Microsoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.

<font size=3>
In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as (1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus and; (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as wrist joints. 　This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, bracelet lines, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. 　As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini>Mini</a> 

<font size=3>
The Mini is a small, two-door, four-seat car, developed as ADO15, and produced by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors, from 1959 through 2000. 　Minus a brief hiatus, original Minis were built for four decades and sold during six, from the last year of the 1950s into the last year of the 20th century, over a single generation, as fastbacks, estates, and convertibles. 　The original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture. 　Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers. 　In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle. 　The front-wheel-drive, transverse-engine layout of the Mini was copied for other "supermini" designs including the Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat 127 (1971). 　The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs. 　This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. 　It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in England located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti) Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV). 　The Italian version of the Mini which was sold under the Innocenti marque was produced in Lambrate, a district of Milan. 　The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates: the Mark II, the Clubman, and the Mark III. 　Within these was a series of variations, including an estate car, a pick-up truck, a van, and the Mini Moke, a jeep-like buggy. 　The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper "S", were successful as both race and rally cars, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965, and 1967. 　In 1966, the first-placed Mini (along with nine other cars) was disqualified after the finish, under a controversial decision that the car's headlights were against the rules. 　On its introduction in August 1959, the Mini was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor. 　The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962 and Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969. 　In 1980, it once again became the Austin Mini, and in 1988, just "Mini" (although the "Rover" badge was applied on some models exported to Japan). 　BMW acquired the Rover Group (formerly British Leyland) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the Mini name. 　Retrospectively, the car is known as the "Classic Mini" to distinguish it from the modern, BMW influenced MINI family of vehicles produced since 2000.

<font size=3>
Shah (/ʃɑː/; Persian: شاه, Šâh [ʃɒːh], lit. 'king') is a royal title that was historically used by the leading figures of Iranian monarchies. 　It was also used by a variety of Persianate societies, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Kazakh Khanate, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, historical Afghan dynasties, and among Gurkhas. 　Rather than regarding himself as simply a king of the concurrent dynasty (i.e. European-style monarchies), each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah (شاهنشاه, Šâhanšâh, lit. 'King of Kings') or Padishah (پادشاه, Pâdešâh, lit. 'Master King') in the sense of a continuation of the original Persian Empire.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology>Theology</a> 

<font size=3>
Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine and, more broadly, of religious belief. 　It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. 　It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. 　Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and, in particular, to reveal themselves to humankind. 　While theology has turned into a secular field[according to whom?], religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship. 　Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. 　As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations. 　The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. 　Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. 　Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.

<font size=3>
A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. 　Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. 　Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account. 　Under the feudal system, a Knight's fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land. 　A contingent fee is an attorney's fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney. 　A service fee, service charge, or surcharge is a fee added to a customer's bill. 　The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided. 　Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers' compensation insurance fees, and planning fees. 　UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel. 　Restaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Montana), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them. 　A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff. 　A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis>Dennis</a> 

<font size=3>
Dennis or Denis is a first or last name from the Greco-Roman name Dionysius, via one of the Christian saints named Dionysius. 　The name came from Dionysus, the Greek god of ecstatic states, particularly those produced by wine, which is sometimes said to be derived from the Greek Dios (Διός, "of Zeus") and Nysos or Nysa (Νῦσα), where the young god was raised. 　Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. 　He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace—as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater. 　Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites, such as those practiced in honor of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis near Athens. 　In the Thracian mysteries, he wears the "bassaris" or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. 　(See also Maenads.) 　A mediaeval Latinised form of the Anglo-Norman surname Le Denys was Dacus, which correctly meant Dacian, but when the Vikings were about was often used to mean "Danish" or "The Dane". 　The name became modernised as Denys, then later as Dennis. 　Alternative forms and spellings of the name include Denis, Denys, Dennys, Denish, Deon, Deonne, Deonte, and Dion, Dionice. 　Diminutive forms include Den, Dennoh, Deno, Denny, Deny and Deen. 　The name Sydenie (alternate spellings: Sydney or Sidney) may derive from a village in Normandy called Saint-Denis.　[citation needed] A medieval diminutive was Dye, from which the names Dyson and Tyson are derived.　[citation needed] Dennis is a very popular English, Irish and Danish name, common throughout the English-speaking world, and a very popular French name, common throughout the Francophone world. 　It is also common as a German, Italian, Dutch, Croatian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Brazilian, Bosnian, and Albanian name. 　Dionizy is the Polish version of the name, while Dionigi and Dionisio are the Italian versions of the name. 　The Irish name Donnchadh may be anglicised as Denis, but has a different origin and is in fact related to the name Duncan. 　Feminine versions of the name include: Denise, Denisa, Deni, Denice, Deniece, Dione, and Dionne.

<font size=3>
In Norse paganism, Freyja (Old Norse "(the) Lady") is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and seiðr (magic for seeing and influencing the future). 　Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisvíni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. 　By her husband Óðr, she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. 　Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. 　Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja. 　Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. 　The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. 　Within Fólkvangr lies her hall, Sessrúmnir. 　Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. 　Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. 　She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. 　Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, Vanadís, and Valfreyja. 　Freyja is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story "Sörla þáttr"; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore. 　Scholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples. 　They have connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain, and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE "Isis" of the Suebi. 　In Scandinavia, Freyja's name frequently appears in the names of plants, especially in southern Sweden. 　Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. 　Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.

Adelaide (/ˈædɪleɪd/ (listen) AD-il-ayd; Kaurna: Tarntanya), is the capital city of South Australia, the state's largest city and the fifth-most populous city in Australia. 　"Adelaide" may refer to either Greater Adelaide (including the Adelaide Hills) or the Adelaide city centre. 　The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide. 　The Traditional Owners of the Adelaide region are the Kaurna people. 　The area of the city centre and surrounding parklands is called Tarndanya in the Kaurna language. 　Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. 　Its metropolitan area extends 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and stretches 96 km (60 mi) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south. 　Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. 　Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens. 　Light's design, now listed as national heritage, set out the city centre in a grid layout known as "Light's Vision", interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands. 　Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers, in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities. 　Until the post-war era, it was Australia's third most populated city. 　It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms, and became known as the "City of Churches" due to its diversity of faiths. 　Today, Adelaide is known by its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. 　Adelaide's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century, at one stage being named Australia's most liveable city. 　As South Australia's government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. 　Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of North Terrace and King William Street.

Virtue (Latin: virtus) is moral excellence. 　A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. 　In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards: doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. 　The opposite of virtue is vice. 　Other examples of this notion include the concept of merit in Asian traditions as well as De (Chinese 德). 　Buddhism's four brahmavihara ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.

<font size=3>
Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are vision eyewear with lenses (clear or tinted) mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms (known as temples or temple pieces) that rest over the ears. 　Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness; however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes. 　Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection on the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. 　Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. 　Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. 　Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. 　Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck to prevent the loss and breaking of the glasses. 　The loss of glasses would be detrimental to those working in these conditions. 　Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. 　Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; photochromic glasses are blacked out or lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when they come into contact with ultraviolet light. 　Most over-the-counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made. 　People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary symptom (like certain migraine disorders or Irlen syndrome) often wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even indoors and at night. 　Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example, 3D glasses for 3D films (stereoscopy). 　Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. 　Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials for frames.

<font size=3>
A calendar is a system of organizing days. 　This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. 　A date is the designation of a single and specific day within such a system. 　A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. 　A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. 　Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon. 　The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar, a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain synchronized with the solar year over the long term.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland>Mainland</a> 

<font size=3>
Mainland is defined as "relating to or forming the main part of a country or continent, not including the islands around it [regardless of status under territorial jurisdiction by an entity]." 　The term is often politically, economically and/or demographically more significant than politically associated remote territories, such as exclaves or oceanic islands situated outside the continental shelf. 　In geography, "mainland" can denote the continental (i.e. non-insular) part of any polity or the main island within an island nation. 　In geopolitics, "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like metropole as an antonym to overseas territories. 　In the sense of "heartland", mainland is the opposite of periphery. 　In some language a separate concept of "mainland" is missing and is replaced with a "continental portion". 　The term is relative: in Tasmania, continental Australia is the mainland, while to residents of Flinders Island, the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland", although the geological Australian continent includes all the former plus the island of New Guinea and all the smaller islands (e.g. the Torres Strait Islands) in between.

<font size=3>
The gmina (Polish: [ˈɡmʲina], plural gminy [ˈɡmʲinɨ]) is the principal unit of the administrative division of Poland, similar to a municipality. 　As of 1 January 2019[update], there were 2,477 gminas throughout the country, encompassing over 43,000 villages. 　940 gminas include cities and towns, with 302 among them constituting an independent urban gmina (Polish: gmina miejska) consisting solely of a standalone town or one of the 107 cities, the latter governed by a city mayor (prezydent miasta). 　The gmina has been the basic unit of territorial division in Poland since 1974, when it replaced the smaller gromada (cluster). 　Three or more gminas make up a higher level unit called powiat, except for those holding the status of a city with powiat rights. 　Each and every powiat has the seat in a city or town, in the latter case either an urban gmina or a part of an urban-rural one.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket>Rocket</a> 

<font size=3>
A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. 'bobbin/spool') is a vehicle that uses jet propulsion to accelerate without using the surrounding air. 　A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust expelled at high speed. 　Rocket engines work entirely from propellant carried within the vehicle; therefore a rocket can fly in the vacuum of space. 　Rockets work more efficiently in a vacuum and incur a loss of thrust due to the opposing pressure of the atmosphere. 　Multistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. 　Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations. 　To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, or gravity. 　Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China. 　Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age, including setting foot on the Moon. 　Rockets are now used for fireworks, missiles and other weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight, and space exploration. 　Chemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer. 　The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst (monopropellant), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact (hypergolic propellants), two liquids that must be ignited to react (like kerosene (RP1) and liquid oxygen, used in most liquid-propellant rockets), a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer (solid fuel), or solid fuel with liquid or gaseous oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). 　Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. 　However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope>Slope</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line. 　Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as "y = mx + b" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as "y = mx + c". 　Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line. 　Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient ("rise over run"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. 　A line that is decreasing has a negative "rise". 　The line may be practical – as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan. 　The steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. 　A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. 　The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. 　A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. 　The slope is positive, i.e. m > 0 {\displaystyle m>0} . 　A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. 　The slope is negative, i.e. m < 0 {\displaystyle m<0} . 　If a line is horizontal the slope is zero. 　This is a constant function. 　If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below). 　The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 − y1) = Δy. 　For relatively short distances, where the Earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 − x1) = Δx. 　Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line. 　In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is m = y 2 − y 1 x 2 − x 1 . 　{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.　} The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering. 　Through trigonometry, the slope m of a line is related to its angle of inclination θ by the tangent function m = tan ⁡ ( θ ) {\displaystyle m=\tan(\theta )} Thus, a 45° rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45° falling line has a slope of −1. 　As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point. 　When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. 　When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic expression, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve. 　This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors. 　Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment.

Athens (/ˈæθɪnz/ ATH-inz; Greek: Αθήνα, romanized: Athína [aˈθina] (listen); Ancient Greek: Ἀθῆναι, romanized: Athênai (pl.) [atʰɛ̂ːnai̯]) is a coastal city in the Mediterranean and is both the capital and largest city of Greece. 　With a population close to four million, it is also the seventh largest city in the European Union. 　Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. 　Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. 　It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. 　It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political influence on the European continent—particularly Ancient Rome. 　In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. 　In 2021, Athens' urban area hosted more than three and a half million people, which is around 35% of the entire population of Greece.　[citation needed] Athens is a Beta-status global city according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and is one of the biggest economic centers in Southeastern Europe. 　It also has a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe, and the third largest in the world. 　The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which actually constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire city, had a population of 637,798 (in 2021) within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi). 　The Athens Metropolitan Area or Greater Athens extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,722,544 (in 2021) over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi). 　Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland and the warmest major city in continental Europe with an average annual temperature of up to 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) locally. 　The heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments, and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. 　The city also retains Roman, Byzantine and a smaller number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. 　Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. 　Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament and the so-called "Architectural Trilogy of Athens", consisting of the National Library of Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and the Academy of Athens. 　Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art, the Benaki Museum, and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. 　Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics, making it one of the few cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once. 　Athens joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility>Utility</a> 

<font size=3>
As a topic of economics, utility is used to model worth or value. 　Its usage has evolved significantly over time. 　The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness as part of the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. 　The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a single consumer's preference ordering over a choice set but is not comparable across consumers. 　This concept of utility is personal and based on choice rather than on pleasure received, and so is specified more rigorously than the original concept but makes it less useful (and controversial) for ethical decisions.

An arch is a vertical curved structure that spans an elevated space and may or may not support the weight above it, or in case of a horizontal arch like an arch dam, the hydrostatic pressure against it. 　Arches may be synonymous with vaults, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. 　Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the ancient Romans, who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.

<font size=3>
An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. 　Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. 　The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period. 　The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. 　The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. 　At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. 　When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. 　Earthquakes can also trigger landslides. 　In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. 　Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. 　An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. 　The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia>Militia</a> 

<font size=3>
A militia (/mɪˈlɪʃə/) is generally an army or some other fighting organization of non-professional soldiers, citizens of a country, or subjects of a state, who may perform military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel; or, historically, to members of a warrior-nobility class (e.g. knights or samurai). 　Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces, militias commonly support regular troops by skirmishing, holding fortifications, or conducting irregular warfare, instead of undertaking offensive campaigns by themselves. 　Local civilian laws often limit militias to serve only in their home region, and to serve only for a limited time; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns. 　Beginning in the late 20th century, some militias (in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government) act as professional forces, while still being "part-time" or "on-call" organizations. 　For instance, the members of United States National Guard units are considered professional soldiers, as they are trained to the same standards as their "full-time" (active duty) counterparts are. 　Militias thus can be either military or paramilitary, depending on the instance. 　Some of the contexts in which the term "militia" can apply include: forces engaged in a defense activity or service, to protect a community, its territory, property, and laws, the entire able-bodied population of a community, town, county, or state available to be called to arms a subset of these who may be legally penalized for failing to respond to a call-up a subset of these who actually respond to a call-up regardless of legal obligation a private (non-governmental) force not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by a government an irregular armed force that enables its leader to exercise military, economic, or political control over a subnational territory within a sovereign state in Russia and some countries of the former Soviet Union, an official reserve army composed of citizen soldiers known as the militsiya or militia (police) a select militia composed of a small, non-representative portion of the population, maritime militias composed of fishermen and other participants of the marine industry which are organized and sanctioned by a state to enforce its maritime boundaries.

A stranger is a person who is unknown to another person or group. 　Because of this unknown status, a stranger may be perceived as a threat until their identity and character can be ascertained. 　Different classes of strangers have been identified for social science purposes, and the tendency for strangers and foreigners to overlap has been examined. 　The presence of a stranger can throw an established social order into question, "because the stranger is neither friend nor enemy; and because he may be both". 　The distrust of strangers has led to the concept of stranger danger (and the expression "don't talk to strangers"), wherein excessive emphasis is given to teaching children to fear strangers despite the most common sources of abduction or abuse being people known to the child.

<font size=3>
The playoffs, play-offs, postseason or finals of a sports league are a competition played after the regular season by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade. 　Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a tournament, and may use a single-elimination system or one of several other different playoff formats. 　Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament. 　In team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. 　Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league's best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. 　Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. 　Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams – the term "wild card" refers to these teams. 　In England and Scotland, playoffs are used in association football to decide promotion for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. 　In the EFL Championship (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the final promotion spot to the Premier League.

<font size=3>
Chess is a board game between two players. 　It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). 　The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. 　Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide. 　Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. 　It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 　At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. 　The player controlling the white pieces moves first, followed by the player controlling the black pieces. 　The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. 　There are also several ways a game can end in a draw. 　Organized chess arose in the 19th century. 　Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). 　The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. 　A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. 　Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology. 　One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. 　In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. 　Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory. 　This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.

The Renaissance (UK: /rɪˈneɪsəns/ rin-AY-sənss, US: /ˈrɛnəsɑːns/ (listen) REN-ə-sahnss) is a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries, characterized by an effort to revive and surpass ideas and achievements of classical antiquity. 　It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. 　In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a "long Renaissance" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century. 　The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages. 　However, the beginnings of the period – the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300 – overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c. 　1250–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; and as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either. 　The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "man is the measure of all things". 　This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science, and literature. 　Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. 　Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto. 　As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. 　In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. 　Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance man". 　The Renaissance began in Florence, one of the many states of Italy. 　Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. 　Other major centers were Venice, Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. 　From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe in Flanders, France, Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Poland, Hungary (with Beatrice of Naples), and elsewhere. 　The Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual cultural heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. 　Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, "by a thousand ties". 　The term rinascita ('rebirth') first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists (c. 1550), anglicized as the Renaissance in the 1830s. 　The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), Ottonian Renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the Renaissance of the 12th century.

<font size=3>
Sheep or domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. 　Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. 　Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. 　Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. 　An adult female is referred to as a ewe (/juː/), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb. 　Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia, with Iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center. 　One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. 　A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. 　In Commonwealth countries, ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones; in the United States, meat from both older and younger animals is usually called lamb. 　Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science. 　Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. 　In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production. 　There is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect. 　Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. 　A group of sheep is called a flock. 　Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age. 　Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. 　As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. 　Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. 　In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg>Egg</a> 

<font size=3>
An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell (a zygote) and to incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. 　Most arthropods such as insects, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not. 　Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. 　Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. 　When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell. 　Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering. 　The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm × 14 cm × 9 cm (11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in) in size. 　Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother. 　At 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) and up to 17.8 cm × 14 cm (7.0 in × 5.5 in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird,: 130  though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs. 　The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which measures between 6.35–11.4 millimetres (0.250–0.449 in) long and weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz).　: 132  Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller. 　Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed "spores," or in spermatophytes "seeds," or in gametophytes "egg cells".

<font size=3>
In topology, a branch of mathematics, the suspension of a topological space X is intuitively obtained by stretching X into a cylinder and then collapsing both end faces to points. 　One views X as "suspended" between these end points. 　The suspension of X is denoted by SX or susp(X).　: 76  There is a variation of the suspension for pointed space, which is called the reduced suspension and denoted by ΣX. 　The "usual" suspension SX is sometimes called the unreduced suspension, unbased suspension, or free suspension of X, to distinguish it from ΣX.

<font size=3>
Derby (/ˈdɑːrbi/ (listen) DAR-bee) is a city and unitary authority area in Derbyshire, England. 　It lies on the banks of the River Derwent in the south of Derbyshire, which is in the East Midlands Region. 　It was traditionally the county town of Derbyshire. 　Derby gained city status in 1977. 　The last decade has seen the population increase by 5.1%, from around 248,800 in 2011 to 261,400 in 2021. 　Derby was settled by Romans, who established the town of Derventio, later captured by the Anglo-Saxons, and later still by the Vikings, who made their town of Djúra-bý one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. 　Initially a market town, Derby grew rapidly in the industrial era. 　Home to Lombe's Mill, an early British factory, Derby has a claim to be one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution.　[citation needed] It contains the southern part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. 　With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Derby became a centre of the British rail industry. 　Derby is a centre for advanced transport manufacturing, being home to the world's second largest aero-engine manufacturer: Rolls-Royce. 　Bombardier Transportation has a production facility at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works while Toyota Manufacturing UK's automobile headquarters is located southwest of the city at Burnaston.

A parade is a procession of people, usually organized along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by marching bands, floats, or sometimes large balloons. 　Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually celebrations of some kind. 　In British English, the term "parade" is usually reserved for either military parades or other occasions where participants march in formation; for celebratory occasions, the word procession is more usual.　[citation needed] The term "parade" may also be used for multiple different subjects; for example, in the Canadian Armed Forces, "parade" is used both to describe the procession and in other informal connotations. 　Protest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but such cases are usually referred to as a march instead.

<font size=3>
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only than Mercury. 　In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. 　Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. 　Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. 　Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. 　Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest-known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. 　The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature. 　Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. 　Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth. 　Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. 　In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. 　It is not known whether life has ever existed on Mars. 　Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. 　NASA's Viking 1 lander transmitted the first images from the Martian surface in 1976. 　Two countries have successfully deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with Zhurong in 2021. 　There are also planned future missions to Mars, such as a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return set to happen in 2026, and the Rosalind Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch in 2018 but was delayed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely launch date at 2028. 　Mars can be viewed from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. 　This appearance, due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars often being called the Red Planet. 　It is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude that reaches −2.94, comparable to that of Jupiter and surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun. 　Mars has been observed since ancient times. 　Over the millennia has been featured in culture and the arts in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.

<font size=3>
In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars (Latin: Mārs, pronounced [maːrs]) was the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. 　He was the son of Jupiter and Juno, and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods. 　Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming. 　Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares, whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. 　The character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature. 　Mars's altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome; in Republican times it was a focus of electoral activities. 　Augustus shifted the focus of Mars' cult to within the pomerium (Rome's ritual boundary), and built a temple to Mars Ultor as a key religious feature of his new forum. 　Unlike Ares, who was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father (pater) of the Roman people. 　In Rome's mythic genealogy and founding, Mars fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia. 　His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, celebrated as the Trojan refugee who "founded" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar>Grammar</a> 

<font size=3>
In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words. 　The term can also refer to the study of such constraints, a field that includes domains such as phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. 　There are currently two different approaches to the study of grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar. 　Fluent speakers of a language variety or lect have effectively internalized these constraints, the vast majority of which – at least in the case of one's native language(s) – are acquired not by conscious study or instruction but by hearing other speakers. 　Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more explicit instruction. 　In this view, grammar is understood as the cognitive information underlying a specific instance of language production. 　The term "grammar" can also describe the linguistic behavior of groups of speakers and writers rather than individuals. 　Differences in scales are important to this sense of the word: for example, the term "English grammar" could refer to the whole of English grammar (that is, to the grammar of all the speakers of the language), in which case the term encompasses a great deal of variation. 　At a smaller scale, it may refer only to what is shared among the grammars of all or most English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). 　At the smallest scale, this sense of "grammar" can describe the conventions of just one relatively well-defined form of English (such as standard English for a region). 　A description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as grammar. 　A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a "reference grammar" or simply "a grammar" (see History of English grammars). 　A fully explicit grammar, which exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech variety, is called descriptive grammar. 　This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to actively discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions while codifying and promoting others, either in an absolute sense or about a standard variety. 　For example, some prescriptivists maintain that sentences in English should not end with prepositions, a prohibition that has been traced to John Dryden (13 April 1668 – January 1688) whose unexplained objection to the practice perhaps led other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use. 　Yet preposition stranding has a long history in Germanic languages like English, where it is so widespread as to be a standard usage. 　Outside linguistics, the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. 　It may be used more broadly to include conventions of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider as part of grammar but rather as part of orthography, the conventions used for writing a language. 　It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding those aspects of a language's grammar which are not subject to variation or debate on their normative acceptability. 　Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to."

A mosque (/mɒsk/ MOSK) or masjid (/ˈmæsdʒɪd, ˈmʌs-/ MASS-jid, MUSS-; both from Arabic: مَسْجِد, romanized: masjid, pronounced [ˈmasdʒid]; lit. 'place of ritual prostration') is a place of prayer for Muslims. 　Mosques are usually covered buildings, but can be any place where prayers (sujud) are performed, including outdoor courtyards. 　The first mosques were simple places of prayer for Muslims, and may have been open spaces rather than buildings. 　In the first stage of Islamic architecture, 650-750 CE, early mosques comprised open and closed covered spaces enclosed by walls, often with minarets from which calls to prayer were issued. 　Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche (mihrab) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca (qiblah) and ablution facilities. 　The pulpit (minbar), from which the Friday (jumu'ah) sermon (khutba) is delivered, was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques. 　Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women. 　This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period and denomination. 　Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer, Ramadan vigils, funeral services, marriage and business agreements, alms collection and distribution, as well as homeless shelters. 　Historically, mosques have served as a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. 　In modern times, they have also preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate. 　Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca (centre of the hajj), the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (burial place of Muhammad) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (believed to be the site of Muhammad's ascent to heaven). 　With the spread of Islam, mosques multiplied across the Islamic world. 　Sometimes churches and temples were converted into mosques, which influenced Islamic architectural styles. 　While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments, increasing government regulation of large mosques has been countered by a rise of privately funded mosques, many of which serve as bases for different Islamic revivalist currents and social activism. 　Mosques have played a number of political roles. 　The rates of mosque attendance vary widely depending on the region.

<font size=3>
Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on the interaction of events, facts, ideas, and people that are the "news of the day" and that informs society to at least some degree of accuracy. 　The word, a noun, applies to the occupation (professional or not), the methods of gathering information, and the organizing literary styles. 　The appropriate role for journalism varies from countries to country, as do perceptions of the profession, and the resulting status. 　In some nations, the news media are controlled by government and are not independent. 　In others, news media are independent of the government and operate as private industry. 　In addition, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech, freedom of the press as well as slander and libel cases. 　The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. 　This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers, magazines, or television news channels. 　News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. 　Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball>Volleyball</a> 

<font size=3>
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. 　Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. 　It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. 　Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. 　The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball. 　The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. 　The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. 　The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. 　Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. 　An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. 　The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. 　A few of the most common faults include: causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net; catching and throwing the ball; double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team; net foul: touching the net during play; foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a front row player is trying to keep the ball in play. 　The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body. 　A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, specialized player positions, and offensive and defensive structures.

<font size=3>
Nevada (/nəˈvædə/ nə-VAD-ə; Spanish: [neˈβaða]) is a state in the Western region of the United States. 　It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. 　Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 32nd-most populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the U.S. states. 　Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area, including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities. 　Nevada's capital is Carson City. 　Las Vegas is the largest city in the state. 　Nevada is officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. 　It is also known as the "Battle Born State" because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words "Battle Born" also appear on its state flag); Due to a presidency held by Abraham Lincoln the Union benefited immensely from the support of newly awarded statehood by the infusion of the monetary support of nearly $400 million in silver ore generated at the time by the Comstock Lode.　[citation needed] Known also as the "Sagebrush State", for the native plant of the same name; and as the "Sage-hen State". 　The name means "snowy" in Spanish, referring to Nevada's small overlap with the Sierra Nevada mountain range; however, the rest of Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid, much of it within the Great Basin. 　Areas south of the Great Basin are within the Mojave Desert, while Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge. 　About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the U.S. federal government, both civilian and military. 　American Indians of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabit what is now Nevada. 　The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. 　They called the region Nevada (snowy) because of the snow which covered the mountains in winter similar to the Sierra Nevada in Spain. 　The area formed part of Alta California's territory within the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which gained independence as Mexico in 1821. 　The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the Mexican–American War, and it was incorporated as part of Utah Territory in 1850. 　The discovery of silver at the Comstock Lode in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of Nevada Territory out of western Utah Territory in 1861. 　Nevada became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, as the second of two states added to the Union during the Civil War (the first being West Virginia). 　Nevada has a reputation for its libertarian laws. 　In 1940, with a population of just over 110,000 people, Nevada was by far the least-populated state, with less than half the population of the next least-populous state, Wyoming. 　However, legalized gambling and lenient marriage and divorce laws transformed Nevada into a major tourist destination in the 20th century. 　Nevada is the only U.S. state where prostitution is legal, though it is illegal in its most populated regions – Clark County (Las Vegas), Washoe County (Reno) and Carson City (which, as an independent city, is not within the boundaries of any county). 　The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. 　Nevada is the driest state, and over time, and influenced by climate change, droughts in Nevada have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Nevada's water security.

<font size=3>
A thesis (plural: theses), or dissertation (abbreviated diss.), is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings. 　In some contexts, the word thesis or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally applied to a doctorate. 　This is the typical arrangement in American English. 　In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, the reverse is true. 　The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations. 　The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration. 　The word dissertation can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. 　The term thesis is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.

<font size=3>
Munich (/ˈmjuːnɪk/ MEW-nik; German: München [ˈmʏnçn̩] (listen); Bavarian: Minga [ˈmɪŋ(ː)ɐ] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of the German state of Bavaria. 　With a population of 1,558,395 inhabitants as of 31 July 2020, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. 　The city's metropolitan region is home to 6 million people. 　Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a tributary of the Danube) north of the Bavarian Alps, Munich is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km2). 　Munich is the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna. 　The city was first mentioned in 1158. 　Catholic Munich strongly resisted the Reformation and was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. 　Once Bavaria was established as a sovereign kingdom in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. 　In 1918, during the German Revolution, the ruling house of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived socialist republic was declared. 　In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the NSDAP. 　After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their "Capital of the Movement". 　The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but has restored most of its traditional cityscape. 　After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of Wirtschaftswunder, or "economic miracle". 　The city hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics and was one of the host cities of the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. 　Today, Munich is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. 　Munich is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of real estate prices and rental costs. 　According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Munich is considered an alpha-world city, as of 2015[update]. 　It is one of the most prosperous and fastest growing cities in Germany. 　The city is home to more than 530,000 people of foreign background, making up 37.7% of its population. 　Munich's economy is based on high tech, automobiles, the service sector and creative industries, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering and electronics among many other sectors. 　It has one of the strongest economies of any German city and the lowest unemployment rate of all cities in Germany with more than 1 million inhabitants. 　Munich is also one of the most attractive business locations in Germany. 　The city houses many multinational companies, such as BMW, Siemens, MAN, Allianz and MunichRE. 　In addition, Munich is home to two research universities, a multitude of scientific institutions, and world-renowned technology and science museums like the Deutsches Museum and BMW Museum. 　Munich's numerous architectural and cultural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest Volksfest, attract considerable tourism.

A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. 　The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. 　A farmer might own the farm land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others. 　In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers (or farmhands). 　However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention. 　Over half a billion farmers are smallholders, most of whom are in developing countries, and who economically support almost two billion people. 　Globally, women constitute more than 40% of agricultural employees.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless>Wireless</a> 

<font size=3>
Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information (telecommunication) between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer. 　The most common wireless technologies use radio waves. 　With radio waves, intended distances can be short, such as a few meters for Bluetooth or as far as millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications. 　It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way radios, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. 　Other examples of applications of radio wireless technology include GPS units, garage door openers, wireless computer mouse, keyboards and headsets, headphones, radio receivers, satellite television, broadcast television and cordless telephones. 　Somewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications involve other electromagnetic phenomena, such as light and magnetic or electric fields, or the use of sound. 　The term wireless has been used twice in communications history, with slightly different meanings. 　It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology, as in wireless telegraphy, until the new word radio replaced it around 1920. 　Radio sets in the UK and the English-speaking world that were not portable continued to be referred to as wireless sets into the 1960s. 　The term wireless was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires, such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph, from those that require wires or cables. 　This became its primary usage in the 2000s, due to the advent of technologies such as mobile broadband, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. 　Wireless operations permit services, such as mobile and interplanetary communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. 　The term is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls, etc.) that use some form of energy (e.g. radio waves and acoustic energy) to transfer information without the use of wires. 　Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.

<font size=3>
A presidency is an administration or the executive, the collective administrative and governmental entity that exists around an office of president of a state or nation. 　Although often the executive branch of government, and often personified by a single elected person who holds the office of "president", in practice, the presidency includes a much larger collective of people, such as chiefs of staff, advisers and other bureaucrats. 　Although often led by a single person, presidencies can also be of a collective nature, such as the presidency of the European Union is held on a rotating basis by the various national governments of the member states. 　Alternatively, the term presidency can also be applied to the governing authority of some churches, and may even refer to the holder of a non-governmental office of president in a corporation, business, charity, university, etc. or the institutional arrangement around them. 　For example, "the presidency of the Red Cross refused to support his idea." 　Rules and support to discourage vicarious liability leading to unnecessary pressure and the early termination of term have not been clarified. 　These may not be as yet supported by state let initiatives. 　Contributory liability and fraud may be the two most common ways to become removed from term of office and/or to prevent re-election.

In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. 　These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole, and probation. 　A typical correctional institution is a prison. 　A correctional system, also known as a penal system, thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons, and community-based programs like parole, and probation boards. 　This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. 　Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies. 　"Corrections" is also the name of a field of academic study concerned with the theories, policies, and programs pertaining to the practice of corrections. 　Its object of study includes personnel training and management as well as the experiences of those on the other side of the fence — the unwilling subjects of the correctional process. 　Stohr and colleagues (2008) write that "Earlier scholars were more honest, calling what we now call corrections by the name penology, which means the study of punishment for crime."

<font size=3>
Migration, in ecology, is the large-scale movement of members of a species to a different environment. 　Migration is a natural behavior and component of the life cycle of many species of mobile organisms, not limited to animals, though animal migration is the best known type. 　Migration is often cyclical, frequently occurring on a seasonal basis, and in some cases on a daily basis. 　Species migrate to take advantage of more favorable conditions with respect to food availability, safety from predation, mating opportunity, or other environmental factors. 　Migration is most commonly seen as animal migration, the physical movement by animals from one area to another. 　That includes bird, fish, and insect migration. 　However, plants can be said to migrate, as seed dispersal enables plants to grow in new areas, under environmental constraints such as temperature and rainfall, resulting in changes such as forest migration.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter>Helicopter</a> 

<font size=3>
A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors. 　This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. 　These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of STOL (Short TakeOff and Landing) or STOVL (Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing) aircraft cannot perform without a runway. 　In 1942, the Sikorsky R-4 became the first helicopter to reach full-scale production. 　Although most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, the configuration of a single main rotor accompanied by a vertical anti-torque tail rotor (i.e. unicopter, not to be confused with the single-blade monocopter) has become the most common helicopter configuration. 　However, twin-main rotor helicopters (bicopters), in either tandem or transverse rotors configurations, are sometimes in use due to their greater payload capacity than the monorotor design, and coaxial-rotor, tiltrotor and compound helicopters are also all flying today. 　Quadrotor helicopters (quadcopters) were pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and along with other types of multicopters, have been developed mainly for specialized applications such as drones.

<font size=3>
Coaching is a form of development in which an experienced person, called a coach, supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance. 　The learner is sometimes called a coachee. 　Occasionally, coaching may mean an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the latter learns; but coaching differs from mentoring by focusing on specific tasks or objectives, as opposed to more general goals or overall development.

<font size=3>
A sink is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes. 　Sinks have a tap (faucet) that supply hot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster rinsing. 　They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device. 　Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser. 　Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter. 　When a sink becomes clogged, a person will often resort to using a chemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the clog with a drain auger (often called a "plumber's snake").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation>Calculation</a> 

<font size=3>
A calculation is a deliberate mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or results. 　The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people. 　For example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. 　Extracting the square root or the cube root of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation. 　Statistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers. 　To calculate means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using logic, reason or common sense. 　The English word derives from the Latin calculus, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin calx). 　It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin abacus, Greek abax). 　The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the slide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars. 　Calculation is a prerequisite for computation.　[citation needed]

A fist is the shape of a hand when the fingers are bent inward against the palm and held there tightly. 　To make or clench a fist is to fold the fingers tightly into the center of the palm and then to clamp the thumb over the middle phalanges; in contrast to this "closed" fist, one keeps the fist "open" by holding the thumb against the side of the index finger. 　One uses the closed fist to punch the lower phalanges against a surface, or to pound with the little-finger side of the hand's heel; one uses the open fist to knock with the middle knuckle of the middle finger.

<font size=3>
Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 　Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. 　However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 　Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation. 　The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 　A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. 　Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. 　In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. 　It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. 　Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 　It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. 　Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. 　Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes. 　The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G and Toei Animation. 　Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. 　As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.

<font size=3>
Venice Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/ VEH-niss; Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] (listen); Venetian: Venesia or Venexia[citation needed] [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. 　It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. 　The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). 　In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). 　Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million. 　The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. 　The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. 　It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. 　The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. 　This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. 　For centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. 　The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. 　Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy. 　Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of Masks", "City of Bridges", "The Floating City", and "City of Canals". 　The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. 　Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi. 　Although the city is facing some challenges (including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings), Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. 　It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as "undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man".
