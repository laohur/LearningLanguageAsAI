<font size=3>
In marine and freshwater ecology, a particle is a small object. 　Particles can remain in suspension in the ocean or freshwater. 　However, they eventually settle (rate determined by Stokes' law) and accumulate as sediment. 　Some can enter the atmosphere through wave action where they can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). 　Many organisms filter particles out of the water with unique filtration mechanisms (filter feeders). 　Particles are often associated with high loads of toxins which attach to the surface. 　As these toxins are passed up the food chain they accumulate in fatty tissue and become increasingly concentrated in predators (see bioaccumulation). 　Very little is known about the dynamics of particles, especially when they are re-suspended by dredging. 　They can remain floating in the water and drift over long distances. 　The decomposition of some particles by bacteria consumes much oxygen and can cause the water to become hypoxic.

<font size=3>
In the physical sciences, a particle (or corpuscule in older texts) is a small localized object which can be described by several physical or chemical properties, such as volume, density, or mass. 　They vary greatly in size or quantity, from subatomic particles like the electron, to microscopic particles like atoms and molecules, to macroscopic particles like powders and other granular materials. 　Particles can also be used to create scientific models of even larger objects depending on their density, such as humans moving in a crowd or celestial bodies in motion. 　The term particle is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields. 　Anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate. 　However, the noun particulate is most frequently used to refer to pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere, which are a suspension of unconnected particles, rather than a connected particle aggregation.

<font size=3>
An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called "readers"), theatre, music (in which they are called "listeners"), video games (in which they are called "players"), or academics in any medium. 　Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art. 　Some events invite overt audience participation and others allow only modest clapping and criticism and reception. 　Media audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. 　Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. 　These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. 　The biggest art form is the mass media. 　Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations. 　In the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. 　American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, "Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don't give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will." 　Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, "The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be — what application, what device, what time, what place."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire>Desire</a> 
<font size=3>
Desires are states of mind that are expressed by terms like "wanting", "wishing", "longing" or "craving". 　A great variety of features is commonly associated with desires. 　They are seen as propositional attitudes towards conceivable states of affairs. 　They aim to change the world by representing how the world should be, unlike beliefs, which aim to represent how the world actually is. 　Desires are closely related to agency: they motivate the agent to realize them. 　For this to be possible, a desire has to be combined with a belief about which action would realize it. 　Desires present their objects in a favorable light, as something that appears to be good. 　Their fulfillment is normally experienced as pleasurable in contrast to the negative experience of failing to do so. 　Conscious desires are usually accompanied by some form of emotional response. 　While many researchers roughly agree on these general features, there is significant disagreement about how to define desires, i.e. which of these features are essential and which ones are merely accidental. 　Action-based theories define desires as structures that incline us toward actions. 　Pleasure-based theories focus on the tendency of desires to cause pleasure when fulfilled. 　Value-based theories identify desires with attitudes toward values, like judging or having an appearance that something is good. 　Desires can be grouped into various types according to a few basic distinctions. 　Intrinsic desires concern what the subject wants for its own sake while instrumental desires are about what the subject wants for the sake of something else. 　Occurrent desires are either conscious or otherwise causally active, in contrast to standing desires, which exist somewhere in the back of one's mind. 　Propositional desires are directed at possible states of affairs while object-desires are directly about objects. 　Various authors distinguish between higher desires associated with spiritual or religious goals and lower desires, which are concerned with bodily or sensory pleasures. 　Desires play a role in many different fields. 　There is disagreement whether desires should be understood as practical reasons or whether we can have practical reasons without having a desire to follow them. 　According to fitting-attitude theories of value, an object is valuable if it is fitting to desire this object or if we ought to desire it. 　Desire-satisfaction theories of well-being state that a person's well-being is determined by whether that person's desires are satisfied. 　Marketing and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service. 　Techniques include creating a sense of lack in the viewer or associating the product with desirable attributes. 　Desire plays a key role in art. 　The theme of desire is at the core of romance novels, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions, class, or cultural barriers. 　Melodrama films use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition>Exhibition</a> 
<font size=3>
An exhibition, in the most general sense, is an organized presentation and display of a selection of items. 　In practice, exhibitions usually occur within a cultural or educational setting such as a museum, art gallery, park, library, exhibition hall, or World's fairs. 　Exhibitions can include many things such as art in both major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive exhibitions, natural history museums and history museums, and also varieties such as more commercially focused exhibitions and trade fairs. 　In British English the word "exhibition" is used for a collection of items placed on display and the event as a whole, which in American English is usually an "exhibit". 　In both varieties of English each object being shown within an exhibition is an "exhibit". 　In common usage, "exhibitions" are considered temporary and usually scheduled to open and close on specific dates. 　While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations and are called travelling exhibitions, and some are online exhibitions. 　Exhibitions featuring especially fragile or valuable objects, or live animals—may be shown only during a formal presentation, under the close supervision of attendant or educator. 　Temporary exhibits that are transported from institution to institution are traveling exhibits. 　Though exhibitions are common events, the concept of an exhibition is quite wide and encompasses many variables. 　Exhibitions range from an extraordinarily large event such as a World's fair exposition to small one-artist solo shows or a display of just one item. 　Often a team of specialists is required to assemble and execute an exhibition; these specialists vary depending on the type of said exhibit. 　Curators are sometimes involved as the people who select the items in an exhibition. 　Writers and editors are sometimes needed to write text, labels and accompanying printed material such as catalogs and books. 　Architects, exhibition designers, graphic designers and other designers may be needed to shape the exhibition space and give form to the editorial content. 　Organizing and holding exhibitions also requires effective event planning, management, and logistics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra>Orchestra</a> 
<font size=3>
An orchestra (/ˈɔːrkɪstrə/; Italian: [orˈkɛstra]) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which combines instruments from different families. 　There are typically four main sections of instruments: bowed string instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass woodwinds, such as the flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon Brass instruments, such as the horn, trumpet, trombone, cornet, and tuba percussion instruments, such as the timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and mallet percussion instruments Other instruments such as the piano, harpsichord, and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone as soloist instruments, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments and guitars. 　A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra (from Greek phil-, "loving", and "harmony"). 　The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. 　A chamber orchestra (sometimes concert orchestra) is a smaller ensemble of not more than about fifty musicians. 　Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire such as the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. 　The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler. 　Orchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a conductor's baton. 　The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes the sound of the ensemble. 　The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed. 　The leader of the first violin section – commonly called the concertmaster – also plays an important role in leading the musicians. 　In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster, or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue. 　Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets, and some types of musical theatre (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas). 　Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region. 　The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα (orchestra), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell>Bell</a> 
<font size=3>
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument. 　Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator. 　The strike may be made by an internal "clapper" or "uvula", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell). 　Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials. 　This depends on the function. 　Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal. 　Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower. 　Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters. 　Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services. 　Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom. 　The study of bells is called campanology.

A roof (PL: roofs or rooves) is the top covering of a building, including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind. 　A roof is part of the building envelope. 　The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice, and may also be governed by local or national legislation. 　In most countries, a roof protects primarily against rain. 　A verandah may be roofed with material that protects against sunlight but admits the other elements. 　The roof of a garden conservatory protects plants from cold, wind, and rain, but admits light. 　A roof may also provide additional living space, for example, a roof garden.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon>Moon</a> 
<font size=3>
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 　It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). 　The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. 　It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. 　Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density. 　The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. 　Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. 　The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. 　During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. 　The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. 　However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration. 　The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. 　It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. 　The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. 　Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. 　The lunar surface is fairly non-reflective, with the reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that of asphalt. 　However, due to its large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. 　The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. 　Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history. 　Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. 　The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. 　The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. 　These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history. 　As of 2023, the Moon is the only other celestial body visited by humans, other than the Earth.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron>Electron</a> 
<font size=3>
The electron ( e− or β− ) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge. 　Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. 　The electron's mass is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. 　Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. 　Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. 　Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: They can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. 　The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy. 　Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. 　Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field. 　Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. 　Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. 　Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. 　Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. 　Electrons are involved in many applications such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, electronics, welding, cathode-ray tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators. 　Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. 　The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. 　Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. 　The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. 　In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. 　Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the cathode-ray tube experiment. 　Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. 　Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. 　The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical charge of the opposite sign. 　When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be annihilated, producing gamma ray photons.

<font size=3>
An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. 　In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources. 　A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. 　These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. 　In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone. 　Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. 　Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. 　However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. 　Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. 　It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition>Tradition</a> 
<font size=3>
A tradition is a belief or behavior (folk custom) passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. 　A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. 　Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word tradition itself derives from the Latin tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. 　While it is commonly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. 　Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. 　The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. 　Tradition is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. 　For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." 　This tradition may never be proven or disproven. 　In another example, "King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories." 　Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.　[citation needed] Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in social sciences such as folklore studies, anthropology, archaeology, and biology. 　The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. 　For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. 　In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. 　For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. 　A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. 　In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. 　Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying individuals, events, or places that are imaginary, or in ways that are imaginary. 　Fictional portrayals are thus inconsistent with history, fact, or plausibility. 　In a traditional narrow sense, "fiction" refers to written narratives in prose – often referring specifically to novels, novellas, and short stories. 　More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games.
