## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep>Keep</a> 
<font size=3>
A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. 　Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. 　The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England, south Italy and Sicily. 　As a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, use spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. 　The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. 　Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build. 　During the 12th century, new designs began to be introduced – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. 　By the end of the century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. 　In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. 　In the second half of the 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. 　In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. 　Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period. 　In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery. 　For example, in 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, the keep of Bamburgh Castle on the Northumberland coast, previously considered to be impregnable, was defeated with bombards. 　By the 16th century, keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences. 　Many were destroyed in civil wars between the 17th and 18th centuries or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies. 　During the 19th century, keeps became fashionable once again and in England and France, a number were restored or redesigned by Gothic architects. 　Despite further damage to many French and Spanish keeps during the wars of the 20th century, keeps now form an important part of the tourist and heritage industry in Europe.

<font size=3>
Looking is the act of intentionally focusing visual perception on someone or something, for the purpose of obtaining information, and possibly to convey interest or another sentiment. 　A large number of troponyms exist to describe variations of looking at things, with prominent examples including the verbs "stare, gaze, gape, gawp, gawk, goggle, glare, glimpse, glance, peek, peep, peer, squint, leer, gloat, and ogle". 　Additional terms with nuanced meanings include viewing, watching, eyeing, observing, beholding, and scanning. 　Looking is both a physical act of directing the focus of the eyes, and a psychological act of interpreting what is seen and choosing whether to continue looking at it, or to look elsewhere. 　Where more than one person is involved, looking may lead to eye contact between those doing the looking, which raises further implications for the relationship established through that act.

Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". 　A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. 　Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. 　Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. 　Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.

Health is an attribute in a video game or tabletop game that determines the maximum amount of damage or loss of stamina that a character or object can take before dying or losing consciousness. 　In role-playing games, this typically takes the form of hit points (HP), a numerical attribute representing the health of a character or object. 　The game character can be a player character, a boss, or a mob. 　Health can also be attributed to destructible elements of the game environment or inanimate objects such as vehicles and their individual parts. 　In video games, health is often represented by visual elements such as a numerical fraction, a health bar or a series of small icons, though it may also be represented acoustically, such as through a character's heartbeat.

<font size=3>
A person (PL: people) is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. 　The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts. 　In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. 　The plural form "people" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in "a people"), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. 　The plural form "persons" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.

<font size=3>
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time. 　The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. 　The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. 　In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language. 　The first known use of the word "past" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning "to pass."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star>Star</a> 
<font size=3>
A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. 　The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. 　Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. 　The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. 　Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. 　The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars. 　Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye, all within the Milky Way galaxy. 　A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. 　Its total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and eventual fate. 　A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. 　This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. 　At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a black hole. 　Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. 　Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. 　These elements are then recycled into new stars. 　Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time. 　Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. 　When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. 　Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science>Science</a> 
<font size=3>
Science is a systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. 　Systematic reasoning is tens of thousands of years old. 　The earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to modern science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. 　Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.　: 12  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance. 　The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. 　The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape, along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science". 　Modern science is typically divided into three major branches: natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules. 　There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines, because they do not rely on empirical evidence. 　Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medicine. 　New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. 　Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. 　The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the ethical and moral development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

A fact is a datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance, which, if accepted as true and proven true, allows a logical conclusion to be reached on a true–false evaluation. 　Standard reference works are often used to check facts. 　Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means. 　For example, "This sentence contains words." accurately describes a linguistic fact, and "The sun is a star" accurately describes an astronomical fact. 　Further, "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States" and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" both accurately describe historical facts. 　Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion. 　Facts are different from theories, values, and objects.
