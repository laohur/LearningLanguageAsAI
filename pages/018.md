## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist>Artist</a> 
<font size=3>
An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. 　The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. 　However, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors). 　"Artiste" (French for artist) is a variant used in English in this context, but this use has become rare. 　Use of the term "artist" to describe writers is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like used in criticism.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun>Sun</a> 
<font size=3>
The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 　It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. 　The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 　The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. 　Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 　Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. 　The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). 　As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). 　It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. 　Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. 　The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. 　It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. 　Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. 　This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. 　When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. 　It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. 　After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion. 　The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. 　The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. 　The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars. 　The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain>Mountain</a> 
<font size=3>
A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. 　Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. 　A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges. 　Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. 　Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. 　High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. 　These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. 　Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. 　The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. 　The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).

<font size=3>
Cold is the presence of low temperature, especially in the atmosphere. 　In common usage, cold is often a subjective perception. 　A lower bound to temperature is absolute zero, defined as 0.00 K on the Kelvin scale, an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. 　This corresponds to −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale, and 0.00 °R on the Rankine scale. 　Since temperature relates to the thermal energy held by an object or a sample of matter, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the particle constituents of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is colder and more when it is hotter. 　If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and they would be at complete rest in the classical sense. 　The object could be described as having zero thermal energy. 　Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.

In archaeological excavation, a feature is a collection of one or more contexts representing some human non-portable activity, such as a hearth or wall. 　Features serve as an indication that the area in which they are found has been interfered with in the past, usually by humans. 　Features are distinguished from artifacts in that they cannot be separated from their location without changing their form. 　Artifacts are portable, while features are non-portable. 　Artifacts and features can both be made from any available material, with the primary distinction being portability. 　Features and artifacts differ from ecofacts. 　Ecofacts are natural remains, such as plants and animals.

An author is the writer of a book, article, play, or other written work. 　A broader definition of the word "author" states: "An author is 'the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.　'" Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work, i.e. the author. If more than one person created the work (i.e., multiple authors), then a case of joint authorship takes place. Copyright laws differ around the world. The United States Copyright Office, for example, defines copyright as "a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of 'original works of authorship.　'"

<font size=3>
Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter – the others being solid, liquid, and plasma. 　A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). 　A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. 　What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. 　This separation usually makes a colourless gas invisible to the human observer. 　The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. 　Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. 　High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases. 　For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.

Temperature is a physical quantity that expresses quantitatively the perceptions of hotness and coldness. 　Temperature is measured with a thermometer. 　Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have relied on various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. 　The most common scales are the Celsius scale with the unit symbol °C (formerly called centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale (K), the latter being used predominantly for scientific purposes. 　The kelvin is one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI). 　Absolute zero, i.e., zero kelvin or −273.15 °C, is the lowest point in the thermodynamic temperature scale. 　Experimentally, it can be approached very closely but not actually reached, as recognized in the third law of thermodynamics. 　It would be impossible to extract energy as heat from a body at that temperature. 　Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material science, metallurgy, mechanical engineering and geography as well as most aspects of daily life.

<font size=3>
Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) is an umbrella term which encompasses the collective social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, which includes the collective knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. 　Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location. 　Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. 　A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group. 　Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change. 　Thus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. 　In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group. 　Cultural formation and change is the formation and reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. 　Cultures are formed or affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. 　Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies. 　Organizations like UNESCO attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of performing art that uses live performers, usually actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. 　The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. 　Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. 　The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe"). 　Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. 　Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general. 　A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances, as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a group of theatrical performers working together. 　Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. 　The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. 　They were influential to the development of musical theatre.

Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi), making it the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2020. 　Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. 　For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light". 　Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world. 　The City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an estimated population of 12,262,544 in 2019, or about 19% of the population of France, making the region France's primate city. 　The Paris Region had a GDP of €739 billion ($743 billion) in 2019, which is the highest in Europe. 　According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world. 　Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport. 　Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. 　Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015. 　Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 2.8 million visitors in 2021, despite the long museum closings caused by the COVID-19 virus. 　The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. 　The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso. 　The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. 　Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur. 　Paris hosts several United Nations organisations including UNESCO, and other international organisations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority. 　The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. 　The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. 　Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. 　The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. 　The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. 　Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.

<font size=3>
Paris (Ancient Greek: Πάρις), also known as Alexander (Ἀλέξανδρος, Aléxandros), the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, is a mythological nobleman that appears in a number of Greek legends. 　Of these appearances, probably the best known was the elopement with Helen, queen of Sparta, this being one of the immediate causes of the Trojan War. 　Later in the war, he fatally wounds Achilles in the heel with an arrow as foretold by Achilles's mother, Thetis. 　The name Paris is probably of Luwian origin, and comparable to Pari-zitis, attested as a Hittite scribe's name. 　The name Paris is etymologically unrelated to the name of the French city of Paris, which derives its name from a Gaulish tribe called the Parisii.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice>Justice</a> 
<font size=3>
Justice, in its broadest sense, is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, with the interpretation of what then constitutes "deserving" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness. 　The state will sometimes endeavor to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings. 　Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. 　Advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from God. 　In the 17th century, philosophers such as John Locke said that justice derives from natural law. 　Social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone. 　In the 19th century, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. 　Theories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. 　Egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. 　John Rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. 　Robert Nozick and others said that property rights, also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law, maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. 　Theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to ensure justice. 　The closely related restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.

Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. 　Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). 　By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants") which is sister of the Glaucophyta, and consists of the green algae and Embryophyta (land plants). 　The latter includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, and mosses. 　Most plants are multicellular organisms. 　Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. 　Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. 　Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. 　Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, however asexual reproduction is also common. 　There are about 320,000 known species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260,000–290,000, produce seeds. 　Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. 　Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. 　Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. 　The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(topology)>Cover (topology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover (or covering) of a set X {\displaystyle X} is a family of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} whose union is all of X {\displaystyle X} . 　More formally, if C = { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle C=\lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is an indexed family of subsets U α ⊂ X {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }\subset X} (indexed by the set A {\displaystyle A} ), then C {\displaystyle C} is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if ⋃ α ∈ A U α = X {\displaystyle \bigcup _{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha }=X} . 　Thus the collection { U α : α ∈ A } {\displaystyle \lbrace U_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\rbrace } is a cover of X {\displaystyle X} if each element of X {\displaystyle X} belongs to at least one of the subsets U α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} . 　A subcover of a cover of a set is a subset of the cover that also covers the set. 　A cover is called an open cover if each of its element is an open set.
