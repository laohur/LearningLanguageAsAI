<font size=3>
In language, a clause is a constituent that comprises a semantic predicand (expressed or not) and a semantic predicate. 　A typical clause consists of a subject and a syntactic predicate, the latter typically a verb phrase composed of a verb with any objects and other modifiers. 　However, the subject is sometimes unvoiced if it is retrievable from context, especially in null-subject language but also in other languages, including English instances of the imperative mood. 　A complete simple sentence includes a single clause with a finite verb. 　Complex sentences contain multiple clauses including at least one independent clause (meaning, a clause that can stand alone as a simple sentence) coordinated either with at least one dependent clause (also called an embedded clause) or with one or more independent clauses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch>Ranch</a> 
<font size=3>
A ranch (from Spanish: rancho) is an area of land, including various structures, given primarily to ranching, the practice of raising grazing livestock such as cattle and sheep. 　It is a subtype of a farm. 　These terms are most often applied to livestock-raising operations in Mexico, the Western United States and Western Canada, though there are ranches in other areas. 　People who own or operate a ranch are called ranchers, cattlemen, or stockgrowers. 　Ranching is also a method used to raise less common livestock such as horses, elk, American bison, ostrich, emu, and alpaca. 　Ranches generally consist of large areas, but may be of nearly any size. 　In the western United States, many ranches are a combination of privately owned land supplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal Bureau of Land Management or the United States Forest Service. 　If the ranch includes arable or irrigated land, the ranch may also engage in a limited amount of farming, raising crops for feeding the animals, such as hay and feed grains. 　Ranches that cater exclusively to tourists are called guest ranches or, colloquially, "dude ranches". 　Most working ranches do not cater to guests, though they may allow private hunters or outfitters onto their property to hunt native wildlife. 　However, in recent years,[when?] a few struggling smaller operations have added some dude ranch features such as horseback rides, cattle drives, and guided hunting to bring in additional income. 　Ranching is part of the iconography of the "Wild West" as seen in Western movies and rodeos.

<font size=3>
Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. 　Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. 　Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. 　As of July 2022, Facebook claimed 2.93 billion monthly active users, and ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites as of July 2022. 　It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s. 　Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. 　After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. 　They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. 　Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow. 　The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance. 　Posts originating from the Facebook page of Breitbart News, a media organization previously affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, are currently among the most widely shared political content on Facebook. 　Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech. 　Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.

<font size=3>
An anchor is a device, normally made of metal[citation needed], used to secure a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current. 　The word derives from Latin ancoracode: lat promoted to code: la , which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυραcode: ell promoted to code: el (ankȳracode: ell promoted to code: el ). 　Anchors can either be temporary or permanent. 　Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them. 　Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights. 　A sea anchor is a drag device, not in contact with the seabed, used to minimise drift of a vessel relative to the water. 　A drogue is a drag device used to slow or help steer a vessel running before a storm in a following or overtaking sea, or when crossing a bar in a breaking sea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman>Gentleman</a> 
<font size=3>
A gentleman (Old French: gentilz hom, gentle + man) is any man of good and courteous conduct. 　Originally, gentleman was the lowest rank of the landed gentry of England, ranking below an esquire and above a yeoman; by definition, the rank of gentleman comprised the younger sons of the younger sons of peers, and the younger sons of a baronet, a knight, and an esquire, in perpetual succession. 　As such, the connotation of the term gentleman captures the common denominator of gentility (and often a coat of arms); a right shared by the peerage and the gentry, the constituent classes of the British nobility. 　Therefore, the English social category of gentleman corresponds to the French gentilhomme (nobleman), which in Great Britain meant a member of the peerage of England. 　In that context, the historian Maurice Keen said that the social category of gentleman is "the nearest, contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France." 　In the 14th century, the term gentlemen comprised the hereditary ruling class, which is whom the rebels of the Peasants' Revolt (1381) meant when they repeated: When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman? 　In the 17th century, in Titles of Honour (1614), the jurist John Selden said that the title gentleman likewise speaks of "our English use of it" as convertible with nobilis (nobility by rank or personal quality) and describes the forms of a man's elevation to the nobility in European monarchies. 　In the 19th century, James Henry Lawrence explained and discussed the concepts, particulars, and functions of social rank in a monarchy, in the book On the Nobility of the British Gentry, or the Political Ranks and Dignities of the British Empire, Compared with those on the Continent (1827).

Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. 　More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. 　The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries. 　Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. 　They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus. 　Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. 　Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. 　In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.

<font size=3>
GK CB CB RB LB RWB LWB CDM CDM RM LM CM CM RAM LAM CAM CAM RW LW CF CF ST ST A midfielder is an outfield position in association football. 　Midfielders may play an exclusively right back role, breaking up attacks, and are in that case known as defensive midfielders. 　As central midfielders often go across boundaries, with mobility and passing ability, they are often referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box midfielders, or holding midfielders. 　There are also attacking midfielders with limited defensive assignments. 　The size of midfield units on a team and their assigned roles depend on what formation is used; the unit of these players on the pitch is commonly referred to as the midfield. 　Its name derives from the fact that midfield units typically make up the in-between units to the defensive units and forward units of a formation. 　Managers frequently assign one or more midfielders to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. 　Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. 　Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch. 　Midfielders are often assigned the task of assisting forwards to create scoring chances.

Coordinates: 39°00′N 75°30′W﻿ / ﻿39.0°N 75.5°W﻿ / 39.0; -75.5﻿ (State of Delaware) Delaware (/ˈdɛləwɛər/ (listen) DEL-ə-wair) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Maryland to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. 　The state takes its name from the adjacent Delaware Bay, in turn named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. 　Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. 　It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. 　Delaware's largest city is Wilmington, while the state capital is Dover, the second-largest city in the state. 　The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of counties of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. 　While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle is more urbanized, being part of the Delaware Valley Metropolitan Statistical Area centered on Philadelphia. 　Although included in the Southern United States by the Census Bureau, Delaware's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country. 　Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. 　It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631. 　Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that took part in the American Revolution. 　On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, and has since been known as The First State. 　Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware is also a de facto onshore corporate haven, in which by virtue of its corporate laws, the state is the domicile of over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed business and over three-fifths of the Fortune 500.

Bulgaria (/bʌlˈɡɛəriə, bʊl-/ (listen); Bulgarian: България, romanized: Bǎlgariya), officially the Republic of Bulgaria, is a country in Southeast Europe. 　It is situated on the eastern flank of the Balkans, and is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. 　Bulgaria covers a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), and is the sixteenth-largest country in Europe. 　Sofia is the nation's capital and largest city; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. 　One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. 　In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts and Macedonians; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45. 　After the Roman state splintered, tribal invasions in the region resumed. 　Around the 6th century, these territories were settled by the early Slavs. 　The Bulgars, led by Asparuh, attacked from the lands of Old Great Bulgaria and permanently invaded the Balkans in the late 7th century. 　They established First Bulgarian Empire, victoriously recognised by treaty in 681 AD by the Eastern Roman Empire. 　It dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. 　The First Bulgarian Empire lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. 　A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II (1218–1241). 　After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated and in 1396 fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. 　The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. 　Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. 　In 1946, Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc and became a socialist state. 　The ruling Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multiparty elections. 　Bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy. 　Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. 　Bulgaria is a developing country, with an upper-middle-income economy, ranking 68th in the Human Development Index. 　Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and is largely based on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. 　Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018. 　The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population slowly shrinking, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988, to roughly 6.5 million today. 　Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is also a founding member of the OSCE, and has taken a seat on the United Nations Security Council three times.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_(hydrology)>Armor (hydrology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In hydrology and geography, armor is the association of surface pebbles, rocks or boulders with stream beds or beaches. 　Most commonly hydrological armor occurs naturally; however, a man-made form is usually called riprap, when shorelines or stream banks are fortified for erosion protection with large boulders or sizable manufactured concrete objects. 　When armor is associated with beaches in the form of pebbles to medium-sized stones grading from two to 200 millimeters across, the resulting landform is often termed a shingle beach. 　Hydrological modeling indicates that stream armor typically persists in a flood stage environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture>Torture</a> 
<font size=3>
Torture is the deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering on a person for reasons such as punishment, extracting a confession, interrogation for information, or intimidating third parties. 　Some definitions are restricted to acts carried out by the state, but others include non-state organizations. 　Torture has been carried out since ancient times. 　In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Western countries abolished the official use of torture in the judicial system, but torture continued to be used throughout the world. 　A variety of methods of torture are used, often in combination; the most common form of physical torture is beatings. 　Since the twentieth century, many torturers have preferred non-scarring or psychological methods to provide deniability. 　Torturers are enabled by organizations that facilitate and encourage their behavior. 　Most victims of torture are poor and marginalized people suspected of crimes, although torture against political prisoners or during armed conflict has received disproportionate attention. 　Judicial corporal punishment and capital punishment are sometimes seen as forms of torture, but this label is internationally controversial. 　Torture aims to break the victim's will and destroy their agency and personality. 　It is one of the most damaging experiences that a person can undergo and can also negatively affect perpetrating individuals and institutions. 　Public opinion research has shown general opposition to torture. 　Torture is prohibited under international law for all states under all circumstances and is explicitly forbidden by several treaties. 　Opposition to torture stimulated the formation of the human rights movement after World War II, and torture continues to be an important human rights issue. 　Although its incidence has declined, torture is still practiced by some countries.

<font size=3>
A seminary, school of theology, theological seminary, or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students (sometimes called seminarians) in scripture, theology, generally to prepare them for ordination to serve as clergy, in academics, or mostly in Christian ministry. 　The English word is taken from the Latin seminarium, translated as seed-bed, an image taken from the Council of Trent document Cum adolescentium aetas which called for the first modern seminaries. 　In the United States, the term is currently used for graduate-level theological institutions, but historically it was used for high schools.

<font size=3>
Dame is an honorific title and the feminine form of address for the honour of damehood in many Christian chivalric orders, as well as the British honours system and those of several other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, with the masculine form of address being Sir. 　It is the female equivalent for knighthood, which is traditionally granted to males. 　Dame is also style used by baronetesses in their own right. 　A woman appointed to the grades of the Dame Commander or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint John, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Most Honourable Order of the Bath, the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, the Royal Victorian Order, or the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire becomes a dame. 　A Central European order in which female members receive the rank of Dame is the Imperial and Royal Order of Saint George. 　Since there is no female equivalent to a Knight Bachelor, women are always appointed to an order of chivalry. 　Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame.

<font size=3>
Graphics (from Ancient Greek γραφικός (graphikós) 'pertaining to drawing, painting, writing, etc.　') are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain. 　In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software. 　Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics. 　Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, mathematical graphs, line graphs, charts, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. 　Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. 　Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. 　The objective can be clarity or effective communication, association with other cultural elements, or merely the creation of a distinctive style. 　Graphics can be functional or artistic. 　The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred. 　It can also be used for architecture.
