<font size=3>
In human anatomy, the forehead is an area of the head bounded by three features, two of the skull and one of the scalp. 　The top of the forehead is marked by the hairline, the edge of the area where hair on the scalp grows. 　The bottom of the forehead is marked by the supraorbital ridge, the bone feature of the skull above the eyes. 　The two sides of the forehead are marked by the temporal ridge, a bone feature that links the supraorbital ridge to the coronal suture line and beyond. 　However, the eyebrows do not form part of the forehead. 　In Terminologia Anatomica, sinciput is given as the Latin equivalent to "forehead". 　(Etymology of sinciput: from semi- "half" + caput "head".)

<font size=3>
A scholarship is a form of financial aid awarded to students for further education. 　Generally, scholarships are awarded based on a set of criteria such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need. 　Scholarship criteria usually reflect the values and goals of the donor of the award, and while scholarship recipients are not required to repay scholarships, the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements during their period of support, such maintaining a minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity (e.g., playing on a school sports team for athletic scholarship holders). 　Scholarships also range in generosity; some range from covering partial tuition ranging all the way to a 'full-ride', covering all tuition, accommodation, housing and others. 　Some prestigious, highly competitive scholarships are well-known even outside the academic community, such as Fulbright Scholarship and the Rhodes Scholarships at the graduate level, and the Robertson, Morehead-Cain and Jefferson Scholarships at the undergraduate level.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography>Photography</a> 
<font size=3>
Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. 　It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. 　Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. 　With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. 　The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. 　A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

Baltimore (/ˈbɔːltɪmɔːr/ BAWL-tim-or, locally: /bɔːldəˈmɔːr/ bawl-da-MOR or /ˈbɔːlmər/ BAWL-mər) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland, the fourth most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic, and the 30th most populous city in the United States with a population of 585,708 in 2020. 　Baltimore was designated an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851, and today it is the most populous independent city in the nation. 　As of 2021, the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be 2,838,327, making it the nation's 20th largest metropolitan area. 　Baltimore is located about 40 miles (64 km) north northeast of Washington, D.C., making it a principal city in the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area (CSA), the third-largest CSA in the nation, with a 2021 estimated population of 9,946,526. 　Prior to European colonization, the Baltimore region was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannock Native Americans, who were primarily settled further northwest than where the city was later built. 　Colonists from the Province of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe, and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729. 　The first printing press and newspapers were introduced to Baltimore by Nicholas Hasselbach and William Goddard respectively, in the mid-18th century. 　The Battle of Baltimore was a pivotal engagement during the War of 1812, culminating in the failed British bombardment of Fort McHenry, during which Francis Scott Key wrote a poem that would become "The Star-Spangled Banner", which was eventually designated as the American national anthem in 1931. 　During the Pratt Street Riot of 1861, the city was the site of some of the earliest violence associated with the American Civil War. 　The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the oldest railroad in the United States, was built in 1830 and cemented Baltimore's status as a major transportation hub, giving producers in the Midwest and Appalachia access to the city's port. 　Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States. 　In addition, Baltimore was a major manufacturing center. 　After a decline in major manufacturing, heavy industry, and restructuring of the rail industry, Baltimore has shifted to a service-oriented economy. 　Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University are the city's top two employers. 　Baltimore and its surrounding region are home to the headquarters of a number of major organizations and government agencies, including the NAACP, ABET, the National Federation of the Blind, Catholic Relief Services, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, World Relief, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Social Security Administration. 　Baltimore is also home to the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball and the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. 　Many of Baltimore's neighborhoods have rich histories. 　The city is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation, including Fell's Point, Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. 　These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971, soon after historic preservation legislation was passed. 　Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country. 　Nearly one third of the city's buildings (over 65,000) are designated as historic in the National Register, which is more than any other U.S. city. 　Baltimore has 66 National Register Historic Districts and 33 local historic districts. 　The historical records of the government of Baltimore are located at the Baltimore City Archives.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife>Wildlife</a> 
<font size=3>
Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. 　Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. 　Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. 　Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. 　While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. 　Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and quality of life. 　However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. 　This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature. 　Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. 　Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. 　This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. 　Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment. 　Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth, and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event. 　According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.

Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication. 　In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed towards a deity or a deified ancestor. 　More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of thanksgiving or praise, and in comparative religion is closely associated with more abstract forms of meditation and with charms or spells. 　Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set liturgy or ritual, and it can be performed alone or in groups. 　Prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. 　The act of prayer is attested in written sources as early as 5000 years ago. 　Today, most major religions involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time. 　Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. 　The efficacy of prayer in faith healing has been evaluated in numerous studies, with contradictory results.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower>Flower</a> 
<font size=3>
A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). 　The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. 　Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs. 　There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and cross-pollination. 　Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. 　Cross-pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. 　Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. 　This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. 　Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). 　Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. 　Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. 　After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. 　In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to the environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft, religion, holistic medicine, and as a source of food.

<font size=3>
An ion (/ˈaɪ.ɒn, -ən/) is an atom or molecule with a net electrical charge. 　The charge of an electron is considered to be negative by convention and this charge is equal and opposite to the charge of a proton, which is considered to be positive by convention. 　The net charge of an ion is not zero because its total number of electrons is unequal to its total number of protons. 　A cation is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons while an anion is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons. 　Opposite electric charges are pulled towards one another by electrostatic force, so cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds. 　Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions, while two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. 　In the case of physical ionization in a fluid (gas or liquid), "ion pairs" are created by spontaneous molecule collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion. 　Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a direct current through a conducting solution, dissolving an anode via ionization.

A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. 　It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. 　Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of their life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. 　Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. 　One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. 　Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the genre known as biography. 　An authorized biography is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. 　An autobiography is written by the person themselves, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or ghostwriter.

Cleveland (/ˈkliːvlənd/ KLEEV-lənd), officially the City of Cleveland, is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County. 　Located in the northeastern part of the state, it is situated along the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada, 252 miles (406 km) northeast of Cincinnati, 143 miles (230 km) northeast of Columbus, and approximately 60 miles (97 km) west of Pennsylvania. 　The largest city on Lake Erie and one of the major cities of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland ranks as the 54th-largest city in the U.S. with a 2020 population of 372,624. 　The city anchors both the Greater Cleveland metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton combined statistical area (CSA). 　The CSA is the most populous in Ohio and the 17th-largest in the country, with a population of 3.63 million in 2020, while the MSA ranks as 34th-largest at 2.09 million. 　Cleveland was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River by General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city was named. 　Its location on both the river and the lake shore allowed it to grow into a major commercial and industrial center, attracting large numbers of immigrants and migrants. 　Cleveland is a port city, connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 　Its economy relies on diverse sectors that include higher education, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedicals. 　The GDP for the Greater Cleveland MSA was $135 billion in 2019. 　Combined with the Akron MSA, the seven-county Cleveland–Akron metropolitan economy was $175 billion in 2019, the largest in Ohio, accounting for 25% of the state's GDP. 　Designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, Cleveland is home to several major cultural institutions, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 　Known as "The Forest City" among many other nicknames, Cleveland serves as the center of the Cleveland Metroparks nature reserve system. 　The city's major league professional sports teams include the Cleveland Browns, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Cleveland Guardians.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster>Monster</a> 
<font size=3>
A monster is a type of fictional creature found in horror, fantasy, science fiction, folklore, mythology and religion. 　Monsters are very often depicted as dangerous and aggressive with a strange, grotesque appearance that causes terror and fear. 　Monsters usually resemble bizarre, deformed, otherworldly and/or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of varying sizes, but may also take a human form, such as mutants, ghosts and spirits, zombies or cannibals, among other things. 　They may or may not have supernatural powers, but are usually capable of killing or causing some form of destruction, threatening the social or moral order of the human world in the process. 　Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice to Poseidon the white bull which the god sent him, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull. She copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, the Minotaur). 　Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human (Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity (werewolves, Frankenstein's monster), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society. 　Monsters may also be depicted as misunderstood and friendly creatures who frighten individuals away without wanting to, or may be so large, strong and clumsy that they cause unintentional damage or death. 　Some monsters in fiction are depicted as mischievous and boisterous but not necessarily threatening (such as a sly goblin), while others may be docile but prone to becoming angry or hungry, thus needing to be tamed and taught to resist savage urges, or killed if they cannot be handled or controlled successfully. 　Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as monstrophy. 　Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. 　Well-known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, vampires, demons, mummies, and zombies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(psychology)>Identification (psychology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Identification is a psychological process whereby the individual assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other and is transformed wholly or partially by the model that other provides. 　It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. 　The roots of the concept can be found in Freud's writings. 　The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, narcissistic (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification. 　While "in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another", it has also been adjudged '"the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area" in psychoanalysis'.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(biology)>Identification (biology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Identification in biology is the process of assigning a pre-existing taxon name to an individual organism. 　Identification of organisms to individual scientific names (or codes) may be based on individualistic natural body features, experimentally created individual markers (e.g., color dot patterns), or natural individualistic molecular markers (similar to those used in maternity or paternity identification tests). 　Individual identification is used in ecology, wildlife management and conservation biology. 　The more common form of identification is the identification of organisms to common names (e. g., "lion") or scientific name (e. g., "Panthera leo"). 　By necessity this is based on inherited features ("characters") of the sexual organisms, the inheritance forming the basis of defining a class. 　The features may, e. 　g.　, be morphological, anatomical, physiological, behavioral, or molecular. 　The term "determination" may occasionally be used as a synonym for identification (e. g.), or as in "determination slips". 　Identification methods may be manual or computerized and may involve using identification keys, browsing through fields guide that contain (often illustrated) species accounts, comparing the organism with specimens from natural history collections, or taking images to be analyzed and compared against a pre-trained knowledge base with species information.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment>Payment</a> 
<font size=3>
A payment is the voluntary tender of money or its equivalent or of things of value by one party (such as a person or company) to another in exchange for goods or services provided by them or to fulfill a legal obligation. 　The party making the payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment. 　Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example: the use of money, cheque, or debit, credit, or bank transfers, whether through mobile payment or otherwise the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, or personal data, the exchange of one good or service for another. 　In general, payees are at liberty to determine what method of payment they will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit. 　Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee unless the parties agree otherwise. 　Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction. 　The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. 　On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc. 　Payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follows the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is not uncommon for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided. 　In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. 　In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer’s legal obligations. 　The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. 　A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. 　A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer. 　A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as "paid in full". 　The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.
