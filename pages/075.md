<font size=3>
Ash or ashes are the solid remnants of fires. 　Specifically, ash refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something burns. 　In analytical chemistry, to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples, ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after complete combustion. 　Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion are mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. 　The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc. 　The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal from incomplete combustion. 　The ashes are of different types. 　Some ashes contain natural compounds that make soil fertile. 　Others have chemical compounds that can be toxic but may break up in soil from chemical changes and microorganism activity. 　Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). 　The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as alternative when soap is not available.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion>Rebellion</a> 
<font size=3>
Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. 　It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established authority.　[citation needed] A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation.　[citation needed] Rebellion can be individual or collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance, and nonviolent resistance) or violent (terrorism, sabotage and guerrilla warfare).　[citation needed] Rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. 　While rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. 　The goal of rebellion is resistance while a revolt seeks a revolution.　[citation needed] As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed coalition, or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion>Diffusion</a> 
<font size=3>
Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy) generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. 　Diffusion is driven by a gradient in Gibbs free energy or chemical potential. 　It is possible to diffuse "uphill" from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, like in spinodal decomposition. 　The concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including physics (particle diffusion), chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). 　The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: a substance or collection undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that substance or collection. 　A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, pressure, or temperature with the change in another variable, usually distance. 　A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient, and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient. 　The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, diffundere, which means "to spread out." 　A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle random walk, and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. 　Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of advection. 　The term convection is used to describe the combination of both transport phenomena. 　If a diffusion process can be described by Fick's laws, it's called a normal diffusion (or Fickian diffusion); Otherwise, it's called an anomalous diffusion (or non-Fickian diffusion). 　When talking about the extent of diffusion, two length scales are used in two different scenarios: Brownian motion of an impulsive point source (for example, one single spray of perfume)—the square root of the mean squared displacement from this point. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 n D t {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2nDt}}} , where n {\displaystyle n} is the dimension of this Brownian motion; Constant concentration source in one dimension—the diffusion length. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 D t {\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {Dt}}} .

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast>Breast</a> 
<font size=3>
The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso. 　Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. 　In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. 　Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape. 　At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. 　During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. 　Humans are the only animals with permanent breasts. 　At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause permanent breast growth in female humans. 　This happens only to a much lesser extent in other primates—breast development in other primates generally only occurs with pregnancy. 　Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. 　Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. 　They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness. 　A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. 　Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone.

<font size=3>
In archaeology, the general meaning of horizon is a distinctive type of sediment, artefact, style, or other cultural trait that is found across a large geographical area from a limited time period. 　The term derives from similar ones in geology, horizon or marker horizon, but where these have natural causes, archaeological horizons are caused by humans. 　Most typically, there is a change in the type of pottery found and in the style of less frequent major artefacts. 　Across a horizon, the same type of artefact or style is found very widely over a large area, and it can be assumed that these traces are approximately contemporary.

<font size=3>
In geology, a horizon is either a bedding surface where there is marked change in the lithology within a sequence of sedimentary or volcanic rocks, or a distinctive layer or thin bed with a characteristic lithology or fossil content within a sequence. 　Examples of the former can include things such as volcanic eruptions as well as things such as meteorite impacts and tsunamis. 　Examples of the latter include things such as ice ages and other large climate events, as well as large but temporary geological features and changes such as inland oceans. 　In the interpretation of seismic reflection data, horizons are the reflectors (or seismic events) picked on individual profiles. 　These reflectors represent a change in rock properties across a boundary between two layers of rock, particularly seismic velocity and density. 　It can also represent changes in the density of the material and the composition of it and the pressure under which it was produced. 　Thus, not only do the properties change but so too do the conditions of formation and other differences in the rock. 　The horizons can sometimes be very prominent, such as visible changes in cliff sides, to extremely subtle chemical differences.

<font size=3>
The horizon is the apparent curve that separates the surface of a celestial body from its sky when viewed from the perspective of an observer on or near the surface of the relevant body. 　This curve divides all viewing directions based on whether it intersects the relevant body's surface or not. 　The true horizon is a theoretical line, which can only be observed to any degree of accuracy when it lies along a relatively smooth surface such as that of Earth's oceans. 　At many locations, this line is obscured by terrain, and on Earth it can also be obscured by life forms such as trees and/or human constructs such as buildings. 　The resulting intersection of such obstructions with the sky is called the visible horizon. 　On Earth, when looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing. 　The true horizon surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the relevant celestial body, i.e., a small circle of the local osculating sphere. 　With respect to Earth, the center of the true horizon is below the observer and below sea level. 　Its radius or horizontal distance from the observer varies slightly from day to day due to atmospheric refraction, which is greatly affected by weather conditions. 　Also, the higher the observer's eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer. 　For instance, in standard atmospheric conditions, for an observer with eye level above sea level by 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). 　When observed from very high standpoints, such as a space station, the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth's surface. 　In this case, the horizon would no longer be a perfect circle, not even a plane curve such as an ellipse, especially when the observer is above the equator, as the Earth's surface can be better modeled as an oblate ellipsoid than as a sphere.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwing>Throwing</a> 
<font size=3>
Throwing is an action which consists in accelerating a projectile and then releasing it so that it follows a ballistic trajectory, usually with the aim of impacting a remote target. 　This action is best characterized for animals with prehensile limbs: in this case the projectile is grasped, while the limb segments impart a motion of the hand through compounded mechanical advantage. 　For other animals, the definition of throwing is somewhat unclear, as other actions such as spitting or spraying may or may not be included. 　Primates are the most capable throwers in the animal kingdom, and they typically throw feces as a form of agonistic behavior. 　Of all primates, humans are by far the most capable throwers. 　They throw a large variety of projectiles, with a much greater efficacy and accuracy. 　Humans have thrown projectiles for hunting and in warfare – first through rock-throwing, then refined weapon-throwing (e.g. spear), and into modern day with hand grenades and tear gas canisters. 　If humans initially threw objects by hand, they very early designed tools to improve the efficiency of their throwing techniques. 　The sling, the bow and arrow, and various models of catapults are notable examples of throwing mechanisms. 　With the advent of gun powder, research in throwing mechanisms as ranged weapons essentially halted, but throwing either by hand or with mechanical assistance has persisted for recreational purpose or as a form of exercise. 　Throwing is thus still performed in many sports and games, particularly ball games, and in throwing sports the action is the main determiner of the outcome.

Mechanics (from Ancient Greek: μηχανική, mēkhanikḗ, lit. "of machines") is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. 　Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment. 　Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). 　During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. 　As a branch of classical physics, mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 　It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy>Privacy</a> 
<font size=3>
Privacy (UK: /ˈprɪvəsiː/, US: /ˈpraɪ-/) is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. 　Etymology of the word privacy: the word privacy is derived from the Latin word "privatus" which means set apart from what is public, personal and belonging to oneself, and not to the state. 　The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. 　Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity. 　The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations, or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. 　The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern concept primarily associated with Western culture, particularly British and North American, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. 　Now, most cultures recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of personal information from wider society. 　With the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has shifted from a bodily sense to a digital sense. 　As the world has become digital, there have been conflicts regarding the legal right to privacy and where it is applicable. 　In most countries, the right to a reasonable expectation to digital privacy has been extended from the original right to privacy, and many countries, notably the US, under its agency, the Federal Trade Commission, and those within the European Union (EU), have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities and grant additional rights to users of technology. 　With the rise of the Internet, there has been an increase in the prevalence of social bots, causing political polarization and harassment. 　Online harassment has also spiked, particularly with teenagers, which has consequently resulted in multiple privacy breaches. 　Selfie culture, the prominence of networks like Facebook and Instagram, location technology, and the use of advertisements and their tracking methods also pose threats to digital privacy. 　Through the rise of technology and immensity of the debate regarding privacy, there have been various conceptions of privacy, which include the right to be let alone as defined in "The Right to Privacy", the first U.S. publication discussing privacy as a legal right, to the theory of the privacy paradox, which describes the notion that users' online may say they are concerned about their privacy, but in reality, are not. 　Along with various understandings of privacy, there are actions that reduce privacy, the most recent classification includes processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information, as defined by Daniel J. Solove. 　Conversely, in order to protect a user's privacy, multiple steps can be taken, specifically through practicing encryption, anonymity, and taking further measures to bolster the security of their data.

Muhammad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد; c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. 　According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. 　He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam. 　Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. 　Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE in Mecca. 　He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. 　His father Abdullah was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad's birth. 　His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. 　He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. 　In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. 　When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. 　In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam. 　Muhammad's followers were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists for 13 years. 　To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. 　This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. 　In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. 　In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. 　The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. 　In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. 　By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam. 　The revelations (each known as Ayah — literally, "Sign [of God]") that Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" on which the religion is based. 　Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira (biography) literature, are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation>Elevation</a> 
<font size=3>
The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic datum § Vertical datum). 　The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface. 　Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth. 　Due to the equatorial bulge, the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have, respectively, the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative>Narrative</a> 
<font size=3>
A narrative, story, or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional (memoir, biography, news report, documentary, travelogue, etc.) or fictional (fairy tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc.). 　Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words, through still or moving images, or through any combination of these. 　The word derives from the Latin verb narrare (to tell), which is derived from the adjective gnarus (knowing or skilled). 　Narration (i.e., the process of presenting a narrative) is a rhetorical mode of discourse, broadly defined (and paralleling argumentation, description, and exposition), is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. 　More narrowly defined, it is the fiction-writing mode[dubious – discuss] in which a narrator communicates directly to an audience. 　The school of literary criticism known as Russian formalism has applied methods that are more often used to analyse narrative fiction, to non-fictional texts such as political speeches. 　Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives. 　During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples. 　Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including speech, literature, theatre, music and song, comics, journalism, film, television and video, video games, radio, game-play, unstructured recreation, and performance in general, as well as some painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and other visual arts, as long as a sequence of events is presented. 　Several art movements, such as modern art, refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual. 　Narrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: nonfiction (such as creative nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript poetry, and historiography); fictionalization of historical events (such as anecdote, myth, legend, and historical fiction) and fiction proper (such as literature in the form of prose and sometimes poetry, short stories, novels, narrative poems and songs, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances). 　Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator (a character) typically found in the genre of noir fiction. 　An important part of many narratives is its narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a written or spoken commentary (see also "Aesthetics approach" below).

Coordinates: 39°N 111°W﻿ / ﻿39°N 111°W﻿ / 39; -111﻿ (State of Utah) Utah (/ˈjuːtɑː/ YOO-tah, /ˈjuːtɔː/ (listen) YOO-taw) is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. 　It is bordered to its east by Colorado, to its northeast by Wyoming, to its north by Idaho, to its south by Arizona, and to its west by Nevada. 　Utah also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. 　Of the fifty U.S. states, Utah is the 13th-largest by area; with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous and 11th-least-densely populated. 　Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly two-thirds of the population and includes the capital city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the southwest, with more than 180,000 residents. 　Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin. 　Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo and Ute. 　The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though the region's difficult geography and harsh climate made it a peripheral part of New Spain and later Mexico. 　Even while it was Mexican territory, many of Utah's earliest settlers were American, particularly Mormons fleeing marginalization and persecution from the United States. 　Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the region was annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included what is now Colorado and Nevada. 　Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state; only after the outlawing of polygamy was it admitted in 1896 as the 45th. 　People from Utah are known as Utahns. 　Slightly over half of all Utahns are Mormons, the vast majority of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City; Utah is the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church. 　The LDS Church greatly influences Utahn culture, politics, and daily life, though since the 1990s the state has become more religiously diverse as well as secular. 　Utah has a highly diversified economy, with major sectors including transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, and tourism. 　Utah has been one of the fastest growing states since 2000, with the 2020 U.S. census confirming the fastest population growth in the nation since 2010. 　St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005. 　Utah ranks among the overall best states in metrics such as healthcare, governance, education, and infrastructure. 　It has the 14th-highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. 　Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Utah have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Utah's water security and impacting the state’s economy.
