## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid>Acid</a> 
<font size=3>
An acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton (i.e. hydrogen ion, H+), known as a Brønsted–Lowry acid, or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair, known as a Lewis acid. 　The first category of acids are the proton donors, or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids. 　Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. 　A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+. 　Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid. 　Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. 　The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus, meaning 'sour'. 　An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as "acid" (as in "dissolved in acid"), while the strict definition refers only to the solute. 　A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. 　Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic. 　Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride that is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). 　As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. 　Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid. 　The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. 　An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3). 　Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. 　Hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted–Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair, however, and are therefore not Lewis acids. 　Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest>Protest</a> 
<font size=3>
A protest (also called a demonstration, remonstration or remonstrance or a maree richo) is a public expression of objection, disapproval or dissent towards an idea or action, typically a political one. 　Protests can be thought of as acts of cooperation in which numerous people cooperate by attending, and share the potential costs and risks of doing so. 　Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. 　Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves. 　Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as a type of protest called civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. 　Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. 　One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. 　Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing in many countries, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against protesters. 　When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration. 　A protest itself may at times be the subject of a counter-protest. 　In such cases, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. 　Protesters and counter-protesters can sometimes violently clash. 　One study found that non-violent activism during the civil rights movement in the United States tended to produce favorable media coverage and changes in public opinion focusing on the issues organizers were raising, but violent protests tended to generate unfavorable media coverage that generated public desire to restore law and order.

<font size=3>
A knife (PL: knives; from Old Norse knifr 'knife, dirk') is a tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. 　One of the earliest tools used by humanity, knives appeared at least 2.5 million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools. 　Originally made of wood, bone, and stone (such as flint and obsidian), over the centuries, in step with improvements in both metallurgy and manufacturing, knife blades have been made from copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and titanium. 　Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin. 　Knives can serve various purposes. 　Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocket knife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods (the chef's knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knives (butter knives and steak knives), weapons (daggers or switchblades), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the kirpan).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity>Complexity</a> 
<font size=3>
Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to nonlinearity, randomness, collective dynamics, hierarchy, and emergence. 　The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. 　The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory. 　The intuitive criterion of complexity can be formulated as follows: a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished, and if more connections between them existed. 　Science as of 2010[update] takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed et al. reflect many of these. 　Neil Johnson states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..." 　Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea>Tea</a> 
<font size=3>
Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar. 　Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis. 　After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. 　There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. 　Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content. 　An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo. 　It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. 　Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. 　During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India. 　The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis. 　They are the infusions of fruit, leaves, or other plant parts, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. 　These may be called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.

<font size=3>
In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. 　Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. 　The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. 　A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. 　The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. 　The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. 　Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. 　Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. 　Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. 　These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. 　In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio>Antonio</a> 
<font size=3>
Antonio is a masculine given name of Etruscan origin deriving from the root name Antonius. 　It is a common name among Romance language–speaking populations as well as the Balkans and Lusophone Africa. 　It has been among the top 400 most popular male baby names in the United States since the late 19th century and has been among the top 200 since the mid 20th century. 　In the English language it is translated as Anthony, and has some female derivatives: Antonia, Antónia, Antonieta, Antonietta, and Antonella'. 　It also has some male derivatives, such as Anthonio, Antón, Antò, Antonis, Antoñito, Antonino, Antonello, Tonio, Tono, Toño, Toñín, Tonino, Nantonio, Ninni, Totò, Tó, Tonini, Tony, Toni, Toninho, Toñito, and Tõnis. 　The Portuguese equivalent is António (Portuguese orthography) or Antônio (Brazilian Portuguese). 　In old Portuguese the form Antão was also used, not just to differentiate between older and younger but also between more and less important.　[citation needed] In Galician the form is Antón, in Catalan Antò, and in Basque Antxon. 　The Greek versions of the name are Antonios (Αντώνιος) and Antonis (Αντώνης). 　The name derives from Antonius, a well-known Latin family name, probably of Etruscan origin. 　The Roman general Marcus Antonius held that the origin of the name was Anthon (Ανθών), son of Hercules. 　This myth, recorded by Plutarch, was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. 　The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. 　When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. 　Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).

Mississippi (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi/ (listen)) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the north by Tennessee; to the east by Alabama; to the south by the Gulf of Mexico; to the southwest by Louisiana; and to the northwest by Arkansas. 　Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the Mississippi River. 　Mississippi is the 32nd largest and 35th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states and has the lowest per-capita income in the United States. 　Jackson is both the state's capital and largest city. 　Greater Jackson is the state's most populous metropolitan area, with a population of 591,978 in 2020. 　On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union. 　By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top cotton-producing state and slaves accounted for 55% of the state population. 　Mississippi declared its secession from the Union on January 9, 1861, and was one of the seven original Confederate States, which constituted the largest slaveholding states in the nation. 　Following the Civil War, it was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870. 　Until the Great Migration of the 1930s, African Americans were a majority of Mississippi's population. 　In 2020, 37.6% of Mississippi's population was African American, the highest percentage of any state. 　Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the civil rights movement, including the Ole Miss riot of 1962 by white students objecting to desegregation, the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders of three activists working on voting rights. 　Mississippi frequently ranks low among U.S. states in measures of health, education, and development, while ranking high in measures of poverty. 　Top economic industries in Mississippi today are agriculture and forestry. 　Mississippi produces more than half of the country's farm-raised catfish, and is also a top producer of sweet potatoes, cotton and pulpwood. 　Other main industries in Mississippi include advanced manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and health services. 　Mississippi is almost entirely within the Gulf coastal plain, and generally consists of lowland plains and low hills. 　The northwest remainder of the state consists of the Mississippi Delta, a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. 　Mississippi's highest point is Woodall Mountain at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the Cumberland Plateau; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. 　Mississippi has a humid subtropical climate classification.

<font size=3>
A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional, content. 　The word originates from the Latin Documentumcode: lat promoted to code: la , which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceōcode: lat promoted to code: la denotes "to teach". 　In the past, the word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. 　In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. 　Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. 　"Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". 　Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2-dimensional representations. 　While documents can have large varieties of customization, all documents can be shared freely and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. 　History, events, examples, opinions, etc. all can be expressed in documents.

<font size=3>
Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. 　Twins can be either monozygotic ('identical'), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ('non-identical' or 'fraternal'), meaning that each twin develops from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm cell. 　Since identical twins develop from one zygote, they will share the same sex, while fraternal twins may or may not. 　In rare cases twins can have the same mother and different fathers (heteropaternal superfecundation). 　In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb (the much more common case, in humans) is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is a multiple. 　Unrelated look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgängers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism>Criticism</a> 
<font size=3>
Criticism is the construction of a judgement about the negative qualities of someone or something. 　Criticism can range from impromptu comments to a written detailed response. 　Criticism falls into several overlapping types including "theoretical, practical, impressionistic, affective, prescriptive, or descriptive". 　Criticism may also refer to an expression of disapproval. 　When criticism of this nature is constructive it can make an individual aware of gaps in their understanding and it can provide distinct routes for improvement. 　Research supports the notion that using feedback and constructive criticism in the learning process is very influential. 　Critique vs criticism In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and 'criticism'. 　The two words both translate as critique, Kritik, and critica, respectively. 　In the English language, philosopher Gianni Vattimo suggests that criticism is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism while critique refers to more general and profound writing as Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. 　Another distinction that is sometimes made is that critique is never personalized nor ad hominem and is presented in a way that encourages rebuttal or expansion of the ideas expressed. 　Nonetheless, the distinctions are subtle and ambiguous at best. 　The term "brickbat" is sometimes used to mean "an unfavourable criticism, unkind remark or sharp put-down". 　The term originated in the 17th century, derived from the practice of throwing bricks as projectiles at a person who was disapproved of. 　In some contexts, such as literary criticism and art criticism, the word criticism is used as a neutral word that is synonymous with evaluation.
