## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin>Cousin</a> 
<font size=3>
Most generally, in the lineal kinship system used in the English-speaking world, a cousin is a type of familial relationship in which two relatives are two or more familial generations away from their most recent common ancestor. 　Commonly, "cousin" refers to a first cousin – a relative of the same generation whose most recent common ancestor with the subject is a grandparent. 　Degrees and removals are separate measures used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins. 　Degree measures the separation, in generations, from the most recent common ancestor(s) to a parent of one of the cousins (whichever is closest), while removal measures the difference in generations between the cousins themselves, relative to their most recent common ancestor(s). 　To illustrate usage, a second cousin is a cousin with a degree of two; there are three (not two) generations from the common ancestor(s). 　When the degree is not specified, first cousin is assumed. 　A cousin "once removed" is a cousin with one removal. 　When the removal is not specified, no removal is assumed. 　Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past; for example, in medicine and in law, a first cousin is a type of third-degree relative.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan>Loan</a> 
<font size=3>
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. 　The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. 　The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and the date of repayment. 　A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. 　The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. 　In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. 　Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent. 　Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. 　For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

<font size=3>
Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. 　In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind. 　The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. 　In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. 　However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. 　Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. 　Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. 　Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. 　Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). 　This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. 　The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology. 　Measurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.

A reign is the period of a person's or dynasty's occupation of the office of monarch of a nation (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Andorra), of a people (e.g., the Franks, the Zulus) or of a spiritual community (e.g., Catholicism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nizari Ismailism). 　In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g., Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. 　Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. 　In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office (e.g., Malaysia). 　The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation "r." (for Latin rexit) after a sovereign's name, such as the following: George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India (r. 1936–1952)

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland>Switzerland</a> 
<font size=3>
Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country located at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. 　It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. 　Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas the Swiss population of approximately 8.7 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel. 　Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. 　The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. 　Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality. 　Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. 　Switzerland has not fought an international war since 1815. 　It joined the United Nations only in 2002, though it pursues an active foreign policy, including participation in frequent peace-building processes worldwide. 　Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best-known humanitarian organisations, and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, FIFA, and the United Nations. 　It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but not part of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, or the Eurozone; however, it participates in the European single market and the Schengen Area through bilateral treaties. 　Switzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern. 　It has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. 　Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. 　This identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnationcode: deu promoted to code: de ("nation of volition") rather than a nation state. 　Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by multiple native names: Schweizcode: deu promoted to code: de [ˈʃvaɪts] (German); Suisse [sɥis(ə)] audio (help·info) (French); Svizzeracode: ita promoted to code: it [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizracode: roh promoted to code: rm [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh). 　On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la — frequently shortened to "Helvetia" — is used instead of the spoken languages. 　Switzerland is one of the world's most developed countries. 　It has the highest nominal wealth per adult of any country and the eighth-highest gross domestic product per capita. 　Switzerland ranks first in the Human Development Index since 2021 and performs highly also on several international metrics, including economic competitiveness and democratic governance. 　Cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality of life, albeit with some of the highest costs of living.

A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface water or underground streams. 　Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. 　Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. 　A dam can also be used to collect or store water which can be evenly distributed between locations. 　Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. 　The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, dating to 3,000 BC. 　The word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities, such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

A ridge or a mountain ridge is a geographical feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for an extended amount of distance. 　The sides of the ridge slope away from the narrow top on either side. 　The lines along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, are called the ridgelines. 　Ridges are usually termed hills or mountains as well, depending on their size. 　Smaller ridges, especially those leaving a larger ridge, are often called to as spurs.

<font size=3>
A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. 　An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. 　Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. 　In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging money, goods, etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. 　Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. 　By extension the term gift can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness. 　Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country in Southeast Europe. 　It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. 　Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. 　The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. 　Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. 　The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.4 million. 　Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras. 　Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. 　From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 　Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. 　The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. 　Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. 　The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. 　After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. 　The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy, and a high quality of life, ranking 32nd in the Human Development Index. 　Its economy is among the largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. 　A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. 　It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, and the OSCE. 　Greece has a unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, and prominent shipping sector.

<font size=3>
In mathematical morphology, the closing of a set (binary image) A by a structuring element B is the erosion of the dilation of that set, A ∙ B = ( A ⊕ B ) ⊖ B , {\displaystyle A\bullet B=(A\oplus B)\ominus B,\,} where ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } and ⊖ {\displaystyle \ominus } denote the dilation and erosion, respectively. 　In image processing, closing is, together with opening, the basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. 　Opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.
