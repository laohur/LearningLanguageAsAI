The (/ðə, ðiː/ (listen)) is a grammatical article in English, denoting persons or things already mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers. 　It is the definite article in English. 　The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words. 　It is derived from gendered articles in Old English which combined in Middle English and now has a single form used with pronouns of any gender. 　The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter. 　This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers.

As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last<br> defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it<br> as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to<br> go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my<br> utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost<br> constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no<br> prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or<br> subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's<br> country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the<br> infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed<br> the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.<br> xi. 8).<br>prep.

A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. 　Its name in English is a (pronounced /ˈeɪ/), plural aes. 　It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. 　The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. 　The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. 　The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. 　In English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", are indefinite articles.

<font size=3>
That is an English language word used for several grammatical purposes. 　These include use as an adjective, conjunction, pronoun, adverb, and intensifier; it has distance from the speaker, as opposed to words like this. 　The word did not originally exist in Old English, and its concept was represented by þe. 　Once it came into being, it was spelt as þæt (among others, such as þet), taking the role of the modern that. 　It also took on the role of the modern word what, though this has since changed, and that has recently replaced some usage of the modern which. 　Pronunciation of the word varies according to its role within a sentence, with two main varieties (a strong and a weak form), though there are also regional differences, such as where the /ð/ sound is substituted instead by a /d/ in English spoken in Cameroon.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time>Time</a> 
<font size=3>
Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. 　It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. 　Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions. 　Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. 　Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. 　Time in physics is operationally defined as "what a clock reads". 　The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime. 　Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. 　Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). 　However, the numerical values are different for different observers. 　In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. 　Distance and time are intimately related, and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. 　General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. 　At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity. 　Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. 　The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. 　Time is used to define other quantities, such as velocity, so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. 　An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. 　To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted. 　The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of time is. 　It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. 　Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. 　General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. 　Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes. 　Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. 　Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. 　Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the swing of a pendulum. 　Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("time is money") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans. 　There are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. 　In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well>Well</a> 
<font size=3>
A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. 　The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers. 　The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets or large water bags that are raised mechanically or by hand. 　Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well. 　Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India. 　Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age. 　Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world. 　These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. 　A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. 　Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. 　Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. 　Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. 　Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells. 　Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. 　A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. 　The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. 　Water may be pumped or hand drawn. 　Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. 　Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. 　Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. 　Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(sociology)>Will (sociology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In sociology, will is a concept introduced by Ferdinand Tönnies in "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft", 1887. 　Tönnies' approach was very much indebted to Spinoza's dictum voluntas atque intellectus unum et idem sunt ("will as well as ratio are one and the same"), and to Arthur Schopenhauer. 　Tönnies saw a fundamental cleavage between "essential will" (Wesenwille) creating community (Gemeinschaft), and "arbitrary will" (Kürwille), creating society (Gesellschaft) - see Ferdinand Tönnies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May>May</a> 
<font size=3>
May is the fifth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the third of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　May is a month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. 　Therefore, May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. 　Late May typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the United States (Memorial Day) and Canada (Victoria Day) that ends on Labor Day, the first Monday of September. 　May (in Latin, Maius) was named for the Greek goddess Maia, who was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility, Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May. 　Conversely, the Roman poet Ovid provides a second etymology, in which he says that the month of May is named for the maiores, Latin for "elders," and that the following month (June) is named for the iuniores, or "young people" (Fasti VI.88). 　Eta Aquariids meteor shower appears in May. 　It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 　6. The Arietids shower from May 22 – July 2, and peaks on June 　7. The Virginids also shower at various dates in May.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School>School</a> 
<font size=3>
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. 　Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. 　In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. 　The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. 　An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university. 　In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. 　Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). 　University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. 　A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. 　Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods. 　Non-government schools, also known as private schools, may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. 　Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. 　Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools. 　Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives, of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others, of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity, and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn. 　In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively. 　Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World>World</a> 
<font size=3>
In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. 　The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. 　Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". 　Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. 　In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". 　Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. 　Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". 　In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. 　Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. 　In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. 　A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. 　Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world. 　In various contexts, the term "world" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope. 　In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents. 　Other examples include terms such as "world religion", "world language", "world government", "world war", "world population", "world economy" or "world championship".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year>Year</a> 
<font size=3>
A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. 　Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. 　In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. 　In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. 　A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. 　The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars. 　For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days (97 out of 400 years are leap years). 　In English, the unit of time for year is commonly abbreviated as "y" or "yr". 　The symbol "a" is more common in scientific literature, though its exact duration may be inconsistent. 　In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. 　The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. 　Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. 　The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City>City</a> 
<font size=3>
A city is a human settlement of notable size. 　It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. 　Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. 　Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. 　Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. 　Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. 　However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. 　This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and global health. 　Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. 　Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. 　Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change. 　However, this concentration can also have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources. 　Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. 　For example, country capitals such as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex of their respective nations. 　Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto and Xi'an, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. 　Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Haridwar and Prayagraj each hold significance.
