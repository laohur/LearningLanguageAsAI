Vienna (/viˈɛnə/ (listen) vee-EN-ə; German: Wien [viːn] (listen); Austro-Bavarian: Wean [veɐ̯n]) is the capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria. 　Vienna is Austria's most populous city and its primate city, with about two million inhabitants (2.9 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political center. 　It is the 5th-largest city proper by population in the European Union and the largest of all cities on the Danube river. 　Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had two million inhabitants. 　Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin. 　Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. 　The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 　These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. 　Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. 　In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger. 　Additionally, Vienna is known as the "City of Music" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home. 　Vienna is also said to be the "City of Dreams" because it was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud. 　Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city. 　It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. 　The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks. 　Vienna is known for its high quality of life. 　In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most livable cities. 　Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne. 　Monocle's 2015 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within". 　Monocle's 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010). 　The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most prosperous city in the world in 2012–2013. 　The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets. 　Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners. 　Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions. 　It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.

<font size=3>
Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of a thing, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. 　Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression. 　To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves. 　Some sources describe abuse as "socially constructed", which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome>Welcome</a> 
<font size=3>
A welcome is a kind of greeting designed to introduce a person to a new place or situation, and to make them feel at ease. 　The term can similarly be used to describe the feeling of being accepted on the part of the new person. 　In some contexts, a welcome is extended to a stranger to an area or a household. 　"The concept of welcoming the stranger means intentionally building into the interaction those factors that make others feel that they belong, that they matter, and that you want to get to know them". 　It is also noted, however, that "[i]n many community settings, being welcoming is viewed as in conflict with ensuring safety. Thus, welcoming becomes somewhat self-limited: 'We will be welcoming unless you do something unsafe'". 　Different cultures have their own traditional forms of welcome, and a variety of different practices can go into an effort to welcome: Making a welcome is not a physical fabrication, though welcome may be embodied and fostered by appropriate physical arrangements. 　There can be an aesthetics of welcome. 　What is there when one makes a welcome? 　No thing really, and yet more than any thing. 　When one makes a welcome one creates the conditions that promise of home. 　One makes it possible for the other not any longer to feel outside or out of it, but to feel at home. 　Indications that visitors are welcome can occur at different levels. 　For example, a welcome sign, at the national, state, or municipal level, is a road sign at the border of a region that introduces or welcomes visitors to the region. 　A welcome sign might also be present for a specific community, or an individual building. 　One architect suggests that "[a] primary distinction between a gateway and a Welcome sign is that the gateway is usually designed and built by an outsider, a developer or architect, while the Welcome sign has been designed and built by an inside member of the community". 　A welcome mat is a doormat that welcomes visitors to a house or other building by providing them with a place to wipe their feet before entering. 　Another community tradition, the welcome wagon, a phrase that originally referred to an actual wagon containing a collection of useful gifts collected from residents of an area to welcome new people moving to that area.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert>Expert</a> 
<font size=3>
An expert is somebody who has a broad and deep understanding and competence in terms of knowledge, skill and experience through practice and education in a particular field. 　Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. 　An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. 　Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. 　An expert can be believed, by virtue of credentials, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion on that topic. 　Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage. 　The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. 　In specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic qualification for them to be accepted as an expert. 　In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. 　Another example from computer science is that an expert system may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. 　In law, an expert witness must be recognized by argument and authority. 　Research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. 　Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. 　The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. 　Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.

<font size=3>
Malaysia (/məˈleɪziə, -ʒə/ (listen) mə-LAY-zee-ə, -⁠zhə; Malay: [məlejsiə]) is a country in Southeast Asia. 　The federal constitutional monarchy consists of thirteen states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo's East Malaysia. 　Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. 　East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia, and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. 　Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, the country's largest city, and the seat of the legislative branch of the federal government. 　The nearby planned capital of Putrajaya is the administrative capital, which represents the seat of both the executive branch (the Cabinet, federal ministries, and agencies) and the judicial branch of the federal government. 　With a population of over 32 million, Malaysia is the world's 45th-most populous country. 　The southernmost point of continental Eurasia is in Tanjung Piai. 　Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to numerous endemic species. 　Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms, which, from the 18th century on, became subject to the British Empire, along with the British Straits Settlements protectorate. 　During World War Two, British Malaya, along with other nearby British and American colonies, was occupied by the Empire of Japan. 　Following three years of occupation, peninsular Malaysia was unified as the Malayan Union in 1946 and then restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948. 　The country achieved independence on 31 August 1957. 　The independent Malaya united with the then British crown colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. 　In August 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation and became a separate independent country. 　The country is multiethnic and multicultural, which has a significant effect on its politics. 　About half the population is ethnically Malay, with minorities of Chinese, Indians, and indigenous peoples. 　The country's official language is Malaysian Malay, a standard form of the Malay language. 　English remains an active second language. 　While recognising Islam as the country's established religion, the constitution grants freedom of religion to non-Muslims. 　The government is modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, and the legal system is based on common law. 　The head of state is an elected monarch, chosen from among the nine state sultans every five years. 　The head of government is the Prime Minister. 　After independence, the Malaysian GDP grew at an average rate of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years. 　The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources but is expanding in the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and medical tourism. 　Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked third-largest in Southeast Asia and 36th-largest in the world. 　It is a founding member of ASEAN, EAS, and OIC and a member of APEC, the Commonwealth, and the Non-Aligned Movement.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth>Wealth</a> 
<font size=3>
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions. 　This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word weal, which is from an Indo-European word stem. 　The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. 　An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy. 　Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts). 　At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "the total of anything of value" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. 　Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts. 　Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own. 　A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy. 　The United Nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets. 　Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals. 　Human capital is the population's education and skills. 　Physical (or "manufactured") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit>Summit</a> 
<font size=3>
A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. 　The topographic terms acme, apex, peak (mountain peak), and zenith are synonymous. 　The term top (mountain top) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. 　For example, a big, massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. 　Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered subsummits (or subpeaks) of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. 　A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top. 　Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route. 　The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) above sea level. 　The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. 　They reached the mountain's peak in 1953. 　Whether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. 　The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres (98 ft) or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres (980 ft). 　Otherwise, it's a subpeak. 　In many parts of the Western United States, the term summit can also be used for the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad, more commonly referred to as a pass. 　For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit. 　This can lead to confusion as to whether a labeled "summit" is a pass or a peak.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser>Laser</a> 
<font size=3>
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. 　The term is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. 　The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. 　A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light that is coherent. 　Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. 　Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar (light detection and ranging). 　Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum. 　Alternatively, temporal coherence can be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond. 　Lasers are used in optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic, and free-space optical communication, semiconducting chip manufacturing (photolithography), laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment. 　Semiconductor lasers in the blue to near-UV have also been used in place of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to excite fluorescence as a white light source. 　This permits a much smaller emitting area due to the much greater radiance of a laser and avoids the droop suffered by LEDs; such devices are already used in some car headlamps.

<font size=3>
Montreal (/ˌmʌntriˈɔːl/ (listen) MUN-tree-AWL; French: Montréal [mɔ̃ʁeal] (listen)) is the second most populous city in Canada and most populous city in the Canadian province of Quebec. 　Founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or "City of Mary", it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill around which the early city of Ville-Marie is built. 　The city is centred on the Island of Montreal, which obtained its name from the same origin as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. 　The city is 196 km (122 mi) east of the national capital Ottawa, and 258 km (160 mi) southwest of the provincial capital, Quebec City. 　As of 2021,[update] the city had a population of 1,762,949, and a metropolitan population of 4,291,732, making it the second-largest city, and second-largest metropolitan area in Canada. 　French is the city's official language. 　In 2021, it was spoken at home by 59.1% of the population and 69.2% in the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area. 　Overall, 85.7% of the population of the city of Montreal considered themselves fluent in French while 90.2% could speak it in the metropolitan area. 　Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada, with 58.5% of the population able to speak both English and French. 　Historically the commercial capital of Canada, Montreal was surpassed in population and in economic strength by Toronto in the 1970s. 　It remains an important centre of commerce, aerospace, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, education, art, culture, tourism, food, fashion, video game development, film, and world affairs. 　Montreal is the location of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and was named a UNESCO City of Design in 2006. 　In 2017, Montreal was ranked the 12th-most liveable city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit in its annual Global Liveability Ranking, although it slipped to rank 40 in the 2021 index, primarily due to stress on the healthcare system from the COVID-19 pandemic. 　It is regularly ranked as a top ten city in the world to be a university student in the QS World University Rankings. 　Montreal has hosted multiple international conferences and events, including the 1967 International and Universal Exposition and the 1976 Summer Olympics. 　It is the only Canadian city to have held the Summer Olympics. 　In 2018, Montreal was ranked as a global city. 　The city hosts the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One; the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the largest jazz festival in the world; the Just for Laughs festival, the largest comedy festival in the world; and Les Francos de Montréal, the largest French-language music festival in the world. 　It is also home to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, who have won the Stanley Cup more times than any other team.

Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction involving magical elements, typically set in a fictional universe and sometimes inspired by mythology and folklore. 　Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became fantasy literature and drama. 　From the twentieth century, it has expanded further into various media, including film, television, graphic novels, manga, animations and video games. 　Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the respective absence of scientific or macabre themes, although these genres overlap. 　In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings that emulate Earth, but with a sense of otherness. 　In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield>Shield</a> 
<font size=3>
A shield is a piece of personal armour held in the hand, which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. 　Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, whether from close-ranged weaponry or projectiles such as arrows, by means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat. 　Shields vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from large panels that protect the user's whole body to small models (such as the buckler) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use. 　Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of spears and crossbow bolts, others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes (like the roromaraugi or qauata). 　Finally, shields vary greatly in shape, ranging in roundness to angularity, proportional length and width, symmetry and edge pattern; different shapes provide more optimal protection for infantry or cavalry, enhance portability, provide secondary uses such as ship protection or as a weapon and so on. 　In prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilisations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or wicker. 　In classical antiquity, the Barbarian Invasions and the Middle Ages, they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. 　They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry. 　Depending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial or scalloped. 　Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eye-hole, to look through when used with combat. 　The shield was held by a central grip or by straps with some going over or around the user's arm and one or more being held by the hand. 　Often shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. 　These designs developed into systematized heraldic devices during the High Middle Ages for purposes of battlefield identification. 　Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. 　In the 18th century, for example, Scottish Highland fighters liked to wield small shields known as targes, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as Zulu warriors) employed them when waging war. 　In the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking.

A shield is a large area of exposed Precambrian crystalline igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that form tectonically stable areas. 　These rocks are older than 570 million years and sometimes date back to around 2 to 3.5 billion years.　[citation needed] They have been little affected by tectonic events following the end of the Precambrian, and are relatively flat regions where mountain building, faulting, and other tectonic processes are minor, compared with the activity at their margins and between tectonic plates. 　Shields occur on all continents.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta>Atlanta</a> 
<font size=3>
Atlanta (/ætˈlæntə/ at-LAN-tə) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Georgia. 　It is the seat of Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, although a portion of the city extends into neighboring DeKalb county. 　With a population of 498,715 living within the city limits, it is the eighth most populous city in the Southeast and 38th most populous city in the United States according to the 2020 U.S. census. 　It is the core of the much larger Atlanta metropolitan area, which is home to more than 6.1 million people, making it the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. 　Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, it features unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the most dense urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States. 　Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth. 　The largest was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name "Atlanta" is derived, signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of transportation. 　During the American Civil War, it served a strategically important role for the Confederacy until it was captured in 1864. 　The city was almost entirely burnt to the ground during General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. 　However, the city rebounded dramatically in the post-war period and quickly became a national industrial center and the unofficial capital of the "New South". 　After World War II, it also became a manufacturing and technology hub. 　During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals becoming prominent figures in the movement's leadership. 　In the modern era, Atlanta has stayed true to its reputation as a major center of transportation, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998 (a position it has held every year since, with the exception of 2020 as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). 　With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $406 billion, Atlanta has the tenth largest economy of cities in the U.S. and the 20th largest in the world. 　Its economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors in industries including transportation, aerospace, logistics, healthcare, news and media operations, film and television production, information technology, finance, and biomedical research and public policy. 　The gentrification of some its neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline. 　This has altered its demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald>Donald</a> 
<font size=3>
Donald is a masculine given name derived from the Gaelic name Dòmhnall. 　This comes from the Proto-Celtic *Dumno-ualos ("world-ruler" or "world-wielder"). 　The final -d in Donald is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers, and partly associated with the spelling of similar-sounding Germanic names, such as Ronald. 　A short form of Donald is Don. 　Pet forms of Donald include Donnie and Donny. 　The feminine given name Donella is derived from Donald. 　Donald has cognates in other Celtic languages: Modern Irish Dónal (anglicised as Donal and Donall); Scottish Gaelic Dòmhnall, Domhnull and Dòmhnull; Welsh Dyfnwal and Cumbric Dumnagual. 　Although the feminine given name Donna is sometimes used as a feminine form of Donald, the names are not etymologically related.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness>Witness</a> 
<font size=3>
In law, a witness is someone who has knowledge about a matter, whether they have sensed it or are testifying on another witnesses' behalf. 　In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what they know or claim to know. 　In law a witness might be compelled to provide testimony in court, before a grand jury, before an administrative tribunal, before a deposition officer, or in a variety of other legal proceedings. 　A subpoena is a legal document that commands a person to appear at a proceeding. 　It is used to compel the testimony of a witness in a trial. 　Usually, it can be issued by a judge or by the lawyer representing the plaintiff or the defendant in a civil trial or by the prosecutor or the defense attorney in a criminal proceeding, or by a government agency. 　In many jurisdictions, it is compulsory to comply with the subpoena and either take an oath or solemnly affirm to testify truthfully under penalty of perjury. 　Although informally a witness includes whoever perceived the event, in law, a witness is different from an informant. 　A confidential informant is someone who claimed to have witnessed an event or have hearsay information, but whose identity is being withheld from at least one party (typically the criminal defendant). 　The information from the confidential informant may have been used by a police officer or other official acting as a hearsay witness to obtain a search warrant.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride>Pride</a> 
<font size=3>
Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or "confidence and satisfaction in oneself". 　However, "pride" sometimes is used interchangeably with "conceit" or "arrogance" (among other words) with negative connotations. 　Oxford defines it as "the quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own importance." 　This may be related to one's own abilities or achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's country. 　Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of oneself", as opposed to false pride or narcissism. 　Similarly, St. Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence", and Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism manifests." 　Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others. 　Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status. 　Pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice, sometimes as proper or as a virtue. 　With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. 　With a negative connotation pride refers to a foolishly and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments, used synonymously with hubris. 　While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. 　In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. 　When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, the greatness of soul or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, vanity or vainglory. 　Other possible objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sexual identity (especially LGBT pride).　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). 　Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 　The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. 　Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. 　Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. 　Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. 　Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. 　Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. 　Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. 　There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. 　Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. 　Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. 　In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. 　Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)>Endemic (epidemiology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In epidemiology, an infection is said to be endemic in a specific population or populated place when that infection is constantly maintained at a baseline level without extra infections being brought into the group as a result of travel or similar means. 　An endemic disease always has a steady, predictable number of people getting sick, but that number can be high (hyperendemic) or low (hypoendemic), and the disease can be severe or mild. 　Also, a disease that is usually endemic can become epidemic. 　For example, chickenpox is endemic (steady state) in the United Kingdom, but malaria is not. 　Every year, there are a few cases of malaria reported in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable vector (mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles). 　Consequently, the number of people infected by malaria is too variable to be called endemic. 　However, the number of people who get chickenpox in the UK varies little from year to year, so chickenpox is considered endemic in the UK.
