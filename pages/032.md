Ma is a Sumerian word meaning "land" that in Sumerian mythology was also used to regard Primordial Land. 　There seems to be some loss in records as to the transition, but the same name Ma appears again later, also tied to the Earth, in Ma being referred to as "Mother of the mountain" - in this case, Kur (Mountain) the first dragon god. 　The underworld Kur is the void space between the primeval sea (Abzu) and the earth (Ma).

<font size=3>
Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. 　It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. 　Although people's attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences, most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. 　Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures and were supported in royal courts and developed into sophisticated forms, over time becoming available to all citizens. 　The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. 　Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. 　The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. 　This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. 　Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth. 　An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. 　The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. 　Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. 　Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. 　Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. 　Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days. 　Some entertainment, such as public executions, are now illegal in most countries. 　Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. 　In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. 　What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another. 　The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. 　This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime>Crime</a> 
<font size=3>
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. 　The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. 　The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. 　One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state ("a public wrong"). 　Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law. 　The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. 　What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each relevant jurisdiction. 　While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law nations no such comprehensive statute exists. 　The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. 　In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. 　If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, death. 　Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (mens rea). 　While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. 　Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia>Asia</a> 
<font size=3>
Asia (/ˈeɪʒə/ (listen), also UK: /ˈeɪʃə/) is a continent which is part of Eurasia. 　It is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population and shares the landmass of Afro-Eurasia with Europe and Africa. 　Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of Earth's total surface area. 　The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. 　Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined. 　In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. 　The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. 　It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. 　The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. 　A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe. 　China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. 　China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. 　The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. 　The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. 　Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. 　Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions. 　Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.　[citation needed] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. 　It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech>Speech</a> 
<font size=3>
Speech is a human vocal communication using language. 　Each language uses phonetic combinations of vowel and consonant sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as words in the lexicon of a language according to the syntactic constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. 　In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional speech acts, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use enunciation, intonation, degrees of loudness, tempo, and other non-representational or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization to convey meaning. 　In their speech, speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through accent), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychological states (emotions or moods), physico-psychological states (sobriety or drunkenness, normal consciousness and trance states), education or experience, and the like. 　Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people swear they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something. 　There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. 　People talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person. 　Solo speech can be used to memorize or to test one's memorization of things, and in prayer or in meditation (e.g., the use of a mantra). 　Researchers study many different aspects of speech: speech production and speech perception of the sounds used in a language, speech repetition, speech errors, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in children's enlargement of their vocabulary, and what different areas of the human brain, such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, underlie speech. 　Speech is the subject of study for linguistics, cognitive science, communication studies, psychology, computer science, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and acoustics. 　Speech compares with written language, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called diglossia. 　The evolutionary origins of speech are unknown and subject to much debate and speculation. 　While animals also communicate using vocalizations, and trained apes such as Washoe and Kanzi can use simple sign language, no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 　More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. 　Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. 　Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence.

Refused (also known as the Refused) is a Swedish hardcore punk band originating from Umeå and formed in 1991. 　Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzén, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandström, and bassist Magnus Flagge. 　Guitarist Jon Brännström was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. 　Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature and were for a time associated with the straight edge subculture. 　The band released their debut album This Just Might Be... the Truth in 1994. 　They followed this up with Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent (1996) and five EPs. 　In 1998, the band released The Shape of Punk to Come, which expanded their sound with jazz and electronic influences, but was initially poorly received commercially and critically. 　The group shortly after disbanded during their subsequent tour. 　Despite limited contemporary success, Refused were influential on the development of rock music in subsequent decades. 　In 2012, the band reformed and commenced a reunion tour, and later released further albums Freedom (2015) and War Music (2019).

<font size=3>
In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae. 　It contains the pharynx and larynx. 　An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs. 　The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. 　Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. 　The "throat" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces. 　It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body. 　Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat. 　It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube. 　The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs. 　The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach. 　Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue. 　The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat. 　The Jugulum is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast. 　The term Jugulum is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the Jugulum.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey>Hockey</a> 
<font size=3>
Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. 　While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal. 　There are many types of hockey. 　Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. 　In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey". 　In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 　Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead. 　The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. 　The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. 　The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. 　Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936. 　Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally referred to as hockey include Lacrosse, Hurling, Camogie and Shinty.

In sport, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. 　Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. 　A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. 　A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. 　A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial. 　Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. 　A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad.

Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 　Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. 　A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. 　Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. 　Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. 　Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. 　New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. 　Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. 　For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

<font size=3>
A township is a kind of human settlement or administrative subdivision, with its meaning varying in different countries. 　Although the term is occasionally associated with an urban area, that tends to be an exception to the rule. 　In Australia, Canada, Scotland and parts of the United States, the term refers to settlements too small or scattered to be considered urban.

<font size=3>
A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. 　It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. 　It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. 　In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion. 　Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. 　These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. 　Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs. 　They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. 　This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. 　Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. 　The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved. 　Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. 　This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. 　It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. 　The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. 　Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. 　The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal>Animal</a> 
<font size=3>
Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 　With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. 　Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. 　Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). 　They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. 　The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. 　Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. 　The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. 　Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. 　Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 　6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago. 　Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. 　Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. 　In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. 　In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. 　Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. 　Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. 　Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm>Storm</a> 
<font size=3>
A storm is any disturbed state of the natural environment or the atmosphere of an astronomical body.　[citation needed] It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather. 　Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear. 　Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through. 　Heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise, such as skiing and snowmobiling. 　The English word comes from Proto-Germanic *sturmaz meaning "noise, tumult". 　Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with the system of high pressure surrounding it. 　This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. 　Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine>Medicine</a> 
<font size=3>
Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. 　Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. 　Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. 　Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. 　For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. 　In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). 　For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. 　Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine, and are thus called alternative medicine. 　Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.
