## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland>Holland</a> 
<font size=3>
Holland is a geographical region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. 　From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the counts of Holland. 　By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic. 　The area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the capital city (Amsterdam), the home of Europe's largest port (Rotterdam), and the seat of government (The Hague). 　Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019, and a population density of 1203/km2. 　The name Holland has frequently been used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. 　This casual usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and is even employed by many Dutch themselves. 　However, some in the Netherlands (particularly those from regions outside Holland or the west) find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country. 　In January 2020, the Netherlands officially dropped its support of the word Holland for the whole country, which included a logo redesign that changed "Holland" to "NL".

<font size=3>
A cylinder (from Greek: κύλινδρος, romanized: kulindros, lit. 'roller', 'tumbler') has traditionally been a three-dimensional solid, one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes. 　In elementary geometry, it is considered a prism with a circle as its base. 　A cylinder may also be defined as an infinite curvilinear surface in various modern branches of geometry and topology. 　The shift in the basic meaning—solid versus surface (as in ball and sphere)—has created some ambiguity with terminology. 　The two concepts may be distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces. 　In the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the right circular cylinder.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization>Generalization</a> 
<font size=3>
Look up generalization in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A generalization is a form of abstraction whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. 　Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). 　As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation. 　Generalization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. 　The parts, which might be unrelated when left on their own, may be brought together as a group, hence belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them. 　However, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole—until a common relation is established among all parts. 　This does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization. 　The concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, and might sometimes have a more specific meaning in a specialized context (e.g. generalization in psychology, generalization in learning). 　In general, given two related concepts A and B, A is a "generalization" of B (equiv., B is a special case of A) if and only if both of the following hold: Every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A. There are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B. For example, the concept animal is a generalization of the concept bird, since every bird is an animal, but not all animals are birds (dogs, for instance). 　For more, see Specialisation (biology).

<font size=3>
Wellington (Māori: Te Whanganui-a-Tara [tɛ ˈɸaŋanʉi a taɾa] or Pōneke [pɔːnɛkɛ]) is the capital city of New Zealand. 　It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. 　Wellington is the third-largest city in New Zealand by metro area, and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region. 　It is the world's southernmost capital of a sovereign state. 　Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world's windiest city by average wind speed. 　Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century, with initial settlement by Māori iwi such as Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. 　The disruptions of the Musket Wars led to them being overwhelmed by northern iwi such as Te Āti Awa by the early 19th century. 　Wellington's current form was originally designed by Captain William Mein Smith, the first Surveyor General for Edward Wakefield's New Zealand Company, in 1840. 　The Wellington urban area, which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of 212,000 as of June 2022. 　The wider Wellington metropolitan area, including the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt, has a population of 434,900 as of June 2022. 　The city has served as New Zealand's capital since 1865, a status that is not defined in legislation, but established by convention; the New Zealand Government and Parliament, the Supreme Court and most of the public service are based in the city. 　Wellington's economy is primarily service-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, government, and the film industry. 　It is the centre of New Zealand's film and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation, with two public research universities. 　Wellington is one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. 　The city is chiefly served by Wellington International Airport in Rongotai, the country's second-busiest airport. 　Wellington's transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa, and ferries connect the city to the South Island. 　Often referred to as New Zealand's cultural capital, the culture of Wellington is a diverse and often youth-driven one which has wielded influence across Oceania. 　One of the world's most liveable cities, the 2021 Global Livability Ranking tied Wellington with Tokyo as fourth in the world. 　From 2017 to 2018, Deutsche Bank ranked it first in the world for both livability and non-pollution. 　Cultural precincts such as Cuba Street and Newtown are renowned for creative innovation, "op shops", historic character, and food. 　Wellington is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, being ranked 35th in the world by the Global Financial Centres Index for 2021. 　The global city has grown from a bustling Māori settlement, to a colonial outpost, and from there to an Australasian capital that has experienced a "remarkable creative resurgence".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra>Ultra</a> 
<font size=3>
Ultra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. 　Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence. 　The name arose because the intelligence obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used (Most Secret) and so was regarded as being Ultra Secret. 　Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence. 　The code name Boniface was used as a cover name for Ultra. 　In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans, British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy, Boniface, who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany. 　Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the human intelligence from the Boniface network. 　The U.S. used the codename Magic for its decrypts from Japanese sources, including the "Purple" cipher. 　Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine. 　Used properly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in practice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. 　The term "Ultra" has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts". 　However, Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used by the German High Command, and the Hagelin machine. 　Many observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies. 　Winston Churchill was reported to have told King George VI, when presenting to him Stewart Menzies (head of the Secret Intelligence Service and the person who controlled distribution of Ultra decrypts to the government): "It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!" 　F. W. Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end describing Ultra as having been "decisive" to Allied victory. 　Sir Harry Hinsley, Bletchley Park veteran and official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment of Ultra, saying that while the Allies would have won the war without it, "the war would have been something like two years longer, perhaps three years longer, possibly four years longer than it was." 　However, Hinsley and others have emphasized the difficulties of counterfactual history in attempting such conclusions, and some historians, such as Keegan, have said the shortening might have been as little as the three months it took the United States to deploy the atomic bomb. 　The existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war. 　Since the Ultra story was widely disseminated by Winterbotham in 1974, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. 　For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, "Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Enigma communications, General Bernard Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail." 　Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction. 　As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, "The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy."

A curse (also called an imprecation, malediction, execration, malison, anathema, or commination) is any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object. 　In particular, "curse" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic (usually black magic) or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. 　In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. 　To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called "removal" or "breaking", as the spell has to be dispelled, and often requires elaborate rituals or prayers.

<font size=3>
In geology, a rock's fabric describes the spatial and geometric configuration of all the elements that make it up. 　In sedimentary rocks, the fabric developed depends on the depositional environment and can provide information on current directions at the time of deposition. 　In structural geology, fabrics may provide information on both the orientation and magnitude of the strains that have affected a particular piece of deformed rock.

<font size=3>
A copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, display, and perform a creative work, usually for a limited time. 　The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. 　Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. 　A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States. 　Some jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. 　It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.　[better source needed] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution. 　Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". 　This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. 　Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent. 　Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. 　Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without a formal registration. 　When the copyright of a work expires, it enters the public domain.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial>Burial</a> 
<font size=3>
Burial, also known as interment or inhumation, is a method of final disposition whereby a dead body is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects. 　This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. 　A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition. 　Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.　[citation needed] Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. 　It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life. 　Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called "green burial"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can retard decomposition of the body. 　Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. 　Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance. 　The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. 　Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others "banish" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. 　Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. 　Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. 　However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. 　Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once. 　Alternatives to burial include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea and cryopreservation. 　Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. 　Humans are not the only species to bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees, elephants, and possibly dogs.

Coordinates: 33°50′N 35°50′E﻿ / ﻿33.833°N 35.833°E﻿ / 33.833; 35.833Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənɒn, -nən/ LEB-ə-non, -⁠nən; Arabic: لُبْنَان, romanized: lubnān, Lebanese Arabic pronunciation: [lɪbˈneːn]; French: Liban), officially the Republic of Lebanon (Arabic: الجمهورية اللبنانية) or the Lebanese Republic, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is located between Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus lies to its west across the Mediterranean Sea; its location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has contributed to its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious diversity. 　It is part of the Levant region of the Middle East. 　Lebanon is home to roughly five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi), making it the second smallest country in continental Asia. 　The official language of the state is Arabic, while French is also formally recognized; Lebanese Arabic is used alongside Modern Standard Arabic throughout the country. 　The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back to 5,000 BCE. 　From c. 　3200–539 BC, it was home to the flourishing Phoenician civilization before being annexed by various Near Eastern empires. 　In 64 BC, the Roman Empire conquered the region, and the region became a major center for Christianity under the Byzantine Empire. 　In the 7th century, the Muslim conquest of the Levant established caliphal rule. 　The 11th century saw the start of the Crusades and the establishment of Crusader States in the region only for it to be later reclaimed by the Ayyubids and Mamluks before being ceded to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. 　Under Sultan Abdulmejid I, the first Lebanese protostate took form in the 19th century as the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, created as a home for the Maronite Christians under the Tanzimat reforms. 　Following the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, the five Ottoman provinces constituting modern-day Lebanon came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, under which its French-ruled predecessor state of Greater Lebanon was established. 　Following the invasion and occupation of the French Third Republic by Nazi Germany during World War II, French rule over the region weakened. 　Upon gaining its independence from Free France in 1943, Lebanon established a unique confessionalist form of government, with the state's major religious sects being apportioned specific political powers. 　Lebanon initially was relatively stable. 　This stability was short-lived and was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of large-scale fighting in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) between various political and sectarian factions. 　During this period, Lebanon was also subjected to overlapping foreign military occupations by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000. 　Since the end of the war, there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure. 　Lebanon is a developing country, ranking 112th on the Human Development Index. 　It has been classified as an upper middle income state. 　However, the Lebanese liquidity crisis, corruption as well as recent events have precipitated the collapse of currency, political instability, widespread shortages, high unemployment and poverty. 　The World Bank defined the economic crisis in Lebanon as one of the worst in the world since the 19th century. 　Despite the country's small size, Lebanese culture is renowned both in the Middle East and globally, primarily powered by its extensive diaspora. 　Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations and is a member of the Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

<font size=3>
A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. 　If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually rather referred to as a multiple unit, motor coach, railcar or power car; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight. 　Traditionally, locomotives pulled trains from the front. 　However, push-pull operation has become common, where the train may have a locomotive (or locomotives) at the front, at the rear, or at each end. 　Most recently railroads have begun adopting DPU or distributed power. 　The front may have one or two locomotives followed by a mid-train locomotive that is controlled remotely from the lead unit.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity>Quantity</a> 
<font size=3>
Quantity or amount is a property that can exist as a multitude or magnitude, which illustrate discontinuity and continuity. 　Quantities can be compared in terms of "more", "less", or "equal", or by assigning a numerical value multiple of a unit of measurement. 　Mass, time, distance, heat, and angle are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties. 　Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. 　Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. 　Under the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd, and number; all which are cases of collective nouns. 　Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: matter, mass, energy, liquid, material—all cases of non-collective nouns. 　Along with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.
