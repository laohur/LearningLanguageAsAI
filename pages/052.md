Beta (UK: /ˈbiːtə/, US: /ˈbeɪtə/; uppercase Β, lowercase β, or cursive ϐ; Ancient Greek: βῆτα, romanized: bē̂ta or Greek: βήτα, romanized: víta) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet. 　In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 2. 　In Ancient Greek, beta represented the voiced bilabial plosive IPA: [b]. 　In Modern Greek, it represents the voiced labiodental fricative IPA: [v] while IPA: [b] in borrowed words is instead commonly transcribed as μπ. 　Letters that arose from beta include the Roman letter ⟨B⟩ and the Cyrillic letters ⟨Б⟩ and ⟨В⟩.

Legislation is the process or result of enrolling, enacting, or promulgating laws by a legislature, parliament, or analogous governing body. 　Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as "legislation" while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. 　Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare, or to restrict. 　It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act.

<font size=3>
Anthony or Antony is a masculine given name, derived from the Antonii, a gens (Roman family name) to which Mark Antony (Marcus Antonius) belonged. 　According to Plutarch, the Antonii gens were Heracleidae, being descendants of Anton, a son of Heracles. 　Anthony is an English name that is in use in many countries. 　It has been among the top 100 most popular male baby names in the United States since the late 19th century and has been among the top 100 male baby names between 1998 and 2018 in many countries including Canada, Australia, England, Ireland and Scotland. 　Equivalents include Antonio in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Maltese; Αντώνιος in Greek; António or Antônio in Portuguese; Antoni in Catalan, Polish, and Slovene; Anton in Dutch, Galician, German, Icelandic, Romanian, Russian, and Scandinavian languages; Antoine in French; Antal in Hungarian; and Antun or Ante in Croatian. 　The usual abbreviated form is Tony (sometimes "Tone", "Ant", "Anth" or "Anton"). 　Its use as a Christian name was due to the veneration of St. Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism, particularly in Egypt. 　Also significant was the later cult of St. Anthony of Padua. 　In the United States, it is the 43rd most popular male name as of 2021, according to the Social Security Administration. 　When the background is Italian, Nino or Toni, shortened from Antonino, are used. 　Its popularity in the United Kingdom peaked during the 1940s; in 1944 it was the sixth most popular male name and was still as high as 14th in 1964.

<font size=3>
A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. 　In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. 　The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. 　The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification. 　The word crystal derives from the Ancient Greek word κρύσταλλος (krustallos), meaning both "ice" and "rock crystal", from κρύος (kruos), "icy cold, frost". 　Examples of large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt. 　Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. 　Polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. 　A third category of solids is amorphous solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. 　Examples of amorphous solids include glass, wax, and many plastics. 　Despite the name, lead crystal, crystal glass, and related products are not crystals, but rather types of glass, i.e. amorphous solids. 　Crystals, or crystalline solids, are often used in pseudoscientific practices such as crystal therapy, and, along with gemstones, are sometimes associated with spellwork in Wiccan beliefs and related religious movements.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition>Definition</a> 
<font size=3>
A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). 　Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). 　Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. 　A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. 　In mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not. 　Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.

<font size=3>
A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. 　Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. 　Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for preparation of food, hunting, manufacture of weapons, and working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts. 　The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. 　Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools. 　The introduction of widespread automation in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor. 　By extension, concepts which support systematic or investigative thought are often referred to as "tools" or as "toolkits".

<font size=3>
James Green aka "Sudden" is a fictional character created by an English author Oliver Strange in the early 1930s as the hero of a series, originally published by George Newnes Books Ltd, set in the American Wild West era. 　Oliver Strange died in 1952, and the series was revived by Frederick H. Christian in the 1960s. 　Christian classified the books as "Piccadilly westerns", that is books written by English authors, simply drawing on the conventions the genre, with no first hand experience of America. 　The Sudden books are among the earliest and best-loved of the type. 　Sudden is portrayed as an intrepid and accurate gunfighter in search of two men who cheated his foster father. 　James Green earns the nickname "Sudden" because of his lightning speed with a gun. 　Sudden is portrayed as a stereotypical gunfighter: an intelligent and resourceful drifting cowboy who is respectful of the law, unwilling to use a gun unless absolutely necessary, humanitarian, brave, strong, and fair. 　The first book was published in 1930 and was followed by 10 more until the 1940s and featured vivid descriptions of the western American landscape, rare in an author at that time. 　The series became popular for its exciting narrations combining elements of mystery, suspense, and action, with engaging characters, in a Wild West setting of dusty towns, ranches, and saloons.

<font size=3>
A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. 　Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. 　Often, computers are used to execute the simulation. 　Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. 　Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. 　Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. 　Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist. 　Key issues in modeling and simulation include the acquisition of valid sources of information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviors used to build the model, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the model, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. 　Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of computer simulation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation>Correlation</a> 
<font size=3>
In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. 　Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. 　Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the height of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase, as it is depicted in the so-called demand curve. 　Correlations are useful because they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice. 　For example, an electrical utility may produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather. 　In this example, there is a causal relationship, because extreme weather causes people to use more electricity for heating or cooling. 　However, in general, the presence of a correlation is not sufficient to infer the presence of a causal relationship (i.e., correlation does not imply causation). 　Formally, random variables are dependent if they do not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence. 　In informal parlance, correlation is synonymous with dependence. 　However, when used in a technical sense, correlation refers to any of several specific types of mathematical operations between the tested variables and their respective expected values. 　Essentially, correlation is the measure of how two or more variables are related to one another. 　There are several correlation coefficients, often denoted ρ {\displaystyle \rho } or r {\displaystyle r} , measuring the degree of correlation. 　The most common of these is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other). 　Other correlation coefficients – such as Spearman's rank correlation – have been developed to be more robust than Pearson's, that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships. 　Mutual information can also be applied to measure dependence between two variables.

A commissioner (commonly abbreviated as Comm'r) is, in principle, a member of a commission or an individual who has been given a commission (official charge or authority to do something). 　In practice, the title of commissioner has evolved to include a variety of senior officials, often sitting on a specific commission. 　In particular, the commissioner frequently refers to senior police or government officials. 　A high commissioner is equivalent to an ambassador, originally between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and now between all Commonwealth states, whether Commonwealth realms, republics or countries having a monarch other than that of the realms. 　The title is sometimes given to senior officials in the private sector; for instance, many North American sports leagues. 　There is some confusion between commissioners and commissaries because other European languages use the same word for both. 　Therefore titles such as commissaire in French, Kommissar in German and comisario in Spanish or commissario in Italian, can mean either commissioner or commissary in English, depending on the context.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard>Howard</a> 
<font size=3>
Howard is an English-language given name originating from Old French Huard (or Houard) from a Germanic source similar to Old High German *Hugihard "heart-brave", or *Hoh-ward, literally "high defender; chief guardian". 　It is also probably in some cases a confusion with the Old Norse cognate Haward (Hávarðr), which means "high guard" and as a surname also with the unrelated Hayward. 　In some rare cases it is from the Old English eowu hierde "ewe herd". 　In Anglo-Norman the French digram -ou- was often rendered as -ow- such as tour → tower, flour (western variant form of fleur) → flower, etc. (with svarabakhti). 　A diminutive is "Howie" and its shortened form is "Ward" (most common in the 19th century). 　Between 1900 and 1960, Howard ranked in the U.S. Top 200; between 1960 and 1990, it ranked in the U.S. Top 400; between 1990 and 2004, it ranked in the U.S. Top 600. 　People with the given name Howard or its variants include:

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete>Concrete</a> 
<font size=3>
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. 　Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. 　Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.　[citation needed] Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $600 billion in revenue by 2025. 　This widespread use results in a number of environmental impacts. 　Most notably, the production process for cement produces large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to net 8% of global emissions. 　Other environmental concerns include widespread illegal sand mining, impacts on the surrounding environment such as increased surface runoff or urban heat island effect, and potential public health implications from toxic ingredients. 　Significant research and development is being done to try to reduce the emissions or make concrete a source of carbon sequestration, and increase recycled and secondary raw materials content into the mix to achieve a circular economy. 　Concrete is expected to be a key material for structures resilient to climate disasters, as well as a solution to mitigate the pollution of other industries, capturing wastes such as coal fly ash or bauxite tailings and residue. 　When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. 　The cement reacts with the water through a process called concrete hydration that hardens over several hours to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses. 　This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms, but also to have a variety of tooled processes preformed. 　The hydration process is exothermic, which means ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set. 　Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, or otherwise change the finished material. 　Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as rebar) embedded to provide tensile strength, yielding reinforced concrete. 　In the past, lime based cement binders, such as lime putty, were often used but sometimes with other hydraulic cements, (water resistant) such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (named for its visual resemblance to Portland stone). 　Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist with other methods of binding aggregate together, including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces, and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder. 　Concrete is distinct from mortar. 　Whereas concrete is itself a building material, mortar is a bonding agent that typically holds bricks, tiles and other masonry units together.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore>Singapore</a> 
<font size=3>
Singapore (/ˈsɪŋ(ɡ)əpɔːr/ (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. 　It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. 　The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. 　It has the third highest population density in the world. 　With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. 　English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only in English. 　Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. 　Singapore's history dates back at least a millennium, having been a maritime emporium known as Temasek and subsequently as a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. 　Its contemporary era began in 1819 when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrepôt trading post of the British Empire. 　In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. 　During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942, and returned to British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. 　Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and in 1963 became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. 　Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian "Malaysian Malaysia" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia—at the perceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of Ketuanan Melayu—eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965. 　After early years of turbulence whilst lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalisation, integrating itself within the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign-exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. 　A highly developed country, it is tied at 12th on the UN Human Development Index and has the second-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. 　Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. 　It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub, and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. 　Singapore is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. 　Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world. 　Singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. 　Although the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. 　The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, with 83 out of 104 seats in Parliament as of the 2020 general election. 　One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. 　Singapore is also a member of the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), East Asia Summit (EAS), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the Commonwealth of Nations.

<font size=3>
Maryland (US: /ˈmɛrɪlənd/ (listen) MERR-il-ənd) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. 　It shares borders with Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. 　With a total land area of 12,407 square miles (32,130 km2), Maryland is the 8th smallest state by land area, but with a population of over 6,177,200, it ranks as the 18th most populous state and the 5th most densely populated. 　Baltimore is the largest city in the state, and the capital is Annapolis. 　Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. 　It is named after Henrietta Maria, the French-born queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, who was known then in England as Mary. 　Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans – mostly by Algonquian peoples and, to a lesser degree, Iroquoian and Siouan. 　As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of England, Maryland was founded by George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England. 　In 1632, Charles I of England granted Lord Baltimore a colonial charter, naming the colony after his wife, Henrietta Maria. 　Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans, who rejected Catholicism in their settlements, Lord Baltimore envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. 　Accordingly, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who "reproached" a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation. 　Nevertheless, religious strife was common in the early years, and Catholics remained a minority, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony. 　Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. 　Its economy was heavily plantation-based and centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. 　Demand for cheap labor from Maryland colonists led to the importation of numerous indentured servants and enslaved Africans. 　In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. 　Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution, and by 1776, its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence. 　Many of its citizens subsequently played key political and military roles in the war. 　In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. Although then a slave state, Maryland remained in the Union during the American Civil War, its strategic location giving it a significant role in the conflict. 　After the Civil War, Maryland took part in the Industrial Revolution, driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe. 　Since the 1940s, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. 　As of 2015[update], Maryland had the highest median household income of any state, owing in large part to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, retail services, public administration, real estate, higher education, information technology, defense contracting, health care, and biotechnology. 　Maryland is one of the most multicultural states in the country; it is one of the six states where non-Whites compose a majority of the population, with the fifth-highest percentage of African Americans, and high numbers of residents born in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and South and East Asia. 　The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the highest numbers of historic landmarks per capita. 　Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties, as well as the city of Baltimore, border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries, which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline. 　Although one of the smallest states in the U.S., it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature. 　In a similar vein, Maryland's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 61°N 8°E﻿ / ﻿61°N 8°E﻿ / 61; 8 Norway, officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe, the mainland territory of which comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. 　The remote Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard also form part of Norway. 　Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic, is a dependency of Norway; it also lays claims to the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land. 　The capital and largest city in Norway is Oslo. 　Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and had a population of 5,425,270 in January 2022. 　The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden at a length of 1,619 km (1,006 mi). 　It is bordered by Finland and Russia to the northeast and the Skagerrak strait to the south, on the other side of which are Denmark and the United Kingdom. 　Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. 　The maritime influence dominates Norway's climate, with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts; the interior, while colder, is also significantly milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. 　Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. 　The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country. 　Harald V of the House of Glücksburg is the current King of Norway. 　Jonas Gahr Støre has been prime minister since 2021, replacing Erna Solberg. 　As a unitary sovereign state with a constitutional monarchy, Norway divides state power between the parliament, the cabinet and the supreme court, as determined by the 1814 constitution. 　The kingdom was established in 872 as a merger of many petty kingdoms and has existed continuously for 1,151 years. 　From 1537 to 1814, Norway was a part of the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, and, from 1814 to 1905, it was in a personal union with the Kingdom of Sweden. 　Norway was neutral during the First World War, and also in World War II until April 1940 when the country was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany until the end of the war. 　Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels: counties and municipalities. 　The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and the Finnmark Act. 　Norway maintains close ties with both the European Union and the United States. 　Norway is also a founding member of the United Nations, NATO, the European Free Trade Association, the Council of Europe, the Antarctic Treaty, and the Nordic Council; a member of the European Economic Area, the WTO, and the OECD; and a part of the Schengen Area. 　In addition, the Norwegian languages share mutual intelligibility with Danish and Swedish. 　Norway maintains the Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system, and its values are rooted in egalitarian ideals. 　The Norwegian state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors, having extensive reserves of petroleum, natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, and fresh water. 　The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). 　On a per-capita basis, Norway is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside of the Middle East. 　The country has the fourth-highest per-capita income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists. 　On the CIA's GDP (PPP) per capita list (2015 estimate) which includes autonomous territories and regions, Norway ranks as number eleven. 　It has the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, with a value of US$1 trillion. 　Norway has the second highest Human Development Index ranking in the world, previously holding the top position between 2001 and 2006, and between 2009 and 2019; it also has the second highest inequality-adjusted ranking per 2021. 　Norway ranked first on the World Happiness Report for 2017 and currently ranks first on the OECD Better Life Index, the Index of Public Integrity, the Freedom Index, and the Democracy Index. 　Norway also has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. 　Although the majority of Norway's population is ethnic Norwegian, in the 21st century immigration has accounted for more than half of population growth; in 2021, the five largest minority groups in the country were the descendants of Polish, Lithuanian, Somali, Pakistani, and Swedish immigrants.
