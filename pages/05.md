## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produce>Produce</a> 

<font size=3>
Produce is a generalized term for many farm-produced crops, including fruits and vegetables (grains, oats, etc. are also sometimes considered produce). 　More specifically, the term produce often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were harvested.　[citation needed] In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept. 　Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets. 　The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries. 　In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes. 　These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop>Bishop</a> 

<font size=3>
A bishop is an ordained clergy member who is entrusted with a position of authority and oversight in a religious institution. 　In Christianity, bishops are normally responsible for the governance of dioceses. 　The role or office of bishop is called episcopacy. 　Organizationally, several Christian denominations utilize ecclesiastical structures that call for the position of bishops, while other denominations have dispensed with this office, seeing it as a symbol of power. 　Bishops have also exercised political authority. 　Traditionally, bishops claim apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles or Saint Paul. 　The bishops are by doctrine understood as those who possess the full priesthood given by Jesus Christ, and therefore may ordain other clergy, including other bishops. 　A person ordained as a deacon, priest (i.e. presbyter), and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ministerial priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the Body of Christ (the Church). 　Priests, deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry. 　Some Pentecostal and other Protestant denominations have bishops who oversee congregations, though they do not claim apostolic succession.

<font size=3>
A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. 　A judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. 　A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court. 　The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. 　In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. 　In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. 　The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection>Protection</a> 

<font size=3>
Protection is any measure taken to guard a thing against damage caused by outside forces. 　Protection can be provided to physical objects, including organisms, to systems, and to intangible things like civil and political rights. 　Although the mechanisms for providing protection vary widely, the basic meaning of the term remains the same. 　This is illustrated by an explanation found in a manual on electrical wiring: The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use. 　People protect themselves against personal or financial loss by means of insurance and from injury or discomfort by the use of protective clothing. 　They further protect their property by the installation of security measures such as locks and/or alarm systems. 　Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light. 　Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss. 　Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations. 　Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm. 　Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements. 　Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators. 　In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems. 　Humans seek to protect locations of historical and cultural significance through historic preservation efforts, and are also concerned with protecting the environment from damage caused by human activity, and with protecting the Earth as a whole from potentially harmful objects from space.

<font size=3>
A highway is any public or private road or other public way on land. 　It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks. 　In some areas of the United States, it is used as an equivalent term to controlled-access highway, or a translation for autobahn, autoroute, etc. 　According to Merriam Webster, the use of the term predates the 12th century. 　According to Etymonline, "high" is in the sense of "main". 　In North American and Australian English, major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways). 　Other roads may be designated "county highways" in the US and Ontario. 　These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway. 　In British English, "highway" is primarily a legal term. 　Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc. 　The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, highway patrol and highwayman.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida>Florida</a> 

<font size=3>
Florida is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico; Alabama to the northwest; Georgia to the north; the Bahamas and Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. 　It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　Spanning 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), Florida ranks 22nd in area among the 50 states, and with a population of over 21 million, it is the third-most populous. 　Florida's largest metro area is the Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, though its single largest city proper is Jacksonville. 　Florida's other large population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee. 　Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. 　In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). 　Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. 　Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and Great Britain before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. 　Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. 　The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868. 　Since the mid-20th century, Florida has experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. 　Its economy, with a gross state product (GSP) of $1.0 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation. 　Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of visitors annually. 　Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. 　The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. 　Florida has attracted or inspired writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway, and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, particularly in golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports. 　Florida was also heavily noted for being a battleground state in American presidential elections, particularly those in 2000, 2016, and 2020. 　About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　It has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier islands. 　Florida has 4,510 islands that are ten acres (4.0 hectares) or larger in area, the second highest number after Alaska. 　Much of the state is at or near sea level, and is characterized by sedimentary soil. 　Florida is the flattest state in the country, with the lowest high point of any U.S. state, at just 345 feet (105 meters). 　Florida's largest freshwater lake, Lake Okeechobee, is the second-largest located entirely within the contiguous 48 states and often referred to as an inland sea. 　Several beaches in Florida have turquoise and emerald-colored coastal waters. 　Florida's climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. 　It is the only state besides Hawaii to have a tropical climate, and is the only continental state with both a tropical climate (at the lower tip of the peninsula) and a coral reef. 　Consequently, Florida has several unique ecosystems, most notably Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the Americas. 　Unique wildlife include the American alligator, American crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther, bottlenose dolphin, and manatee. 　The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world after the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef.

A border divides two or more geographical boundaries, imposed either by features such as oceans and terrain, or by political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. 　Political borders can be established through warfare, colonization, or mutual agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation. 　Some borders—such as most states' internal administrative borders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area—are open and completely unguarded. 　Most external political borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints; adjacent border zones may also be controlled. 　Buffer zones may be set up on borders between belligerent entities to lower the risk of escalation. 　While border refers to the boundary itself, the area around the border is called the frontier.

<font size=3>
In biology and medicine, a host is a larger organism that harbours a smaller organism; whether a parasitic, a mutualistic, or a commensalist guest (symbiont). 　The guest is typically provided with nourishment and shelter. 　Examples include animals playing host to parasitic worms (e.g. nematodes), cells harbouring pathogenic (disease-causing) viruses, a bean plant hosting mutualistic (helpful) nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 　More specifically in botany, a host plant supplies food resources to micropredators, which have an evolutionarily stable relationship with their hosts similar to ectoparasitism. 　The host range is the collection of hosts that an organism can use as a partner.

In psychology and mental health, the host is the most prominent personality, state, or identity in someone who has dissociative identity disorder (DID) (formerly known as multiple personality disorder). 　The other personalities, besides the host, are known as alter personalities, or just "alters". 　The host may or may not be the original personality, which is the personality a person is born with. 　Additionally, the host may or may not be the personality that coincides with the official legal name of the person. 　Often this is thought to be the root of the person's psyche, or at least a key figure for completion of therapy, whether or not it has integration of the host and alters as a goal. 　There are arguments that a person can have multiple hosts.

Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, the Celtic Sea to the south west and the Bristol Channel to the south. 　It had a population in 2021 of 3,107,500 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi). 　Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit. 　The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. 　The capital and largest city is Cardiff. 　Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was formed as a kingdom under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. 　Wales is regarded as one of the Celtic nations. 　After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glyndŵr led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (Welsh: senedd). 　In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. 　Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. 　Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. 　Welsh national feeling grew over the century; a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. 　A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters. 　At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. 　Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys. 　The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. 　The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. 　Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism. 　Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency. 　The country has a distinct national and cultural identity and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the "land of song", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition and rousing choir singing. 　Both Welsh and English are official languages. 　A majority of the population in most areas speaks English whilst a majority of the population in parts of the north and west speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the whole country.

<font size=3>
Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. 　It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. 　Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.　[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. 　It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. 　Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber. 　Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. 　More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate. 　As of 2020, the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 557 billion cubic meters. 　As an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. 　In 2008, approximately 3.97 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. 　Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.

<font size=3>
A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. 　A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms a sign of disease. 　A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. 　The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these. 　The philosophical study of signs and symbols is called semiotics; this includes the study of semiosis, which is the way in which signs (in the semiotic sense) operate.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation>Nation</a> 

<font size=3>
A nation is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or society. 　A nation is thus the collective identity of a group of people understood as defined by those features. 　Some nations are equated with ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are equated with affiliation to a social and political constitution (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism). 　A nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. 　A nation has also been defined as a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity and particular interests. 　The consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed and historically contingent. 　Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism – the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state – did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century. 　There are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. 　Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. 　Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. 　Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible. 　Proponents of modernization theory describe nations as "imagined communities", a term coined by Benedict Anderson. 　A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. 　For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. 　Nationalism is consequently seen an "invented tradition" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. 　A nation's foundational "story" may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat>Heat</a> 

<font size=3>
In thermodynamics, heat is defined as the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across the boundary. 　A thermodynamic system does not contain heat. 　Nevertheless, the term is also often used to refer to the thermal energy contained in a system as a component of its internal energy and that is reflected in the temperature of the system. 　For both uses of the term, heat is a form of energy. 　An example of formal vs. informal usage may be obtained from the right-hand photo, in which the metal bar is "conducting heat" from its hot end to its cold end, but if the metal bar is considered a thermodynamic system, then the energy flowing within the metal bar is called internal energy, not heat. 　The hot metal bar is also transferring heat to its surroundings, a correct statement for both the strict and loose meanings of heat. 　Another example of informal usage is the term heat content, used despite the fact that physics defines heat as energy transfer. 　More accurately, it is thermal energy that is contained in the system or body, as it is stored in the microscopic degrees of freedom of the modes of vibration. 　Heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by a mechanism that involves the microscopic atomic modes of motion or the corresponding macroscopic properties. 　This descriptive characterization excludes the transfers of energy by thermodynamic work or mass transfer. 　Defined quantitatively, the heat involved in a process is the difference in internal energy between the final and initial states of a system, and subtracting the work done in the process. 　This is the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. 　The measurement of energy transferred as heat is called calorimetry, performed by measuring its effect on the states of interacting bodies. 　For example, heat can be measured by the amount of ice melted, or by change in temperature of a body in the surroundings of the system. 　In the International System of Units (SI) the unit of measurement for heat, as a form of energy, is the joule (J).

<font size=3>
Political "spring" is a term popularized in the late twentieth century to refer to any of a number of student protests, revolutionary political movements or revolutionary waves. 　It originated in the European Revolutions of 1848, which was sometimes referred to as the "Spring of Nations" or "Springtime of the Peoples". 　Prague Spring, a period of political liberalization of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1968 Croatian Spring, a 1971 movement for Croatian language rights and cultural identity in the second Yugoslavia Beijing Spring, a period of political liberalization in the People's Republic of China in the late 1970s Seoul Spring, a period of democratization in South Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s Rangoon Spring, sometimes used to describe the period leading up to the August 8, 1988 "8888" Uprising Kathmandu Spring, sometimes used to describe the 1990 People's Movement in Nepal, as well as subsequent democratic movements. 　Tehran Spring, sometimes used to describe the period in Iran during the 1997–2005 presidency of Mohammad Khatami Damascus Spring, period in Syria following the death of Hafez al-Assad in 2001 Cedar Spring was a chain of demonstrations in Lebanon (especially in the capital Beirut) triggered by the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005. 　Harare Spring, sometimes used to describe the period in Zimbabwe after the 2008 power sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai Arab Spring, another term for the Middle East—North Africa protest of 2010–2014 Riyadh Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests. 　The 2012 Quebec student protests movement is also called the 'Maple' Spring, from the French "Printemps Érable" which sounds phonetically similar to "Printemps Arabe" (Arab Spring). 　"Printemps Québécois" for "Quebec Spring" is also used. 　The 2012 Valencia student protests, also called Valencian Spring [es; ca]. 　In February 2012 the students of the Lluís Vives High school participated in several demonstrations to protest against the cutbacks in the educational budgets of the Valencian Autonomous Community. 　The police’s performance in those demonstrations was extremely controversial and appeared in many international media. 　This sparked the interest of Parents Associations and both Student and International organisations, such as Amnesty International and Save the Children. 　The documentary Spanish Teen Rally collect the testimony of Valencian Spring's students. 　Venezuelan Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2014 Venezuelan protests. 　Russian Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. 　Latin American spring, sometimes used to describe mass protest events that took place in Latin America between 2019 and 2022.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)>Spring (hydrology)</a> 

<font size=3>
A spring is a natural exit point at which groundwater emerges out of the aquifer and flows onto the top of the Earth's crust (pedosphere) to become surface water. 　It is a component of the hydrosphere as well as a part of the water cycle. 　Springs have long been important for humans as a source of fresh water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall. 　Springs are driven out onto the surface by various natural forces, such as gravity and hydrostatic pressure. 　A spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater is known as a hot spring. 　The yield of spring water varies widely from a volumetric flow rate of nearly zero to more than 14,000 litres per second (490 cu ft/s) for the biggest springs.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation>Generation</a> 

<font size=3>
A generation refers to all of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively. 　It can also be described as, "the average period, generally considered to be about 20–⁠30 years, during which children are born and grow up, become adults, and begin to have children." 　In kinship terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. 　It is known as biogenesis, reproduction, or procreation in the biological sciences. 　Generation is also often used synonymously with birth/age cohort in demographics, marketing, and social science; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time." 　Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. 　Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. 　Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.

<font size=3>
Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. 　It occurs after autumn and before spring. 　The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. 　Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. 　When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. 　In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. 　The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. 　The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 　The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. 　They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).

<font size=3>
In simple terms, risk is the possibility of something bad happening. 　Risk involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences. 　Many different definitions have been proposed. 　The international standard definition of risk for common understanding in different applications is “effect of uncertainty on objectives”. 　The understanding of risk, the methods of assessment and management, the descriptions of risk and even the definitions of risk differ in different practice areas (business, economics, environment, finance, information technology, health, insurance, safety, security etc). 　This article provides links to more detailed articles on these areas. 　The international standard for risk management, ISO 31000, provides principles and generic guidelines on managing risks faced by organizations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_(mythology)>Actor (mythology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Actor (Ancient Greek: Ἄκτωρ; gen.: Ἄκτoρος Aktoros) is a very common name in Greek mythology. 　Here is a selection of characters that share this name (which means 'leader', from the verb άγω: to lead or carry): Actor, father of Eurytus who was an ally of Phineus during his fight with Perseus. 　Actor, a king of Phthia, was said to be the son of King Myrmidon and Peisidice, daughter of Aeolus. 　Some say that Actor died childless, but others say that he is the father of Eurytion, his successor or of Irus, who was also called the father of Eurytion. 　According to Diodorus, Actor without an heir, was succeeded by Peleus who fled to his country from Aegina for killing his half-brother, Phocus. 　The hero was then purified by the king for his sins. 　This story was usually attributed to Actor's possible son Eurytion who was slain accidentally by his son-in-law Peleus. 　This Actor married Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus, and had several children, among them Menoetius. 　Menoetius was counted among the Argonauts, and was the father of Patroclus (Achilles' very close companion). 　Actor, son of King Deioneus of Phocis and Diomede, daughter of Xuthus, thus a brother of Asterodeia, Aenetus, Phylacus, and Cephalus. 　This Actor could be the man referred by Hesiod as the father of Protesilaus, one of the suitors of Helen of Troy. 　Actor, son of Azeus, descendant of Phrixus, was ruler of the Minyans of Orchomenus. 　He was father of Astyoche, who was seduced by the war-god Ares and bore him twin sons, named Ascalaphus and Ialmenus. 　These last two led the Minyan contingent to the Trojan War. 　Actor, son of Phorbas and Hyrmine, thus a brother of Augeas and Tiphys. 　He was king of Elis, and founded the city of Hyrmina, which he named after his mother. 　This Actor married Molione and became by her father of the twins known as the Molionides, Eurytus and Cteatus. 　Actor, the Epean son of Poseidon and Agamede, daughter of King Augeas. 　He was the brother of Belus and Dictys. 　Actor and Eurythemis were in one source called parents of Ancaeus (who other sources call the son of Lycurgus) and grandparents of Agapenor. 　Actor, the Achaean son of Hippasus from Pellene and one of the Argonauts. 　Actor, a Lapith. 　He was killed by the centaur Clanis. 　Actor, father of Sthenelus. 　Sthenelus followed Heracles in his campaign against the Amazons and was killed by them. 　Actor, son of Acastus, was accidentally killed by Peleus while hunting. 　As a retribution, Peleus sent to Acastus some cows and sheep that had been killed by a wolf sent by Thetis. 　Actor, son of Oenops, brother of Hyperbius. 　He was among the defenders of the Borraean Gate at Thebes when the Seven against Thebes attacked the city, and confronted Parthenopaeus at the gate. 　Actor, a warrior in the army of the Seven against Thebes. 　He saw a chasm open in the earth that swallowed Amphiaraus. 　Actor, an old Theban servant of Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus. 　During the war of the Seven against Thebes, he accompanied her to the walls when that army appeared in front of the barriers outside the city. 　Because of his age, Actor cannot follow the princess and he just stayed halfway up the climb to listen to her lament when she saw her brother in the enemy army. 　Actor, father of Echecles. 　His son married Polymele, mother of Eudoros by Hermes. 　Actor, a shepherd in Lemnos who befriended Philoctetes in Euripides' play Philoctetes. 　According to some accounts, he was instead the king of Lemnos whose shepherd named Iphimachus, son of Dolops, took care the abandoned hero after he was bitten by a snake. 　Actor, one of the companions of the exiled Aeneas. 　He is probably the same who in another passage is called an Auruncan, and of whose conquered lance Turnus made a boast. 　This story seems to have given rise to the proverbial saying "Actoris spolium" ("the spoil of Actor"), for any poor spoil in general. 　Actor, father of Actoris (though unnamed in the Odyssey) who was given by Icarius to his daughter Penelope after her wedding with Odysseus to serve as her personal handmaiden.

<font size=3>
An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a performance. 　The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. 　The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally "one who answers". 　The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. 　This can also be considered an "actor's role," which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. 　Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental performance art. 　Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. 　While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. 　The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe). 　After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England. 　In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball>Baseball</a> 

<font size=3>
Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. 　The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. 　The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 　The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. 　A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). 　The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. 　Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. 　The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. 　The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base. 　The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. 　One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. 　A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. 　Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. 　Baseball has no game clock. 　Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. 　This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. 　Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of "America's Pastime"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. 　In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 　In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. 　The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. 　The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. 　The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. 　Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.

A horse, in geology, is any block of rock completely separated from the surrounding rock either by mineral veins or fault planes. 　In mining, a horse is a block of country rock entirely encased within a mineral lode. 　In structural geology the term was first used to describe the thrust-bounded imbricates found within a thrust duplex. 　In later literature it has become a general term for any block entirely bounded by faults, whether the overall deformation type is contractional, extensional or strike-slip in nature.

<font size=3>
The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. 　It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. 　The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. 　Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. 　Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. 　These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. 　There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. 　Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. 　Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. 　Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. 　Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. 　They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. 　Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. 　There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. 　Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. 　Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. 　Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. 　Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing>Wing</a> 

<font size=3>
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid. 　Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils. 　A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. 　The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. 　A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift. 　Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils. 　Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics. 　Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>Flow (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. 　In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time. 　Flow is the melting together of action and consciousness; the state of finding a balance between a skill and how challenging that task is. 　It requires a high level of concentration, however; it should be effortless. 　Flow is used as a coping skill for stress and anxiety when productively pursuing a form of leisure that matches one's skill set. 　Named by the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy), though the concept has been claimed to have existed for thousands of years under other names.　[need quotation to verify] The flow state shares many characteristics with hyperfocus. 　However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. 　Some examples include spending "too much" time playing video games or becoming pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. 　In some cases, hyperfocus can "capture" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few. 　Hyperfocus is often mentioned "in the context of autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – conditions that have consequences on attentional abilities."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron>Iron</a> 

<font size=3>
Iron (/ˈaɪən/ or /ˈaɪərn/) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. 　It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. 　It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, just ahead of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. 　It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state, with its ores also being found there. 　Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) or higher, about 500 °C (932 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper. 　Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys—in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. 　That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. 　In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. 　The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound. 　Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. 　Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. 　Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. 　High-purity irons (e.g. electrolytic iron) are more resistant to corrosion. 　The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. 　These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. 　To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. 　Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. 　Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). 　Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. 　Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +7. 　Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.

<font size=3>
A tower is a tall structure, taller than it is wide, often by a significant factor. 　Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures. 　Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are built not to be habitable but to serve other functions using the height of the tower. 　For example, the height of a clock tower improves the visibility of the clock, and the height of a tower in a fortified building such as a castle increases the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes. 　Towers may also be built for observation, leisure, or telecommunication purposes. 　A tower can stand alone or be supported by adjacent buildings, or it may be a feature on top of a larger structure or building.

Please is a word used in the English language to indicate politeness and respect while making a request. 　Derived from shortening the phrase "if you please" or "if it please(s) you", the term has taken on substantial nuance based on its intonation and the relationship between the persons between whom it is used. 　In much of the Western world, use of the word is considered proper etiquette, and parents and authority figures often imprint upon children the importance of saying "please" when asking for something from an early age, leading to the description of the term as "the magic word".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom>Freedom</a> 

<font size=3>
Freedom is understood as either having the ability to act or change without constraint or to possess the power and resources to fulfill one's purposes unhindered. 　Freedom is often associated with liberty and autonomy in the sense of "giving oneself their own laws", and with having rights and the civil liberties with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. 　Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of choice, and freedom of speech. 　In one definition, something is "free" if it can change easily and is not constrained in its present state. 　In philosophy and religion, freedom is sometimes associated with free will, without undue or unjust constraints on that will, such as enslavement. 　It is an idea closely tied with the concept of negative liberty. 　Charles Taylor resolves one of the issues that separate "positive" and "negative" theories of freedom, as these were initially distinguished in Isaiah Berlin's seminal essay, "Two concepts of liberty". 　Taylor sees it as undeniable that there are two such families of conceptions of political freedom. 　Negative liberty is a concept that is often used in political philosophy. 　It is the idea that freedom means an ability to do what one wants, without external obstacles. 　This concept has been called too simplistic for discounting the importance of individual self-realization. 　Positive liberty is the ability to fulfill one's purposes.

<font size=3>
A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with several uses. 　It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. 　Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling. 　Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. 　Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. 　Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. 　The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame. 　Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials. 　As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word "ball" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects. 　"Ball" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, making a fist into a ball.

<font size=3>
Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. 　Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama. 　Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. 　Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. 　The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. 　Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera. 　Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: ὑπόκρισις, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach>Beach</a> 

<font size=3>
A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. 　The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. 　Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material. 　Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. 　Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. 　Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. 　However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. 　Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise. 　Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines. 　These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. 　To support these uses, some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. 　They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents. 　Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change. 　Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment. 　Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. 　Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. 　Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure.

<font size=3>
Corps (/kɔːr/; plural corps /kɔːrz/; from French corps, from the Latin corpus "body") is a term used for several different kinds of organization. 　A military innovation by Napoleon I, the formation was first named as such in 1805. 　The size of a corps varies greatly, but two to five divisions and anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000 are the numbers stated by the US Department of Defense. 　Within military terminology a corps may be: an operational formation, sometimes known as a field corps, which consists of two or more divisions, such as the Corps d'armée, later known as I Corps ("First Corps") of Napoleon I's Grande Armée); an administrative corps (or mustering) – that is a specialized branch of a military service (such as an artillery corps, a armoured corps, a medical corps, or a force of military police) or; in some cases, a distinct service within a national military (such as the United States Marine Corps). 　These usages often overlap. 　Corps may also be a generic term for a non-military organization, such as the US Peace Corps and European Solidarity Corps.

Coordinates: 40°N 4°W﻿ / ﻿40°N 4°W﻿ / 40; -4 Spain (Spanish: España, [esˈpaɲa] (listen)), or the Kingdom of Spain (Reino de España), is a country primarily located in southwestern Europe with parts of territory in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea. 　The largest part of Spain is situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its territory also includes the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in Africa. 　The country's mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar; to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France, Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. 　With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the second-largest country in the European Union (EU) and, with a population exceeding 47.4 million, the fourth-most populous EU member state. 　Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Bilbao. 　Anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 42,000 years ago. 　The ancient Iberian and Celtic tribes, along with other local pre-Roman peoples, dwelled the territory maintaining contacts with foreign Mediterranean cultures. 　The Roman conquest and colonization of the peninsula (Hispania) ensued, bringing the Romanization of the population. 　The fall of the Western Roman Empire ushered in the migration into Iberia of tribes from Central and Northern Europe with the Visigoths as the dominant power in the peninsula by the fifth century. 　In the early eighth century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, and during early Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power centered in Córdoba. 　Several Christian kingdoms emerged in Northern Iberia, chief among them León, Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre made an intermittent southward military expansion, known as Reconquista, repelling the Islamic rule in Iberia, which culminated with the Christian seizure of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. 　Jews and Muslims were forced to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion, and eventually the converts were expelled through different royal decrees. 　The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1479, often considered the formation of Spain as a country, was followed by the annexation of Navarre and the incorporation of Portugal during the Iberian Union. 　A major country of the Age of Discovery, Spain began the colonization of the New World in 1492 developing one of the largest empires in history and underpinned the emergence of a global trading system primarily fuelled by precious metals. 　Centralisation and further state-building in mainland Spain ensued in the 18th century with the Bourbon reforms. 　In the 19th century the Crown saw the independence of its American colonies as a result of cumulative crises and political divisions after the Peninsular War. 　Political instability reached its peak in the 20th century with the Spanish Civil War, giving rise to the Francoist dictatorship that lasted until 1975. 　With the restoration of democracy under the Constitution of Spain and the entry into the European Union, the country experienced profound economic, political and social change. 　The so-called Siglo de Oro was a period of flourishing in arts and literature in Spain, coinciding with the political rise of the Spanish Empire under the Catholic Monarchs and the Spanish Habsburgs. 　As such, Spanish art, music, literature and cuisine have been influential worldwide, particularly in Western Europe and the Americas. 　As a reflection of its large cultural wealth, Spain has one of the world's largest numbers of World Heritage Sites and is the world's second-most visited country. 　Its cultural influence extends over 570 million Hispanophones, making Spanish language the world's second-most spoken native language and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. 　Spain is a highly developed country, a secular parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with King Felipe VI as head of state. 　It is a high-income country and an advanced economy, with the world's sixteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the sixteenth-largest by PPP. 　Spain has the twelfth-highest life expectancy in the world. 　It ranks particularly high in healthcare quality, with its healthcare system considered to be one of the most efficient worldwide. 　It is a world leader in organ transplants and organ donation. 　Spain is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, the Eurozone, the Council of Europe (CoE), de facto member of the G20, the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the Union for the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and many other international organisations.

A candidate, or nominee, is the prospective recipient of an award or honor, or a person seeking or being considered for some kind of position; for example: to be elected to an office — in this case a candidate selection procedure occurs. 　to receive membership in a group "Nomination" is part of the process of selecting a candidate for either election to an office by a political party, or the bestowing of an honor or award. 　This person is called a "nominee", though nominee often is used interchangeably with "candidate". 　A presumptive nominee is a person or organization believes that the nomination is inevitable or likely. 　The act of being a candidate in a race for either a party nomination or for electoral office is called a "candidacy". 　Presumptive candidate may be used to describe someone who is predicted to be a formal candidate.

<font size=3>
Behavior (American English) or behaviour (British English) is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems or artificial entities in some environment. 　These systems can include other systems or organisms as well as the inanimate physical environment. 　It is the computed response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. 　Taking a behavior informatics perspective, a behavior consists of actor, operation, interactions, and their properties. 　This can be represented as a behavior vector.

<font size=3>
Sitting is a basic action and resting position in which the body weight is supported primarily by the bony ischial tuberosities with the buttocks in contact with the ground or a horizontal surface such as a chair seat, instead of by the lower limbs as in standing, squatting or kneeling. 　When sitting, the torso is more or less upright, although sometimes it can lean against other objects for a more relaxed posture. 　Sitting for much of the day may pose significant health risks, with one study suggesting people who sit regularly for prolonged periods may have higher mortality rates than those who do not. 　The average person sits down for 4.7 hours per day, according to a global review representing 47% of the global adult population. 　The form of kneeling where the buttocks sit back on the heels, for example as in the Seiza and Vajrasana postures, is also often interpreted as sitting.

A stadium (PL: stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event. 　Pausanias noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the stadion at Olympia, where the word "stadium" originated. 　Most of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for association football. 　Other popular stadium sports include gridiron football, baseball, cricket, the various codes of rugby, field lacrosse, bandy, and bullfighting. 　Many large sports venues are also used for concerts.

A safe (also called a strongbox or coffer) is a secure lockable box used for securing valuable objects against theft or fire. 　A safe is usually a hollow cuboid or cylinder, with one face being removable or hinged to form a door. 　The body and door may be cast from metal (such as steel) or formed out of plastic through blow molding. 　Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil thieves. 　One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around. 　A less secure version (only suitable for petty cash) is usually called a cash-box.

<font size=3>
A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones, ossicles, or other hard structures in the body which link an animal's skeletal system into a functional whole. 　They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. 　Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. 　Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. 　The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. 　Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_(geology)>Joint (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
A joint is a break (fracture) of natural origin in a layer or body of rock that lacks visible or measurable movement parallel to the surface (plane) of the fracture ("Mode 1" Fracture). 　Although joints can occur singly, they most frequently appear as joint sets and systems. 　A joint set is a family of parallel, evenly spaced joints that can be identified through mapping and analysis of their orientations, spacing, and physical properties. 　A joint system consists of two or more intersecting joint sets. 　The distinction between joints and faults hinges on the terms visible or measurable, a difference that depends on the scale of observation. 　Faults differ from joints in that they exhibit visible or measurable lateral movement between the opposite surfaces of the fracture ("Mode 2" and "Mode 3" Fractures). 　Thus a joint may be created by either strict movement of a rock layer or body perpendicular to the fracture or by varying degrees of lateral displacement parallel to the surface (plane) of the fracture that remains "invisible" at the scale of observation. 　Joints are among the most universal geologic structures, found in almost every exposure of rock. 　They vary greatly in appearance, dimensions, and arrangement, and occur in quite different tectonic environments. 　Often, the specific origin of the stresses that created certain joints and associated joint sets can be quite ambiguous, unclear, and sometimes controversial. 　The most prominent joints occur in the most well-consolidated, lithified, and highly competent rocks, such as sandstone, limestone, quartzite, and granite. 　Joints may be open fractures or filled by various materials. 　Joints infilled by precipitated minerals are called veins and joints filled by solidified magma are called dikes.

<font size=3>
A corporation is an organization—usually a group of people or a company—authorized by the state to act as a single entity (a legal entity recognized by private and public law "born out of statute"; a legal person in legal context) and recognized as such in law for certain purposes.　: 10  Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). 　Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. 　Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: by whether they can issue stock, or by whether they are formed to make a profit. 　Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as aggregate (the subject of this article) or sole (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person). 　One of the most attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability.　[clarification needed] Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. 　Limited liability in contract is uncontroversial because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. 　However, limited liability in tort remains controversial because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders. 　There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to excessive corporate risk taking and more harm by corporations to third parties. 　Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as stock corporations; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as stockholders or shareholders. 　Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as non-stock corporations; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a member of the corporation. 　Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as for-profit and not-for-profit corporations, respectively. 　There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are nearly always non-stock as well. 　A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. 　To simplify the explanation, whenever "stockholder" or "shareholder" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as "member" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation. 　Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment. 　Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. 　In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. 　Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. 　In American English, the word corporation is most often used to describe large business corporations. 　In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, the term company is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word corporation encompasses all incorporated entities. 　In American English, the word company can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity. 　Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. 　While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. 　In Germany, the organization was referred to as Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH. 　In the last quarter of the 20th century, this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the limited liability company or LLC. 　Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish>Parish</a> 

<font size=3>
A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations, constituting a division within a diocese. 　A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest, often termed a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. 　Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor. 　Its association with the parish church remains paramount. 　By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial entity but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it. 　In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume>Volume</a> 

<font size=3>
Volume is a measure of three-dimensional space. 　It is often quantified numerically using SI derived units (such as the cubic metre and litre) or by various imperial or US customary units (such as the gallon, quart, cubic inch). 　The definition of length (cubed) is interrelated with volume. 　The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. 　In ancient times, volume is measured using similar-shaped natural containers and later on, standardized containers. 　Some simple three-dimensional shapes can have their volume easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. 　Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. 　Zero-, one- and two-dimensional objects have no volume; in fourth and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison>Prison</a> 

<font size=3>
A prison, also known as a jail, gaol (dated, British English, Australian, South African and historically in Canada), penitentiary (American English and Canadian English), detention center (or detention centre outside the US), correction center, correctional facility, lock-up, hoosegow or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are confined against their will and usually denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as punishment for various crimes. 　Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. 　In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed. 　Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes. 　Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. 　In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps. 　In American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always strictly adhered to in casual speech. 　A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government. 　A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention) and is usually operated by a local government, typically the county sheriff. 　Outside of North America, prison and jail often have the same meaning.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 31°N 35°E﻿ / ﻿31°N 35°E﻿ / 31; 35 Israel (/ˈɪzri.əl, -reɪ-/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל Yīsrāʾēl [jisʁaˈʔel]; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل ʾIsrāʾīl), officially the State of Israel (מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל Medīnat Yīsrāʾēl [mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel]; دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل Dawlat Isrāʾīl), is a country in Western Asia. 　Situated between the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, it is bordered by Lebanon to the north, by Syria to the northeast, by Jordan to the east, by Egypt to the southwest, and by the Palestinian territories — the West Bank along the east and the Gaza Strip along the southwest — with which it shares legal boundaries. 　Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized internationally. 　The area of modern Israel and the West Bank is of great significance to the Abrahamic religions. 　In ancient history, it was where Canaanite and later Israelite civilizations emerged, while in the early first millennium BCE the kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged, before falling to the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires, respectively. 　During the classical era, the region was ruled by the Achaemenid, Macedonian, Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. 　In the 2nd century BCE, an independent Hasmonean kingdom emerged, before Rome conquered the area a century later. 　In the 7th century, the Muslim conquest of the Levant established caliphal rule. 　The First Crusade of the 11th century brought the founding of Crusader states, the last ending in the 13th century at the hands of the Mamluks, who lost the area to the Ottoman Empire at the onset of the 16th century. 　In late 19th century, Jews began immigrating to the area as part of the Zionist movement. 　Following World War I, the allied powers assigned the Mandate for Palestine to Britain, which during the war made a declaration of support for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. 　After World War II, the newly formed United Nations adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine, recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states, and placing Jerusalem under international control. 　Following a civil war within Mandatory Palestine between Yishuv and Palestinian Arab forces, Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948 at the termination of the British Mandate. 　A day later, several surrounding Arab countries intervened, leading to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements that saw Israel in control of most of the former mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. 　Over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled from or fled the territory Israel would come to control, with fewer than 150,000 Palestinian Arabs remaining within Israel. 　During and immediately after the war, around 260,000 Jews emigrated or fled from the Arab world to Israel. 　Israel has since fought wars with several Arab countries, and since the 1967 Six-Day War has occupied the Syrian Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip—the longest military occupation in modern history—though whether Gaza remains occupied following the Israeli disengagement is disputed. 　Israel has effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, though these actions have been rejected as illegal by the international community, and established settlements within the occupied territories, which are also considered illegal under international law. 　While Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and has normalized relations with a number of other Arab countries, it remains formally at war with Syria and Lebanon, and efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have thus far stalled. 　The country has a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and universal suffrage. 　The prime minister serves as head of government, while the Knesset is the unicameral legislature. 　An OECD member, Israel is a highly developed country with a very high standard of living, performing very high in measures of education, life expectancy, wealth per adult, happiness and per capita income. 　With a population of over nine million people, it has the world's 28th-largest economy by nominal GDP.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight>Weight</a> 

<font size=3>
In science and engineering, the weight of an object is the force acting on the object due to gravity. 　Some standard textbooks define weight as a vector quantity, the gravitational force acting on the object. 　Others define weight as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. 　Yet others define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that counteract the effects of gravity: the weight is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. 　Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. 　In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: ignoring air resistance, the famous apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, would be weightless. 　The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. 　For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. 　Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (e.g. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa). 　Further complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the theory of relativity according to which gravity is modeled as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. 　In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. 　The current situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in their various contexts.

A geological contact is a boundary which separates one rock body from another. 　A contact can be formed during deposition, by the intrusion of magma, or through faulting or other deformation of rock beds that brings distinct rock bodies into contact. 　The geologic subdiscipline of stratigraphy is primarily concerned with depositional contacts, while faults and shear zones are of particular interest in structural geology. 　Faults and shear zones can be regarded as a form of secondary structure in the rock beds.

The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. 　It includes the atmosphere and outer space. 　It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space. 　In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. 　This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. 　The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations. 　Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. 　An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night. 　In some cases, such as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere. 　The daytime sky appears blue because air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than longer ones (redder light). 　The night sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars. 　The Sun and sometimes the Moon are visible in the daytime sky unless obscured by clouds. 　At night, the Moon, planets, and stars are similarly visible in the sky. 　Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. 　Lightning and precipitation are also visible in the sky. 　Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites, can fly in the sky. 　Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities.

In mathematics, a path in a topological space X {\displaystyle X} is a continuous function from the closed unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} into X . 　{\displaystyle X.　} Paths play an important role in the fields of topology and mathematical analysis. 　For example, a topological space for which there exists a path connecting any two points is said to be path-connected. 　Any space may be broken up into path-connected components. 　The set of path-connected components of a space X {\displaystyle X} is often denoted π 0 ( X ) . 　{\displaystyle \pi _{0}(X).　} One can also define paths and loops in pointed spaces, which are important in homotopy theory. 　If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological space with basepoint x 0 , {\displaystyle x_{0},} then a path in X {\displaystyle X} is one whose initial point is x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} . 　Likewise, a loop in X {\displaystyle X} is one that is based at x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} .

<font size=3>
A newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background. 　Newspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns. 　Most newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue. 　The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. 　Newspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). 　However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely. 　Newspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for merchants. 　By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers. 　Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record. 　With the advent of the internet many newspapers are now digital, with their news presented online rather than in a physical format, with there now being a decline in sales for paper copies of newspapers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin>Latin</a> 

<font size=3>
Latin (lingua Latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna] or Latīnum, [laˈtiːnʊ̃]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. 　Latin was originally a dialect spoken in the lower Tiber area (then known as Latium) around present-day Rome, but through the power of the Roman Republic it became the dominant language in the Italian region and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire. 　Even after the fall of Western Rome, Latin remained the common language of international communication, science, scholarship and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when other regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage, and it eventually became a dead language in the modern linguistic definition. 　Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), six or seven noun cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect), three persons, three moods, two voices (passive and active), two or three aspects, and two numbers (singular and plural). 　The Latin alphabet is directly derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. 　By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardized into Classical Latin used by educated elites. 　Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken at that time among lower-class commoners and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights Plautus and Terence and author Petronius. 　Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century, and its various Vulgar Latin dialects developed in the 6th to 9th centuries into the modern Romance languages. 　Medieval Latin was used during the Middle Ages as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance, which then used Renaissance Latin. 　Later, New Latin evolved during the early modern era to eventually become various forms of rarely spoken Contemporary Latin, one of which, Ecclesiastical Latin, remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church at Vatican City. 　Latin has also greatly influenced the English language and historically contributed many words to the English lexicon after the Christianization of Anglo-Saxons and the Norman conquest. 　In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are still used in English descriptions of theology, science disciplines (especially anatomy and taxonomy), medicine, and law.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor>Emperor</a> 

<font size=3>
An emperor (from Latin: imperator, via Old French: empereor) is a monarch, and usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. 　Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (empress consort), mother (empress dowager), or a woman who rules in her own right and name (empress regnant). 　Emperors are generally recognized to be of the highest monarchic honor and rank, surpassing kings. 　In Europe, the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages, considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe. 　The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as "Emperor". 　Both emperors and kings are monarchs or sovereigns, but both emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. 　In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation. 　Therefore, a king might be obliged to pay tribute to another ruler, or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. 　However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts—the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the incorporation of India, though she was declared Empress of India. 　In Western Europe, the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the Holy Roman Emperor, whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of translatio imperii, i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the Western Roman Emperors, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. 　Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. 　Although technically an elective title, by the late 16th century the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria and following the Thirty Years' War their control over the states (outside the Habsburg monarchy, i.e. Austria, Bohemia and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. 　However, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of the French in 1804 and was shortly followed by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared himself Emperor of Austria in the same year. 　The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until Francis II abdicated that position in 1806. 　In Eastern Europe, the monarchs of Russia also used translatio imperii to wield imperial authority as successors to the Eastern Roman Empire. 　Their status was officially recognized by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. 　However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of Tsar even after Peter the Great adopted the title of Emperor of All Russia in 1721. 　Historians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. 　Such Pre-Roman titles as Great King or King of Kings, used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. 　Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the Athenian Empire of the late 5th century BC, the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenets and the Soviet and American "empires" of the Cold War era. 　However, such "empires" did not need to be headed by an "emperor". 　Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century. 　For purposes of protocol, emperors were once given precedence over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence among heads of state who are sovereigns—whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and, to a lesser degree, presidents—is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. 　Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. 　In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. 　Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.

<font size=3>
In social science, agency is the capacity of individuals to have the power and resources to fulfill their potential. 　For instance, structure consists of those factors of influence (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, ability, customs, etc.) that determine or limit agents and their decisions. 　The influences from structure and agency are debated—it is unclear to what extent a person's actions are constrained by social systems. 　One's agency is one's independent capability or ability to act on one's will. 　This ability is affected by the cognitive belief structure which one has formed through one's experiences, and the perceptions held by the society and the individual, of the structures and circumstances of the environment one is in and the position one is born into. 　Disagreement on the extent of one's agency often causes conflict between parties, e.g. parents and children.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(psychology)>Agency (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In psychology, agents are goal-directed entities that are able to monitor their environment to select and perform efficient means-ends actions that are available in a given situation to achieve an intended goal. 　Agency, therefore, implies the ability to perceive and to change the environment of the agent. 　Crucially, it also entails intentionality to represent the goal-state in the future, equifinal variability to be able to achieve the intended goal-state with different actions in different contexts, and rationality of actions in relation to their goal to produce the most efficient action available. 　Cognitive scientists and psychologists have thoroughly investigated agency attribution in humans and non-human animals, since social cognitive mechanisms such as communication, social learning, imitation, or theory of mind presuppose the ability to identify agents and differentiate them from inanimate, non-agentive objects. 　This ability has also been assumed to have a major effect on inferential and predictive processes of the observers of agents, because agentive entities are expected to perform autonomous behavior based on their current and previous knowledge and intentions. 　On the other hand, inanimate objects are supposed to react to external physical forces. 　Although the concepts are often confused with one another, sensitivity to agency and the sense of agency are distinct and separate concepts. 　The sensitivity to agency can be explained as a cognitive ability to identify agentive entities in the environment, while the sense of agency refers to the exertion of control over the environment and sometimes to self-efficacy, which is an individual's learned belief of how able they are to succeed in specific situations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept>Concept</a> 

<font size=3>
Concepts are defined as abstract ideas. 　They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of the concept behind principles, thoughts and beliefs. 　They play an important role in all aspects of cognition. 　As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. 　The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science. 　In contemporary philosophy, there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is: Concepts as mental representations, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects) Concepts as abilities, where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states) Concepts as Fregean senses, where concepts are abstract objects, as opposed to mental objects and mental states Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". 　Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. 　For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair". 　Concepts may be exact, or inexact. 　When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of tree, it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking. 　A concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas. 　Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. 　Concepts are regularly formalized in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence. 　Examples of specific high-level conceptual classes in these fields include classes, schema or categories. 　In informal use the word concept often just means any idea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software>Software</a> 

<font size=3>
Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. 　This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work. 　At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). 　Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. 　For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. 　An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. 　The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. 　As of 2023[update], most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past. 　The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. 　They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages. 　High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. 　Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

Architecture is the art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished from the skills associated with construction. 　It is both the process and the product of sketching, conceiving, planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures. 　The term comes from Latin architectura; from Ancient Greek ἀρχιτέκτων (arkhitéktōn) 'architect'; from ἀρχι- (arkhi-) 'chief', and τέκτων (téktōn) 'creator'. 　Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. 　Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. 　The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents. 　For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art. 　Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times. 　The earliest surviving text on architectural theories is the 1st century AD treatise De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, and beauty). 　Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found in their proportions. 　Giorgio Vasari wrote Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and put forward the idea of style in the Western arts in the 16th century. 　In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that "form follows function". 　"Function" began to replace the classical "utility" and was understood to include not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural dimensions. 　The idea of sustainable architecture was introduced in the late 20th century. 　Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to successful replication. 　Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. 　Indian and Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. 　In fact, During the European Middle Ages, pan-European styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects known by name. 　Later, the roles of architects and engineers became separated. 　Modern architecture began after World War I as an avant-garde movement that sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. 　Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures. 　Many architects became disillusioned with modernism which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and contemporary architecture developed. 　Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.

<font size=3>
Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing. 　From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. 　The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. 　Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. 　In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection. 　In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. 　This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting. 　In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation>Equation</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, an equation is a formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by connecting them with the equals sign =. 　The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English, any well-formed formula consisting of two expressions related with an equals sign is an equation. 　Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. 　The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. 　There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. 　An identity is true for all values of the variables. 　A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables. 　An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign ("="). 　The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" of the equation. 　Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. 　Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides. 　The most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials. 　The sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. 　For example, the equation A x 2 + B x + C − y = 0 {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0} has left-hand side A x 2 + B x + C − y {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y} , which has four terms, and right-hand side 0 {\displaystyle 0} , consisting of just one term. 　The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables). 　An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. 　When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. 　If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. 　More generally, an equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides. 　In Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. 　As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. 　This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics. 　Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. 　When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. 　To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. 　Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. 　The techniques used are different and come from number theory. 　These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions. 　Differential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. 　They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. 　Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. 　The "=" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal>Signal</a> 

<font size=3>
In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. 　Any quantity that can vary over space or time can be used as a signal to share messages between observers. 　The IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing includes audio, video, speech, image, sonar, and radar as examples of signal. 　A signal may also be defined as any observable change in a quantity over space or time (a time series), even if it does not carry information. 　In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms, ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food. 　Signaling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell signaling. 　Signaling theory, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for evolution is the ability of animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. 　In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. 　For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse. 　Another important property of a signal is its entropy or information content. 　Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content. 　The information of a signal is often accompanied by noise, which primarily refers to unwanted modifications of signals, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk). 　The reduction of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity. 　The separation of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances. 　Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have advanced the design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage, and manipulation of information. 　In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines: electronic engineering and computer engineering developed to specialize in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals, while design engineering developed to address the functional design of signals in user–machine interfaces.

<font size=3>
Sleep is a sedentary state of mind and body. 　It is characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and reduced interactions with surroundings. 　It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns. 　Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM sleep and non-REM sleep. 　Although REM stands for "rapid eye movement", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. 　Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. 　During sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. 　The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night. 　The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. 　Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years. 　Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. 　The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns. 　Common sources of artificial light include outdoor lighting and the screens of electronic devices such as smartphones and televisions, which emit large amounts of blue light, a form of light typically associated with daytime. 　This disrupts the release of the hormone melatonin needed to regulate the sleep-cycle.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution>Constitution</a> 

<font size=3>
A constitution is the aggregate of fundamental principles or established precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other type of entity and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed. 　When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are encompassed in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution. 　The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a notable example of an uncodified constitution; it is instead written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties. 　Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign countries to companies and unincorporated associations. 　A treaty which establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. 　Within states, a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. 　Some constitutions, especially codified constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross, such as fundamental rights. 　The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any country in the world, with 146,385 words in its English-language version, while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution with 3,814 words. 　The Constitution of San Marino might be the world's oldest active written constitution, since some of its core documents have been in operation since 1600, while the Constitution of the United States is the oldest active codified constitution. 　The historical life expectancy of a constitution since 1789 is approximately 19 years.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow>Yellow</a> 

<font size=3>
Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of light. 　It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575–585 nm. 　It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. 　In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. 　Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. 　They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases. 　Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet). 　Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old. 　Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas. 　In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics. 　In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. 　In China, bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet. 　According to surveys in Europe, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, happiness, and spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, greed, and, in the U.S., cowardice. 　In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. 　In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.

<font size=3>
Blocks in meteorology are large-scale patterns in the atmospheric pressure field that are nearly stationary, effectively "blocking" or redirecting migratory cyclones. 　They are also known as blocking highs or blocking anticyclones. 　These blocks can remain in place for several days or even weeks, causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for an extended period of time (e.g. precipitation for some areas, clear skies for others). 　In the Northern Hemisphere, extended blocking occurs most frequently in the spring over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. 　Whilst these events are linked to the occurrence of extreme weather events such as heat waves, particularly the onset and decay of these events is still not well captured in numerical weather forecasts and remains an open area of research.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20 Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. 　It is divided into 16 administrative provinces called voivodeships, covering an area of 312,696 km2 (120,733 sq mi). 　Poland has a population of 38 million and is the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union. 　Warsaw is the nation's capital and largest metropolis. 　Other major cities include Kraków, Wrocław, Łódź, Poznań, Gdańsk, and Szczecin. 　Poland has a temperate transitional climate and its territory traverses the Central European Plain, extending from Baltic Sea in the north to Sudeten and Carpathian Mountains in the south. 　The longest Polish river is the Vistula, and Poland's highest point is Mount Rysy, situated in the Tatra mountain range of the Carpathians. 　The country is bordered by Lithuania and Russia to the northeast, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west. 　It also shares maritime boundaries with Denmark and Sweden. 　The history of human activity on Polish soil dates to circa 10,000 BC. 　Culturally diverse throughout late antiquity, the region became inhabited by tribal Polans who gave Poland its name in the early medieval period. 　The establishment of statehood in 966 coincided with a pagan ruler of the Polans converting to Christianity under the auspices of the Roman Church. 　The Kingdom of Poland emerged in 1025 and in 1569 cemented its longstanding association with Lithuania, thus forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. 　It was one of the largest great powers of Europe at the time, with a uniquely liberal political system that adopted Europe's first modern constitution in 1791. 　With the passing of a prosperous Polish Golden Age, the country was partitioned by neighbouring states at the end of the 18th century and regained its independence in 1918 as the Second Polish Republic. 　In September 1939, the German-Soviet invasion of Poland marked the beginning of World War II, which resulted in the Holocaust and millions of Polish casualties. 　As a member of the Communist Bloc in the global Cold War, the Polish People's Republic was a founding signatory of the Warsaw Pact. 　Through the emergence and contributions of the Solidarity movement, the communist government was dissolved and Poland re-established itself as a democratic state in 1989. 　Poland is a parliamentary republic, with its bicameral legislature comprising the Sejm and the Senate. 　It is a developed market and a high income economy. 　Considered a middle power, Poland has the sixth largest economy in the European Union by GDP (nominal) and the fifth largest by GDP (PPP). 　It provides high standards of living, safety and economic freedom, as well as free university education and a universal health care system. 　The country has 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 15 of which are cultural. 　Poland is a founding member state of the United Nations, as well as a member of the World Trade Organization, NATO, and the European Union (including the Schengen Area).

In many countries, a mayor is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government such as that of a city or a town. 　Worldwide, there is a wide variance in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated. 　Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. 　A mayor's duties and responsibilities may be to appoint and oversee municipal managers and employees, provide basic governmental services to constituents, and execute the laws and ordinances passed by a municipal governing body (or mandated by a state, territorial or national governing body). 　Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board. 　The term mayor shares a linguistic origin with the military rank of Major, both ultimately derived from French majeur.

<font size=3>
Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to use concepts to model that object. 　Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. 　Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behavior. 　Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. 　However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behavior of an object, animal or system—and therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal, or system in their culture. 　They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognized standard concepts and theories of their culture. 　Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make inferences.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution>Evolution</a> 

<font size=3>
Evolution is the change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. 　These characteristics are the expressions of genes, which are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. 　Variation tends to exist within any given population as a result of genetic mutation and recombination. 　Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or more rare within a population. 　The evolutionary pressures that determine whether a characteristic is common or rare within a population constantly change, resulting in a change in heritable characteristics arising over successive generations. 　It is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules. 　The theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species. 　Evolution by natural selection is established by observable facts about living organisms: (1) more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive; (2) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation); (3) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness); and (4) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness). 　In successive generations, members of a population are therefore more likely to be replaced by the offspring of parents with favourable characteristics. 　In the early 20th century, other competing ideas of evolution such as mutationism and orthogenesis were refuted as the modern synthesis concluded Darwinian evolution acts on Mendelian genetic variation. 　All life on Earth—including humanity—shares a last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which lived approximately 3.5–3.8 billion years ago. 　The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite to microbial mat fossils to fossilised multicellular organisms. 　Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped by repeated formations of new species (speciation), changes within species (anagenesis), and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth. 　Morphological and biochemical traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and these traits can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. 　Evolutionary biologists have continued to study various aspects of evolution by forming and testing hypotheses as well as constructing theories based on evidence from the field or laboratory and on data generated by the methods of mathematical and theoretical biology. 　Their discoveries have influenced not just the development of biology but numerous other scientific and industrial fields, including agriculture, medicine, and computer science.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama>Drama</a> 

<font size=3>
Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television. 　Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory. 　The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "deed" or "act" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drâma), which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek: δράω, dráō). 　The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. 　In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game (translating the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre. 　The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era. 　"Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). 　It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe "drama" as a genre within their respective media. 　The term "radio drama" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance. 　It may also be used to refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio. 　The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. 　The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. 　Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. 　Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action". 　Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). 　Closet drama is a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed. 　In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish>Fish</a> 

<font size=3>
Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits. 　Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. 　Approximately 95% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those being teleosts. 　The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. 　Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. 　Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. 　Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. 　The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods. 　Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. 　Fish can acoustically communicate with each other, most often in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship. 　Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. 　They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean. 　With 34,300 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates. 　Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. 　Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (in aquaculture). 　They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. 　Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies. 　Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. 　However, traditionally fish (pisces or ichthyes) are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods, and are therefore not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods, although usually "vertebrate" is preferred and used for this purpose (fish plus tetrapods) instead. 　Furthermore, cetaceans, although mammals, have often been considered fish by various cultures and time periods.

<font size=3>
In geology, a platform is a continental area covered by relatively flat or gently tilted, mainly sedimentary strata, which overlie a basement of consolidated igneous or metamorphic rocks of an earlier deformation. 　Platforms, shields and the basement rocks together constitute cratons. 　Platform sediments can be classified into the following groups: a "protoplatform" of metamorphosed sediments at the bottom, a "quasiplatform" of slightly deformed sediments, a "cataplatform", and an "orthoplatform" at the top. 　The Mesoproterozoic Jotnian sediments of the Baltic area are examples of a "quasiplatform". 　The post-Ordovician rocks of the South American Platform are examples of an orthoplatform.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic>Traffic</a> 

<font size=3>
Traffic comprises pedestrians, vehicles, ridden or herded animals, trains, and other conveyances that use public ways (roads) for travel and transportation. 　Traffic laws govern and regulate traffic, while rules of the road include traffic laws and informal rules that may have developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic. 　Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, and traffic control at intersections. 　Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, or signs. 　Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. 　Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated. 　Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate. 　Organization typically produces a better combination of travel safety and efficiency. 　Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include road construction, collisions, and debris in the roadway. 　On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a phenomenon known as traffic waves. 　A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and gridlock. 　Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland>Scotland</a> 

<font size=3>
Scotland (Scots: Scotland, Scottish Gaelic: Alba [ˈal̪ˠapə] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　Covering the northern third of the island of Great Britain, mainland Scotland has a 96-mile (154-kilometre) border with England to the southeast and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the northeast and east, and the Irish Sea to the south. 　It also contains more than 790 islands, principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. 　Most of the population, including the capital Edinburgh, is concentrated in the Central Belt—the plain between the Scottish Highlands and the Southern Uplands—in the Scottish Lowlands. 　Scotland is divided into 32 administrative subdivisions or local authorities, known as council areas. 　Glasgow City is the largest council area in terms of population, with Highland being the largest in terms of area. 　Limited self-governing power, covering matters such as education, social services and roads and transportation, is devolved from the Scottish Government to each subdivision. 　Scotland is the second-largest country in the United Kingdom, and accounted for 8.3% of the population in 2012. 　The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the 9th century and continued to exist until 1707. 　By inheritance in 1603, James VI of Scotland became king of England and Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. 　Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. 　The union also created the Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. 　In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1922, the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being officially renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927). 　Within Scotland, the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. 　The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law. 　The continued existence of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 incorporating union with England. 　In 1999, a Scottish Parliament was re-established, in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members, having authority over many areas of domestic policy. 　The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland, who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland. 　Scotland is represented in the United Kingdom Parliament by 59 members of parliament (MPs). 　It is also a member of the British–Irish Council, sending five members of the Scottish Parliament to the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly, as well as being part of the Joint Ministerial Committee, represented by the first minister.
