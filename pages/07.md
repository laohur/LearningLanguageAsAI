<font size=3>
A drug is any chemical substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. 　Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. 　Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, suppository, or dissolution under the tongue. 　In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. 　A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. 　Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. 　Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders. 　Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes—groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), a related mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease. 　The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code, which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. 　Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. 　This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties. 　Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness. 　These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. 　These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world. 　The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. 　All drugs can have potential side effects. 　Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause addiction and/or physical dependence. 　Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis. 　Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.

<font size=3>
Driving is the controlled operation and movement of a vehicle, including cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses, and bicycles. 　Permission to drive on public highways is granted based on a set of conditions being met and drivers are required to follow the established road and traffic laws in the location they are driving. 　The word driving, has etymology dating back to the 15th century and has developed as what driving has encompassed has changed from working animals in the 15th to automobiles in the 1800s. 　Driving skills have also developed since the 15th century with physical, mental and safety skills being required to drive. 　This evolution of the skills required to drive have been accompanied by the introduction of driving laws which relate to not only the driver but the driveability of a car.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance>Importance</a> 

<font size=3>
Importance is a property of entities that matter or make a difference. 　For example, World War II was an important event and Albert Einstein was an important person because of how they affected the world. 　There are disagreements in the academic literature about what type of difference is required. 　According to the causal impact view, something is important if it has a big causal impact on the world. 　This view is rejected by various theorists, who insist that an additional aspect is required: that the impact in question makes a value difference. 　This is often understood in terms of how the important thing affects the well-being of people. 　So on this view, World War II was important, not just because it brought about many wide-ranging changes but because these changes had severe negative impacts on the well-being of the people involved. 　The difference in question is usually understood counterfactually as the contrast between how the world actually is and how the world would have been without the existence of the important entity. 　It is often argued that importance claims are context- or domain-dependent. 　This means that they either explicitly or implicitly assume a certain domain in relation to which something matters. 　For example, studying for an exam is important in the context of academic success but not in the context of world history. 　Importance comes in degrees: to be important usually means to matter more within the domain in question than most of the other entities within this domain. 　The term "importance" is often used in overlapping ways with various related terms, such as "meaningfulness", "value", and "caring". 　Theorists frequently try to elucidate these terms by comparing them to show what they have in common and how they differ. 　A meaningful life is usually also important in some sense. 　But meaningfulness has additional requirements: the life should be guided by the agent's intention and directed at realizing some form of higher purpose. 　In some contexts, to say that something is important means the same as saying that it is valuable. 　More generally, however, importance refers not to value itself but to a value difference. 　This difference may also be negative: some events are important because they have very bad consequences. 　Importance is often treated as an objective feature in contrast to the subjective attitude of caring about something or ascribing importance to it. 　Ideally, the two overlap: people subjectively care about things that are objectively important. 　Nonetheless, the two may come apart when people care about unimportant things or fail to care about important things. 　Some theorists distinguish between instrumental importance relative to a specific goal in contrast to a form of importance based on intrinsic or final value. 　A closely related distinction is between importance relative to someone and absolute or unrestricted importance. 　The concept of importance is central to numerous fields and issues. 　Many people desire to be important or to lead an important life. 　It has been argued that this is not always a good goal since it can also be realized in a negative way: by causing a lot of harm and thereby making an important but negative value difference. 　Common desires that are closely related include wanting power, wealth, and fame. 　In the realm of ethics, the importance of something often determines how one should act towards this thing, for example, by paying attention to it or by protecting it. 　In this regard, importance is a normative property, meaning that importance claims constitute reasons for actions, emotions, and other attitudes. 　On a psychological level, considerations of the relative importance of the aspects of a situation help the individual simplify its complexity by only focusing on its most significant features. 　A central discussion in the context of the meaning of life concerns the question of whether human life is important on the cosmic level. 　Nihilists and absurdists usually give a negative response to this question. 　This pessimistic outlook can in some cases cause an existential crisis. 　In the field of artificial intelligence, implementing artificial reasoning to assess the importance of information poses a significant challenge when trying to deal with the complexity of real-world situations.

<font size=3>
Berlin (/bɜːrˈlɪn/ bur-LIN, German: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. 　Its 3.7 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits. 　One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. 　Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr. 　The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions. 　Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. 　Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. 　Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. 　About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes. 　The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects. 　First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). 　Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. 　The Gründerzeitcode: deu promoted to code: de era's industrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population rapidly. 　Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population. 　After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of West Germany, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory. 　East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. 　Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany. 　Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science. 　Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues. 　Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. 　The metropolis is a popular tourist destination. 　Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech. 　Berlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT Berlin, Hertie School, and Bard College Berlin. 　Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. 　With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions. 　The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and a very high quality of life. 　Berlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Modernism Housing Estates. 　Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Berlin Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral, and Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany. 　Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events including Museum Island, the German Historical Museum, Jewish Museum, Natural History Museum, State Library, State Opera, Philharmonic, and the Berlin Marathon.

<font size=3>
Silence is the absence of ambient audible sound, the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication, whether through speech or other medium. 　Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. 　Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or as reactive tokens, for example, as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like. 　Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation.

<font size=3>
Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. 　The branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political science. 　It may be used positively in the context of a "political solution" which is compromising and nonviolent, or descriptively as "the art or science of government", but also often carries a negative connotation. 　The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or limitedly, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it. 　A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising internal and external force, including warfare against adversaries. 　Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level. 　In modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. 　Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders. 　An election is usually a competition between different parties. 　A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a society. 　The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, Confucius's political manuscripts and Chanakya's Arthashastra.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy>Comedy</a> 

<font size=3>
Comedy is a genre of fiction that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film, stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other entertainment medium. 　The term originated in ancient Greece: In Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by political satire performed by comic poets in theaters. 　The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. 　Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old". 　A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions posing obstacles to his hopes. 　In this struggle, the youth then becomes constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to resort to ruses which engender dramatic irony, which provokes laughter. 　Satire and political satire use comedy to portray people or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. 　Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them. 　Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy, which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and black comedy, which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature. 　Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways, which can often be taken as offensive by the subjects of said joke. 　A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. 　Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

Tears are a clear liquid secreted by the lacrimal glands (tear gland) found in the eyes of all land mammals. 　Tears are made up of water, electrolytes, proteins, lipids, and mucins that form layers on the surface of eyes. 　The different types of tears—basal, reflex, and emotional—vary significantly in composition. 　The functions of tears include lubricating the eyes (basal tears), removing irritants (reflex tears), and also aiding the immune system. 　Tears also occur as a part of the body's natural pain response. 　Emotional secretion of tears may serve a biological function by excreting stress-inducing hormones built up through times of emotional distress. 　Tears have symbolic significance among humans.

Massachusetts (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ (listen), /-zɪts/); Massachusett: Muhsachuweesut /məhswatʃəwiːsət/), officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It borders on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Maine to the east, Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. 　Massachusetts is the 6th smallest state by land area but is the 15th most populous state and the 3rd most densely populated, after New Jersey and Rhode Island. 　The state's capital and most populous city, as well as its cultural and financial center, is Boston. 　Massachusetts is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston, the largest metropolitan area in New England and a region profoundly influential upon American history, academia, and the research economy. 　Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing, and trade. 　Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. 　During the 20th century, Massachusetts's economy shifted from manufacturing to services. 　Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. 　Massachusetts was a site of early English colonization: the Plymouth Colony was founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, and in 1630 the Massachusetts Bay Colony, taking its name from the indigenous Massachusett people, established settlements in Boston and Salem. 　In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch trials. 　In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory, which, during the Industrial Revolution, catalyzed numerous important technological advances, including interchangeable parts. 　In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, a populist revolt led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans, influenced the United States Constitutional Convention. 　In the 18th century, the Protestant First Great Awakening, which swept Britain and the Thirteen Colonies, originated from the pulpit of Northampton preacher Jonathan Edwards. 　In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the "Cradle of Liberty" for the agitation there that later led to the American Revolution. 　Massachusetts has played a powerful scientific, commercial, and cultural role in the history of the United States. 　Before the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center for the abolitionist, temperance, and transcendentalist movements. 　In the late 19th century, the sports of basketball and volleyball were invented in the western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, respectively. 　Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legally recognize same-sex marriage as a result of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health in 2004, and Boston is considered a hub of LGBT culture and LGBT activism in the United States. 　Prominent American political dynasties have hailed from the state, including the Adams and Kennedy families. 　Harvard University in Cambridge is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, with the largest financial endowment of any university. 　The university has educated eight Presidents of the United States while Harvard Law School has educated a contemporaneous majority of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. 　Kendall Square in Cambridge has been called "the most innovative square mile on the planet", in reference to the high concentration of entrepreneurial start-ups and quality of innovation which have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010. 　Both Harvard and MIT, also in Cambridge, are perennially ranked as either the most or among the most highly regarded academic institutions in the world. 　The state's public-school students place among the top tier in the world in academic performance. 　Massachusetts has been ranked as one of the top states in the United States for citizens to live in, as well as one of the most expensive. 　Massachusetts is one of the most educated, developed, and wealthiest states, ranking 1st in percentage of population 25 and over with a bachelor's degree and 1st in percentage of population 25 and over with an advanced degree, 1st on both the American Human Development Index and the standard Human Development Index, 1st in per capita income and 2nd in median household income.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(sociology)>Passing (sociology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Passing is the ability of a person to be regarded as a member of an identity group or category, such as racial identity, ethnicity, caste, social class, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age and/or disability status, that is often different from their own. 　Passing may be used to increase social acceptance in order to cope with stigma by removing stigma from the presented self and could result in other social benefits as well. 　Thus, passing may serve as a form of self-preservation or self-protection in instances where expressing one's true or prior identity may be dangerous. 　Passing may require acceptance into a community and may also lead to temporary or permanent leave from another community to which an individual previously belonged. 　Thus, passing can result in separation from one's original self, family, friends, or previous living experiences. 　While successful passing may contribute to economic security, safety, and avoidance of stigma, it may take an emotional toll as a result of denial of one's previous identity and may lead to depression or self-loathing. 　When an individual deliberately attempts to 'pass' as a member of an identity group, they may actively engage in performance of behaviors they believe to be associated with membership of that group. 　Passing practices can also include information management where the passer attempts to control or conceal any stigmatizing information that may reveal disparity from their presumed identity. 　Etymologically, the term is simply the nominalisation of the verb pass in its phrasal use with for or as, as in a counterfeit passing for the genuine article or an impostor passing as another person. 　It has been in popular use since at least the late 1920s.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(topology)>Spectrum (topology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a spectrum is an object representing a generalized cohomology theory. 　Every such cohomology theory is representable, as follows from Brown's representability theorem. 　This means that, given a cohomology theory E ∗ : CW o p → Ab {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}^{*}:{\text{CW}}^{op}\to {\text{Ab}}} , there exist spaces E k {\displaystyle E^{k}} such that evaluating the cohomology theory in degree k {\displaystyle k} on a space X {\displaystyle X} is equivalent to computing the homotopy classes of maps to the space E k {\displaystyle E^{k}} , that is E k ( X ) ≅ [ X , E k ] {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}^{k}(X)\cong \left[X,E^{k}\right]} . 　Note there are several different categories of spectra leading to many technical difficulties, but they all determine the same homotopy category, known as the stable homotopy category. 　This is one of the key points for introducing spectra because they form a natural home for stable homotopy theory.

<font size=3>
A spectrum (plural spectra or spectrums) is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without gaps, across a continuum. 　The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. 　As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. 　It thereby became a mapping of a range of magnitudes (wavelengths) to a range of qualities, which are the perceived "colors of the rainbow" and other properties which correspond to wavelengths that lie outside of the visible light spectrum. 　Spectrum has since been applied by analogy to topics outside optics. 　Thus, one might talk about the "spectrum of political opinion", or the "spectrum of activity" of a drug, or the "autism spectrum". 　In these uses, values within a spectrum may not be associated with precisely quantifiable numbers or definitions. 　Such uses imply a broad range of conditions or behaviors grouped together and studied under a single title for ease of discussion. 　Nonscientific uses of the term spectrum are sometimes misleading. 　For instance, a single left–right spectrum of political opinion does not capture the full range of people's political beliefs. 　Political scientists use a variety of biaxial and multiaxial systems to more accurately characterize political opinion. 　In most modern usages of spectrum there is a unifying theme between the extremes at either end. 　This was not always true in older usage.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census>Census</a> 

<font size=3>
A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring, recording and calculating population information about the members of a given population. 　This term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include censuses of agriculture, traditional culture, business, supplies, and traffic censuses. 　The United Nations (UN) defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as "individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every ten years. 　UN recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practices. 　The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in turn, defines the census of agriculture as "a statistical operation for collecting, processing and disseminating data on the structure of agriculture, covering the whole or a significant part of a country." "In a census of agriculture, data are collected at the holding level." 　The word is of Latin origin: during the Roman Republic, the census was a list that kept track of all adult males fit for military service. 　The modern census is essential to international comparisons of any kind of statistics, and censuses collect data on many attributes of a population, not just how many people there are. 　Censuses typically began as the only method of collecting national demographic data and are now part of a larger system of different surveys. 　Although population estimates remain an important function of a census, including exactly the geographic distribution of the population or the agricultural population, statistics can be produced about combinations of attributes, e.g., education by age and sex in different regions. 　Current administrative data systems allow for other approaches to enumeration with the same level of detail but raise concerns about privacy and the possibility of biasing estimates. 　A census can be contrasted with sampling in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population; typically, main population estimates are updated by such intercensal estimates. 　Modern census data are commonly used for research, business marketing, and planning, and as a baseline for designing sample surveys by providing a sampling frame such as an address register. 　Census counts are necessary to adjust samples to be representative of a population by weighting them as is common in opinion polling. 　Similarly, stratification requires knowledge of the relative sizes of different population strata, which can be derived from census enumerations. 　In some countries, the census provides the official counts used to apportion the number of elected representatives to regions (sometimes controversially – e.g., Utah v. Evans). 　In many cases, a carefully chosen random sample can provide more accurate information than attempts to get a population census.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence>Sequence</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters. 　Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). 　The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. 　Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter. 　Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function from natural numbers (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. 　The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an indexed family, defined as a function from an arbitrary index set. 　For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last. 　This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). 　Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. 　Sequences can be finite, as in these examples, or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...). 　The position of an element in a sequence is its rank or index; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. 　The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. 　In mathematical analysis, a sequence is often denoted by letters in the form of a n {\displaystyle a_{n}} , b n {\displaystyle b_{n}} and c n {\displaystyle c_{n}} , where the subscript n refers to the nth element of the sequence; for example, the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence F {\displaystyle F} is generally denoted as F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} . 　In computing and computer science, finite sequences are sometimes called strings, words or lists, the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in computer memory; infinite sequences are called streams. 　The empty sequence ( ) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del>Del</a> 

<font size=3>
Del, or nabla, is an operator used in mathematics (particularly in vector calculus) as a vector differential operator, usually represented by the nabla symbol ∇. 　When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes the standard derivative of the function as defined in calculus. 　When applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), it may denote any one of three operators depending on the way it is applied: the gradient or (locally) steepest slope of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier–Stokes equations); the divergence of a vector field; or the curl (rotation) of a vector field. 　Strictly speaking, del is not a specific operator, but rather a convenient mathematical notation for those three operators that makes many equations easier to write and remember. 　The del symbol (or nabla) can be interpreted as a vector of partial derivative operators; and its three possible meanings—gradient, divergence, and curl—can be formally viewed as the product with a scalar, a dot product, and a cross product, respectively, of the "del operator" with the field. 　These formal products do not necessarily commute with other operators or products. 　These three uses, detailed below, are summarized as: Gradient: grad ⁡ f = ∇ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {grad} f=\nabla f} Divergence: div ⁡ v → = ∇ ⋅ v → {\displaystyle \operatorname {div} {\vec {v}}=\nabla \cdot {\vec {v}}} Curl: curl ⁡ v → = ∇ × v → {\displaystyle \operatorname {curl} {\vec {v}}=\nabla \times {\vec {v}}}

<font size=3>
A duty (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; Old French: deu, did, past participle of devoir; Latin: debere, debitum, whence "debt") is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise. 　A duty may arise from a system of ethics or morality, especially in an honor culture. 　Many duties are created by law, sometimes including a codified punishment or liability for non-performance. 　Performing one's duty may require some sacrifice of self-interest. 　Cicero, an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources: as a result of being a human as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job) as a result of one's character as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, religion, and social normalities.

<font size=3>
In mathematics, specifically in topology, the interior of a subset S of a topological space X is the union of all subsets of S that are open in X. A point that is in the interior of S is an interior point of S. The interior of S is the complement of the closure of the complement of S. In this sense interior and closure are dual notions. 　The exterior of a set S is the complement of the closure of S; it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary. 　The interior, boundary, and exterior of a subset together partition the whole space into three blocks (or fewer when one or more of these is empty).

<font size=3>
A chart (sometimes known as a graph) is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which "the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart". 　A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info. 　The term "chart" as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings: A data chart is a type of diagram or graph, that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data. 　Maps that are adorned with extra information (map surround) for a specific purpose are often known as charts, such as a nautical chart or aeronautical chart, typically spread over several map sheets. 　Other domain-specific constructs are sometimes called charts, such as the chord chart in music notation or a record chart for album popularity. 　Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. 　Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. 　They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application. 　Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. 　For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as "satisfied, not satisfied, unsure") are often displayed in a pie chart, but maybe more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart. 　On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as "annual revenue from 1990 to 2000") might be best shown as a line chart.

A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. 　Humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, and each dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes, although the dreamer may perceive the dream as being much longer than this. 　The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. 　Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. 　The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. 　Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function. 　It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind. 　The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history. 　Long ago, according to writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia. 　These ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions and may predict future events. 　Framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time. 　Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. 　Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. 　Because REM sleep is detectable in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM, linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream. 　However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports. 　To be studied, a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience itself. 　So, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.

<font size=3>
Recognition in sociology is the public acknowledgment of a person's status or merits (achievements, virtues, service, etc.). 　In psychology, excessively seeking for recognition is regarded as one of the defining traits of a narcissistic personality disorder. 　Another example of recognition is when some person is accorded some special status, such as title or classification. 　According to Charles Taylor, recognition of one's identity is both a fundamental need and a right, and non- or misrecognition is a form of oppression. 　In the workplace, recognition has been suggested to increase employee engagement, continuous improvement behaviour, trust in the organization, intention to stay, and satisfaction with management. 　Others, like Alfie Kohn in Punished by Rewards, point out the dangers of using praise to show recognition, since it may induce compliance in the short-term, but negatively impact quality in the workplace long-term.

<font size=3>
Count (feminine: countess) is a historical title of nobility in certain European countries, varying in relative status, generally of middling rank in the hierarchy of nobility. 　Especially in earlier medieval periods the term often implied not only a certain status, but also that the count had specific responsibilities or offices. 　The etymologically related English term "county" denoted the territories associated with some countships, but not all. 　Although the term count was not generally used in England, after the 1066 conquest by the Normans, the European term "count" was the normal translation used for the English title of "earl", and the wives of earls are still referred to as countesses.

<font size=3>
In topology, a branch of mathematics, a graph is a topological space which arises from a usual graph G = ( E , V ) {\displaystyle G=(E,V)} by replacing vertices by points and each edge e = x y ∈ E {\displaystyle e=xy\in E} by a copy of the unit interval I = [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle I=[0,1]} , where 0 {\displaystyle 0} is identified with the point associated to x {\displaystyle x} and 1 {\displaystyle 1} with the point associated to y {\displaystyle y} . 　That is, as topological spaces, graphs are exactly the simplicial 1-complexes and also exactly the one-dimensional CW complexes. 　Thus, in particular, it bears the quotient topology of the set X 0 ⊔ ⨆ e ∈ E I e {\displaystyle X_{0}\sqcup \bigsqcup _{e\in E}I_{e}} under the quotient map used for gluing. 　Here X 0 {\displaystyle X_{0}} is the 0-skeleton (consisting of one point for each vertex x ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} ), I e {\displaystyle I_{e}} are the intervals ("closed one-dimensional unit balls") glued to it, one for each edge e ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} , and ⊔ {\displaystyle \sqcup } is the disjoint union. 　The topology on this space is called the graph topology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief>Relief</a> 

<font size=3>
Relief is a sculptural method in which the sculpted pieces are bonded to a solid background of the same material. 　The term relief is from the Latin verb relevo, to raise. 　To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane. 　When a relief is carved into a flat surface of stone (relief sculpture) or wood (relief carving), the field is actually lowered, leaving the unsculpted areas seeming higher. 　The approach requires a lot of chiselling away of the background, which takes a long time. 　On the other hand, a relief saves forming the rear of a subject, and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round, especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point, particularly in stone. 　In other materials such as metal, clay, plaster stucco, ceramics or papier-mâché the form can be simply added to or raised up from the background. 　Monumental bronze reliefs are made by casting. 　There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field, for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English. 　The full range includes high relief (alto-rilievo, haut-relief), where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas, mid-relief (mezzo-rilievo), low relief (basso-rilievo), or French: bas-relief (French pronunciation: ​[baʁəljɛf]), and shallow-relief or rilievo schiacciato, where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements. 　There is also sunk relief, which was mainly restricted to Ancient Egypt (see below). 　However, the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important, and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work. 　The definition of these terms is somewhat variable, and many works combine areas in more than one of them, rarely sliding between them in a single figure; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions. 　The opposite of relief sculpture is counter-relief, intaglio, or cavo-rilievo, where the form is cut into the field or background rather than rising from it; this is very rare in monumental sculpture. 　Hyphens may or may not be used in all these terms, though they are rarely seen in "sunk relief" and are usual in "bas-relief" and "counter-relief". 　Works in the technique are described as "in relief", and, especially in monumental sculpture, the work itself is "a relief". 　Reliefs are common throughout the world on the walls of buildings and a variety of smaller settings, and a sequence of several panels or sections of relief may represent an extended narrative. 　Relief is more suitable for depicting complicated subjects with many figures and very active poses, such as battles, than free-standing "sculpture in the round". 　Most ancient architectural reliefs were originally painted, which helped to define forms in low relief. 　The subject of reliefs is for convenient reference assumed in this article to be usually figures, but sculpture in relief often depicts decorative geometrical or foliage patterns, as in the arabesques of Islamic art, and may be of any subject. 　Rock reliefs are those carved into solid rock in the open air (if inside caves, whether natural or man-made, they are more likely to be called "rock-cut"). 　This type is found in many cultures, in particular those of the Ancient Near East and Buddhist countries. 　A stele is a single standing stone; many of these carry reliefs.

<font size=3>
In international relations, aid (also known as international aid, overseas aid, foreign aid, economic aid or foreign assistance) is – from the perspective of governments – a voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another. 　Aid may serve one or more functions: it may be given as a signal of diplomatic approval, or to strengthen a military ally, to reward a government for behavior desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide infrastructure needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of commercial access. 　Countries may provide aid for further diplomatic reasons. 　Humanitarian and altruistic purposes are often reasons for foreign assistance. 　Aid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments. 　Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered "aid" vary from country to country. 　For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958. 　The most widely used measure of aid is "Official Development Assistance" (ODA).

<font size=3>
Religion is a range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion. 　Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacredness, faith, and a supernatural being or beings. 　Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, matrimonial and funerary services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, and/or public service. 　Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred texts, symbols and holy places, that primarily aim to give life meaning. 　Religions may contain symbolic tales that may attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena; some followers believe these to be true stories. 　Traditionally, both faith and reason have been considered sources of religious beliefs. 　There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide, though nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. 　Four religions—Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism—account for over 77% of the world's population, and 92% of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as nonreligious, meaning that the remaining 9,000+ faiths account for only 8% of the population combined. 　The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics, although many in the demographic still have various religious beliefs. 　A portion of the population, mostly located in Africa and Asia, are members of new religious movements. 　Scholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having generally higher birth rates. 　The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, philosophy of religion, comparative religion, and social scientific studies. 　Theories of religion offer various explanations for its origins and workings, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief.

Illinois (/ˌɪlɪˈnɔɪ/ (listen) IL-ə-NOY) is a state in the Midwestern United States. 　Its largest metropolitan areas include the Chicago metropolitan area, and the Metro East section, of Greater St. Louis. 　Other metropolitan areas include Peoria and Rockford, as well as Springfield, its capital. 　Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth-largest population, and the 25th-largest land area. 　Illinois has a highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast, major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. 　Owing to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. 　Additionally, the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash rivers form parts of the state's boundaries. 　Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has been among the world's ten busiest airports for decades. 　Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase Will it play in Peoria?　. 　What is now Illinois was inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous cultures, including the advanced civilization centered in the Cahokia region. 　The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi River in the 17th century, in the region they called Illinois Country, as part of the sprawling colony of New France. 　Following U.S. independence in 1783, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. 　Illinois was part of the United States' oldest territory, the Northwest Territory, and in 1818 it achieved statehood. 　The Erie Canal brought increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes, and the small settlement of Chicago became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, benefiting from its location as one of the few natural harbors in southwestern Lake Michigan. 　The invention of the self-scouring steel plow by Illinoisan John Deere turned the state's rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. 　In the mid-19th century, the Illinois and Michigan Canal and a sprawling railroad network greatly facilitated trade, commerce, and settlement, making the state a transportation hub for the nation. 　By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities, and coal mining in the central and southern areas, attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. 　Illinois became one of America's most industrialized states and remains a major manufacturing center. 　The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans, particularly in Chicago, who founded the city's famous jazz and blues cultures. 　Chicago became a leading cultural, economic, and population center and is today one of the world's major commercial centers; its metropolitan area, informally referred to as Chicagoland, holds about 65% of the state's 12.8 million residents. 　Three U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama; additionally, Ronald Reagan was born and raised in the state. 　Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan Land of Lincoln, which has been displayed on its license plates since 1954. 　The state is the site of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield and the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.

<font size=3>
The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. 　The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. 　According to this theory, space and time emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang. 　While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day. 　Some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. 　Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. 　In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe. 　Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe. 　Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. 　At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. 　At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. 　Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then at an increasing rate. 　According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. 　After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. 　Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. 　Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. 　From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. 　This unseen matter is known as dark matter (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). 　The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of the universe. 　It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter. 　Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical universe. 　Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter. 　There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. 　Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.

<font size=3>
Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. 　These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread. 　Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements. 　While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes. 　Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. 　Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. 　Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol. 　Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants. 　In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 　These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. 　Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. 　Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects. 　Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. 　It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. 　The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, eating resistant starch, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption of processed meat and red meat, and limiting exposure to direct sunlight. 　Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. 　The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial. 　Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. 　Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. 　Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. 　The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. 　In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%. 　For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66%. 　In 2015, about 90.5 million people worldwide had cancer. 　In 2019, annual cancer cases grew by 23.6 million people and there were 10 million deaths worldwide, representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21%, respectively. 　The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer. 　In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. 　If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases. 　In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa, where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often. 　In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer. 　The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries. 　Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world. 　The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated at US$1.16 trillion per year as of 2010[update].

<font size=3>
Cancer (from Latin; sometimes known by the transliteration Carcinos, from the original Greek Καρκίνος: Karkinos) or, simply the Crab, is a giant crab in Greek mythology that inhabited the lagoon of Lerna. 　He is a secondary character in the myth of the twelve labors of Heracles, who attacks Heracles on Hera's orders, while Heracles is in the midst of fighting the Hydra of Lerna. 　Heracles kills the Crab, who is rewarded for his efforts by Hera turning him into the constellation of Cancer. 　Since it is not a main element of the myth, it does not always appear in the versions that have reached the present day; nevertheless, classic mythographers, astronomers, historians or philosophers such as Plato, the Pseudo-Eratosthenes, the Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus mention the character in their texts. 　One of the most common interpretations of the myth associates it with a 22nd century B.C. battle in the Peloponnese, which resulted in the destruction of Lerna (Minoan-influenced) by pre-Mycenaean peoples In art, Carcinos is often depicted as a detail of the myth of the Hydra or as an image of the Zodiac sign and the constellation to which it gives its name.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation>Federation</a> 

<font size=3>
A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). 　In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision, neither by the component states nor the federal political body. 　Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. 　It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. 　For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure "peace and good government" or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. 　The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. 　It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. 　France, for example, has been unitary for many centuries. 　The Austrian Empire was a unitary state with crown lands, after the transformation into the Austria-Hungary monarchy the remaining crown lands of so-called Cisleithania became federated as Länder of the Republic of Austria through the implementation of its constitution. 　Germany, with its 16 states, or Länder, is an example of a federation. 　Federations are often multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory (such as Russia, the United States, Canada, India, or Brazil), but neither is necessarily the case (such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or the Federated States of Micronesia). 　Several ancient chiefdoms and kingdoms, such as the 4th-century BCE League of Corinth, Noricum in Central Europe, and the Iroquois Confederacy in pre-Columbian North America, could be described as federations or confederations. 　The Old Swiss Confederacy was an early example of formal non-unitary statehood. 　Several colonies and dominions in the New World consisted of autonomous provinces, transformed into federal states upon independence such as the United States, and various countries in Latin America (see Spanish American wars of independence). 　Some of the New World federations failed; the Federal Republic of Central America broke up into independent states less than 20 years after its founding. 　Others, such as Argentina, have shifted between federal, confederal, and unitary systems, before settling into federalism. 　Brazil became a federation only after the fall of the monarchy, and Venezuela became a federation after the Federal War. 　Australia and Canada are also federations. 　Germany is another nation-state that has switched between confederal, federal and unitary rules, since the German Confederation was founded in 1815. 　The North German Confederation, the succeeding German Empire and the Weimar Republic were federations. 　Founded in 1922, the Soviet Union was formally a federation of Soviet republics, autonomous republics and other federal subjects, though in practice highly centralized under the government of the Soviet Union. 　The Russian Federation has inherited a similar system. 　India, Pakistan, Nigeria and Malaysia (then Federation of Malaya) became federations on or shortly before becoming independent from the British Empire. 　In some recent cases, federations have been instituted as a measure to handle ethnic conflict within a state, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraq since 2005. 　With the United States Constitution having become effective on 4 March 1789, the United States is the oldest surviving federation, while the newest federation is Nepal, after its constitution went into effect on 20 September 2015.

<font size=3>
A federation is a group of computing or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion. 　The term may be used when describing the inter-operation of two distinct, formally disconnected, telecommunications networks that may have different internal structures. 　The term "federated cloud" refers to facilitating the interconnection of two or more geographically separate computing clouds. 　The term may also be used when groups attempt to delegate collective authority of development to prevent fragmentation. 　In a telecommunication interconnection, the internal modi operandi of the different systems are irrelevant to the existence of a federation. 　Joining two distinct networks: Yahoo! and Microsoft announced that Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger would be interoperable. 　Collective authority: The MIT X Consortium was founded in 1988 to prevent fragmentation in development of the X Window System. 　OpenID, a form of federated identity. 　In networking systems, to be federated means users are able to send messages from one network to the other.　[citation needed] This is not the same as having a client that can operate with both networks, but interacts with both independently. 　For example, in 2009, Google allowed GMail users to log into their AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) accounts from GMail. 　One could not send messages from GTalk accounts or XMPP (which Google/GTalk is federated with—XMPP lingo for federation is s2s, which Facebook and MSN Live's implementations do not support) to AIM screen names, nor vice versa. 　In May 2011, AIM and Gmail federated, allowing users of each network to add and communicate with each other.

A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity. 　A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it. 　The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (that is, The Crown). 　A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules. 　Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of "his" federal government.

In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations). 　For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. 　More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. 　(The arrangement of the members in each set does not matter.) 　If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted by C ( n , k ) {\displaystyle C(n,k)} or C k n {\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}} , is equal to the binomial coefficient ( n k ) = n ( n − 1 ) ⋯ ( n − k + 1 ) k ( k − 1 ) ⋯ 1 , {\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n(n-1)\dotsb (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\dotsb 1}},} which can be written using factorials as n ! k ! 　( n − k ) ! 　{\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {n!　}{k!　(n-k)!　}}} whenever k ≤ n {\displaystyle k\leq n} , and which is zero when k > n {\displaystyle k>n} . 　This formula can be derived from the fact that each k-combination of a set S of n members has k ! 　{\displaystyle k!　} permutations so P k n = C k n × k ! 　{\displaystyle P_{k}^{n}=C_{k}^{n}\times k!　} or C k n = P k n / k ! 　{\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}=P_{k}^{n}/k!　} . 　The set of all k-combinations of a set S is often denoted by ( S k ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\binom {S}{k}}} . 　A combination is a combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition. 　To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-combination with repetition, k-multiset, or k-selection, are often used. 　If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears. 　Although the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. 　For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). 　The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. 　There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.

<font size=3>
Andrew is the English form of a given name common in many countries. 　In the 1990s, it was among the top ten most popular names given to boys in English-speaking countries. 　"Andrew" is frequently shortened to "Andy" or "Drew". 　The word is derived from the Greek: Ἀνδρέας, Andreas, itself related to Ancient Greek: ἀνήρ/ἀνδρός aner/andros, "man" (as opposed to "woman"), thus meaning "manly" and, as consequence, "brave", "strong", "courageous", and "warrior". 　In the King James Bible, the Greek "Ἀνδρέας" is translated as Andrew.

<font size=3>
Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost. 　The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). 　The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations. 　The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock>Stock</a> 

<font size=3>
In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided. 　(Especially in American English, the word "stocks" is also used to refer to shares.) 　A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. 　This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. 　Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders. 　Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. 　The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. 　As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. 　Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. 　Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. 　This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).

<font size=3>
Combat (French for fight) is a purposeful violent conflict meant to physically harm or kill the opposition. 　Combat may be armed (using weapons) or unarmed (not using weapons). 　Combat is sometimes resorted to as a method of self-defense, or can be used as a tool to impose one's will on others. 　An instance of combat can be a stand-alone confrontation or a small part of a much larger violent conflict. 　Instances of combat may also be benign and recreational, as in the cases of combat sports and mock combat. 　Combat may comply with, or be in violation of local or international laws regarding conflict. 　Examples of rules include the Geneva Conventions (covering the treatment of people in war), medieval chivalry, the Marquess of Queensberry rules (covering boxing) and several forms of combat sports.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unless>Unless</a> 

<font size=3>
Unless is the final novel by Canadian writer Carol Shields, first published by Fourth Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins in 2002. 　Semi-autobiographical, it was the capstone to Shields's writing career: she died shortly after its publication in 2003. 　The work was widely acclaimed and nominated for the Booker Prize, the Giller Prize, the Governor General's Award, the Orange Prize for Fiction, and received the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize. 　In 2011, it was a finalist in the Canada Reads competition, where it was defended by actor Lorne Cardinal. 　Like many of her works (especially The Stone Diaries), Unless explores the extraordinary that lies within the ordinary lives of ordinary women. 　The novel is narrated in first person by 44-year-old writer and translator, Reta Winters. 　The book proceeds as a linear series of reflections by Reta, elliptically coming to the thematic center of the story: the seemingly arbitrary decision of Reta's college-aged daughter Norah to drop out of university and live on the street with a cardboard sign affixed to her chest that reads "Goodness". 　Although the novel does not in any way proceed like a mystery, the reasons for Norah's departure from the normal world are Reta's primary motivation in writing. 　In parallel, her relationship with her French mentor (a Holocaust survivor and poet) drives much of her narration and view of herself. 　The novel deals extensively with the role of women and in particular, women's literature. 　Late in the novel, Reta starts to break from herself and write in character as a disenfranchised female writer. 　The underlying theme is that the lives of women are underwritten, ignored, and dealt with as "trivial" by the literary establishment. 　The novel also functions largely as an investigation into the role of writing in general (independent of gender). 　Reta's grief over her daughter's state makes her very inwardly focussed on the process of writing. 　A reflection of this is shown in the title of the book and the chapter titles. 　"Unless" and the chapter titles ("therefore", "else", "instead") are all words that are used to couch the fragmented manner in which life fits together. 　As Shields writes, "A life is full of isolated events, but these events, if they are to form a coherent narrative, require odd pieces of language to link them together, little chips of grammar (mostly adverbs or prepositions) that are hard to define [...] words like therefore, else, other, also, thereof, therefore, instead, otherwise, despite, already, and not yet." 　The novel was adapted into the 2016 film Unless, which stars Catherine Keener as Reta and Hannah Gross as Norah. 　On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Unless on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil>Evil</a> 

<font size=3>
Evil, in a general sense, is defined as the opposite or absence of good. 　It can be an extremely broad concept, although in everyday usage it is often more narrowly used to talk about profound wickedness and against common good. 　It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal moral evil commonly associated with the word, or impersonal natural evil (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal. 　While some religions, world views, and philosophies focus on "good versus evil", others deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people. 　Evil can denote profound immorality, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the human condition, where strife and suffering (cf. Hinduism) are the true roots of evil. 　In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force. 　Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives. 　Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve unbalanced behavior including anger, revenge, hatred, psychological trauma, expediency, selfishness, ignorance, destruction and neglect. 　In some forms of thought, evil is also sometimes perceived as the dualistic antagonistic binary opposite to good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated. 　In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving Nirvana. 　The ethical questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of good and evil, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues. 　While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume one or more evildoers.

Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. 　They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. 　Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. 　Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. 　Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. 　While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. 　With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. 　They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. 　Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. 　Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days. 　Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. 　With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. 　In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. 　The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. 　The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

A battalion is a military unit, typically consisting of 300 to 1,200 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel, and subdivided into a number of companies (usually each commanded by a major or a captain). 　In some countries, battalions are exclusively infantry, while in others battalions are unit-level organizations. 　The word battalion came into the English language in the 16th century from the French language (French: bataillon meaning "battle squadron"; Italian: battaglione meaning the same thing; derived from the Vulgar Latin word battalia meaning "battle" and from the Latin word bauttere meaning "to beat" or "to strike"). 　The first use of the word in English was in the 1580s.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence>Violence</a> 

<font size=3>
Violence is "the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy". 　Other definitions are also used, such as the World Health Organization's definition of violence as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation." 　Internationally, violence resulted in deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. 　However, global population grew by roughly 1.9 billion during those years, showing a dramatic reduction in violence per capita. 　Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. 　For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. 　Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. 　In 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes. 　Violence in many forms can be preventable. 　There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as an concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. 　Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc. have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.

A leg is a weight-bearing and locomotive anatomical structure, usually having a columnar shape. 　During locomotion, legs function as "extensible struts". 　The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional "hip" joint. 　As an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion. 　The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot). 　Most animals have an even number of legs. 　As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface, such as the table top or chair seat.

<font size=3>
A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. 　Equivalently, it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. 　The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. 　Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number. 　A circle with r = 0 {\displaystyle r=0} (a single point) is a degenerate case. 　This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted. 　Specifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. 　In everyday use, the term "circle" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc. 　A circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality>Reality</a> 

<font size=3>
Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent within a system, as opposed to that which is only imaginary, nonexistent or nonactual. 　The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. 　In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown. 　Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of ontology, which is a major branch of metaphysics in the Western philosophical tradition. 　Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the philosophy of science, of religion, of mathematics, and philosophical logic. 　These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., physicalism), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g. idealism), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether a 'God' exists, whether numbers and other abstract objects exist, and whether possible worlds exist. 　Epistemology is concerned with what can be known or inferred as likely and how, whereby in the modern world emphasis is put on reason, empirical evidence and science as sources and methods to determine or investigate reality.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee>Coffee</a> 

<font size=3>
Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. 　Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. 　It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks. 　Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. 　The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. 　It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. 　Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). 　Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. 　Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. 　The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. 　The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. 　By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. 　In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world. 　The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. 　Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. 　As of 2018[update], Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. 　Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. 　Despite sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. 　Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.

<font size=3>
In marine and freshwater ecology, a particle is a small object. 　Particles can remain in suspension in the ocean or freshwater. 　However, they eventually settle (rate determined by Stokes' law) and accumulate as sediment. 　Some can enter the atmosphere through wave action where they can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). 　Many organisms filter particles out of the water with unique filtration mechanisms (filter feeders). 　Particles are often associated with high loads of toxins which attach to the surface. 　As these toxins are passed up the food chain they accumulate in fatty tissue and become increasingly concentrated in predators (see bioaccumulation). 　Very little is known about the dynamics of particles, especially when they are re-suspended by dredging. 　They can remain floating in the water and drift over long distances. 　The decomposition of some particles by bacteria consumes much oxygen and can cause the water to become hypoxic.

<font size=3>
In the physical sciences, a particle (or corpuscule in older texts) is a small localized object which can be described by several physical or chemical properties, such as volume, density, or mass. 　They vary greatly in size or quantity, from subatomic particles like the electron, to microscopic particles like atoms and molecules, to macroscopic particles like powders and other granular materials. 　Particles can also be used to create scientific models of even larger objects depending on their density, such as humans moving in a crowd or celestial bodies in motion. 　The term particle is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields. 　Anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate. 　However, the noun particulate is most frequently used to refer to pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere, which are a suspension of unconnected particles, rather than a connected particle aggregation.

<font size=3>
An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called "readers"), theatre, music (in which they are called "listeners"), video games (in which they are called "players"), or academics in any medium. 　Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art. 　Some events invite overt audience participation and others allow only modest clapping and criticism and reception. 　Media audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. 　Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. 　These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. 　The biggest art form is the mass media. 　Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations. 　In the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. 　American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, "Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don't give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will." 　Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, "The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be — what application, what device, what time, what place."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire>Desire</a> 

<font size=3>
Desires are states of mind that are expressed by terms like "wanting", "wishing", "longing" or "craving". 　A great variety of features is commonly associated with desires. 　They are seen as propositional attitudes towards conceivable states of affairs. 　They aim to change the world by representing how the world should be, unlike beliefs, which aim to represent how the world actually is. 　Desires are closely related to agency: they motivate the agent to realize them. 　For this to be possible, a desire has to be combined with a belief about which action would realize it. 　Desires present their objects in a favorable light, as something that appears to be good. 　Their fulfillment is normally experienced as pleasurable in contrast to the negative experience of failing to do so. 　Conscious desires are usually accompanied by some form of emotional response. 　While many researchers roughly agree on these general features, there is significant disagreement about how to define desires, i.e. which of these features are essential and which ones are merely accidental. 　Action-based theories define desires as structures that incline us toward actions. 　Pleasure-based theories focus on the tendency of desires to cause pleasure when fulfilled. 　Value-based theories identify desires with attitudes toward values, like judging or having an appearance that something is good. 　Desires can be grouped into various types according to a few basic distinctions. 　Intrinsic desires concern what the subject wants for its own sake while instrumental desires are about what the subject wants for the sake of something else. 　Occurrent desires are either conscious or otherwise causally active, in contrast to standing desires, which exist somewhere in the back of one's mind. 　Propositional desires are directed at possible states of affairs while object-desires are directly about objects. 　Various authors distinguish between higher desires associated with spiritual or religious goals and lower desires, which are concerned with bodily or sensory pleasures. 　Desires play a role in many different fields. 　There is disagreement whether desires should be understood as practical reasons or whether we can have practical reasons without having a desire to follow them. 　According to fitting-attitude theories of value, an object is valuable if it is fitting to desire this object or if we ought to desire it. 　Desire-satisfaction theories of well-being state that a person's well-being is determined by whether that person's desires are satisfied. 　Marketing and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers into buying a given product or service. 　Techniques include creating a sense of lack in the viewer or associating the product with desirable attributes. 　Desire plays a key role in art. 　The theme of desire is at the core of romance novels, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions, class, or cultural barriers. 　Melodrama films use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition>Exhibition</a> 

<font size=3>
An exhibition, in the most general sense, is an organized presentation and display of a selection of items. 　In practice, exhibitions usually occur within a cultural or educational setting such as a museum, art gallery, park, library, exhibition hall, or World's fairs. 　Exhibitions can include many things such as art in both major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive exhibitions, natural history museums and history museums, and also varieties such as more commercially focused exhibitions and trade fairs. 　In British English the word "exhibition" is used for a collection of items placed on display and the event as a whole, which in American English is usually an "exhibit". 　In both varieties of English each object being shown within an exhibition is an "exhibit". 　In common usage, "exhibitions" are considered temporary and usually scheduled to open and close on specific dates. 　While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations and are called travelling exhibitions, and some are online exhibitions. 　Exhibitions featuring especially fragile or valuable objects, or live animals—may be shown only during a formal presentation, under the close supervision of attendant or educator. 　Temporary exhibits that are transported from institution to institution are traveling exhibits. 　Though exhibitions are common events, the concept of an exhibition is quite wide and encompasses many variables. 　Exhibitions range from an extraordinarily large event such as a World's fair exposition to small one-artist solo shows or a display of just one item. 　Often a team of specialists is required to assemble and execute an exhibition; these specialists vary depending on the type of said exhibit. 　Curators are sometimes involved as the people who select the items in an exhibition. 　Writers and editors are sometimes needed to write text, labels and accompanying printed material such as catalogs and books. 　Architects, exhibition designers, graphic designers and other designers may be needed to shape the exhibition space and give form to the editorial content. 　Organizing and holding exhibitions also requires effective event planning, management, and logistics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra>Orchestra</a> 

<font size=3>
An orchestra (/ˈɔːrkɪstrə/; Italian: [orˈkɛstra]) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which combines instruments from different families. 　There are typically four main sections of instruments: bowed string instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass woodwinds, such as the flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon Brass instruments, such as the horn, trumpet, trombone, cornet, and tuba percussion instruments, such as the timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and mallet percussion instruments Other instruments such as the piano, harpsichord, and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone as soloist instruments, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments and guitars. 　A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra (from Greek phil-, "loving", and "harmony"). 　The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. 　A chamber orchestra (sometimes concert orchestra) is a smaller ensemble of not more than about fifty musicians. 　Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire such as the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. 　The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler. 　Orchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a conductor's baton. 　The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes the sound of the ensemble. 　The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed. 　The leader of the first violin section – commonly called the concertmaster – also plays an important role in leading the musicians. 　In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster, or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue. 　Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets, and some types of musical theatre (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas). 　Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region. 　The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα (orchestra), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell>Bell</a> 

<font size=3>
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument. 　Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator. 　The strike may be made by an internal "clapper" or "uvula", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell). 　Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials. 　This depends on the function. 　Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal. 　Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower. 　Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters. 　Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services. 　Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom. 　The study of bells is called campanology.

<font size=3>
A roof (PL: roofs or rooves) is the top covering of a building, including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind. 　A roof is part of the building envelope. 　The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice, and may also be governed by local or national legislation. 　In most countries, a roof protects primarily against rain. 　A verandah may be roofed with material that protects against sunlight but admits the other elements. 　The roof of a garden conservatory protects plants from cold, wind, and rain, but admits light. 　A roof may also provide additional living space, for example, a roof garden.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon>Moon</a> 

<font size=3>
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 　It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). 　The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. 　It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. 　Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density. 　The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter. 　Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. 　The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. 　During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. 　The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. 　However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration. 　The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. 　It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. 　The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. 　Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. 　The lunar surface is fairly non-reflective, with the reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that of asphalt. 　However, due to its large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. 　The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. 　Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history. 　Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. 　The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. 　The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. 　These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history. 　As of 2023, the Moon is the only other celestial body visited by humans, other than the Earth.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron>Electron</a> 

<font size=3>
The electron ( e− or β− ) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge. 　Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. 　The electron's mass is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. 　Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. 　Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. 　Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: They can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. 　The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy. 　Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. 　Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field. 　Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. 　Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. 　Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. 　Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. 　Electrons are involved in many applications such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, electronics, welding, cathode-ray tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators. 　Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. 　The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. 　Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. 　The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. 　In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. 　Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the cathode-ray tube experiment. 　Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. 　Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. 　The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical charge of the opposite sign. 　When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be annihilated, producing gamma ray photons.

<font size=3>
An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. 　In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources. 　A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. 　These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. 　In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone. 　Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. 　Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. 　However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. 　Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. 　It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition>Tradition</a> 

<font size=3>
A tradition is a belief or behavior (folk custom) passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. 　A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. 　Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word tradition itself derives from the Latin tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. 　While it is commonly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. 　Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. 　The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. 　Tradition is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. 　For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." 　This tradition may never be proven or disproven. 　In another example, "King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories." 　Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.　[citation needed] Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in social sciences such as folklore studies, anthropology, archaeology, and biology. 　The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. 　For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. 　In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. 　For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. 　A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. 　In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. 　Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

<font size=3>
Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying individuals, events, or places that are imaginary, or in ways that are imaginary. 　Fictional portrayals are thus inconsistent with history, fact, or plausibility. 　In a traditional narrow sense, "fiction" refers to written narratives in prose – often referring specifically to novels, novellas, and short stories. 　More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games.

<font size=3>
An injury is any physiological damage to living tissue caused by immediate physical stress. 　An injury can occur intentionally or unintentionally and may be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burning, toxic exposure, asphyxiation, or overexertion. 　Injuries can occur in any part of the body, and different symptoms are associated with different injuries. 　Treatment of a major injury is typically carried out by a health professional and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. 　Traffic collisions are the most common cause of accidental injury and injury-related death among humans. 　Injuries are distinct from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, infections, or medical procedures, though injury can be a contributing factor to any of these. 　Several major health organizations have established systems for the classification and description of human injuries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade>Brigade</a> 

<font size=3>
A brigade is a major tactical military formation that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. 　It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. 　Two or more brigades may constitute a division. 　Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). 　In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. 　Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups. 　On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task. 　Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. 　Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure. 　The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 5,000 troops. 　However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could start as high as 10,000 troops. 　The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use "regiment" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II. 　A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. 　In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. 　The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. 　The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. 　Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. 　Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. 　The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. 　On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. 　The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit. 　In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.

A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. 　In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. 　Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. 　Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. 　Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history. 　In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. 　Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. 　The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.

<font size=3>
Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game, often competitive and/or organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 　Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. 　Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 　In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. 　Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. 　A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 　Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. 　Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition. 　Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports. 　However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. 　The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. 　Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 　Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 　It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression. 　Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. 　Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. 　Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport. 　According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. 　The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.

Progress is the movement towards a refined, improved, or otherwise desired state. 　In the context of progressivism, it refers to the proposition that advancements in technology, science, and social organization have resulted, and by extension will continue to result, in an improved human condition; the latter may happen as a result of direct human action, as in social enterprise or through activism, or as a natural part of sociocultural evolution. 　The concept of progress was introduced in the early-19th-century social theories, especially social evolution as described by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. 　It was present in the Enlightenment's philosophies of history. 　As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

In artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the term situated refers to an agent which is embedded in an environment. 　The term situated is commonly used to refer to robots, but some researchers argue that software agents can also be situated if: they exist in a dynamic (rapidly changing) environment, which they can manipulate or change through their actions, and which they can sense or perceive. 　Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as Second Life. 　Being situated is generally considered to be part of being embodied, but it is useful to consider each perspective individually. 　The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behaviour derives from the environment and the agent's interactions with it. 　The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.

Colonel (abbreviated as Col., Col or COL) is a senior military officer rank used in many countries. 　It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. 　In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army. 　Modern usage varies greatly, and in some cases, the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military service. 　The rank of colonel is typically above the rank of lieutenant colonel. 　The rank above colonel is typically called brigadier, brigade general or brigadier general. 　In some smaller military forces, such as those of Monaco or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. 　Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain. 　In the Commonwealth's air force ranking system, the equivalent rank is group captain.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea>Korea</a> 

<font size=3>
Korea (Korean: 한국, Hanguk or 조선, Joseon) is a peninsular region in East Asia. 　Since 1945, it has been divided at or near the 38th parallel, with North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) comprising its northern half and South Korea (Republic of Korea) comprising its southern half. 　Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. 　The peninsula is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. 　It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea). 　During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. 　In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the "Unified Silla" period. 　Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. 　Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. 　Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. 　Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. 　Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. 　However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. 　Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon on 17 July 1392. 　The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace. 　During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. 　During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "hermit kingdom". 　Korea was removed from Chinese suzerainty following the Qing dynasty's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, and Gojong of Korea subsequently proclaimed the Korean Empire in 1897. 　The unexpected victory of Japan in the Russo-Japanese War spelled the end of Russian imperial ambitions in Korea, and Japan was left with no other rivals in the region. 　The Korean Empire subsequently became a protectorate of Japan on 17 November 1905, and was later annexed by Japan on 22 August 1910. 　Japan relinquished control over Korea after formally surrendering to the Allies on 2 September 1945, in the aftermath of World War II. 　The Soviet Union and the United States had agreed to partition Korea along the 38th parallel, with the Soviets occupying the north and the Americans occupying the south. 　These circumstances became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers with two different ideologies, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. 　The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two sovereign states in 1948: North Korea, and South Korea. 　Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. 　With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalised peace treaty. 　This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula, and both states continue to claim to be the sole legitimate one of the region. 　A breakthrough in the peace process came on 27 April 2018, when North Korea and South Korea signed the Panmunjom Declaration on ending the conflict and reunifying Korea.

A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller's good or service from those of other sellers. 　Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. 　Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands. 　The practice of branding - in the original literal sense of marking by burning - is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who are known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE.　[need quotation to verify] Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. 　If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. 　The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that "brand" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. 　It includes the voice and the tonality of the business. 　Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry). 　Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice. 　In the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers. 　The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by logos and trademarks), brand awareness, brand loyalty, and various branding (brand management) strategies. 　Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of product differentiation. 　Brand equity is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components. 　As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity. 　A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits. 　When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity. 　Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. 　In accounting, a brand, defined as an intangible asset, is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. 　Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value. 　Brand valuation is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. 　Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value. 　The word "brand" is often used as a metonym referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. 　Marque or make are often used to denote a brand of motor vehicle, which may be distinguished from a car model. 　A concept brand is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like breast-cancer awareness or environmentalism, rather than a specific product, service, or business. 　A commodity brand is a brand associated with a commodity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection>Detection</a> 

<font size=3>
In general, detection is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from with the sender. 　In the history of radio communications, the term "detector" was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio signal, since all communications were in Morse code. 　The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic waves present. 　Detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier signal, as in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting, but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from noise, as in radio astronomy, or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in steganography. 　In optoelectronics, "detection" means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. 　For example, the light signal received through an optical fiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode. 　In steganography, attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as steganalysis. 　Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. 　In the military, detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance. 　Finally, the art of detection, also known as following clues, is the work of a detective in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.

<font size=3>
A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience. 　The performance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, choir, or band. 　Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls, amphitheatres and parks, to large multipurpose buildings, such as arenas and stadiums. 　Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts. 　Informal names for a concert include show and gig. 　Regardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage (if not actual then an area of the floor designated as such). 　Concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment. 　Before recorded music, concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play. 　For large concerts or concert tours, the challenging logistics of arranging the musicians, venue, equipment and audience (ticket sales) are handled by professional tour promoters.

<font size=3>
Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the processing of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. 　Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE), although this theory is disputed by some. 　Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. 　Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. 　"Natural philosophy," which began as a discipline in ancient India and Ancient Greece, encompasses astronomy, medicine, and physics. 　For example, Isaac Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. 　In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. 　Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the social sciences such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. 　Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises. 　Other notable subfields include philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.

<font size=3>
A gate or gateway is a point of entry to or from a space enclosed by walls. 　The word derived from old Norse "gat" meaning road or path; But other terms include yett and port. 　The concept originally referred to the gap or hole in the wall or fence, rather than a barrier which closed it. 　Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative. 　The moving part or parts of a gateway may be considered "doors", as they are fixed at one side whilst opening and closing like one. 　A gate may have a latch that can be raised and lowered to both open a gate or prevent it from swinging. 　Locks are also used on gates to increase the security. 　Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a castle or fortified town. 　Actual doors can also be considered gates when they are used to block entry as prevalent within a gatehouse. 　Today, many gate doors are opened by an automated gate operator.
