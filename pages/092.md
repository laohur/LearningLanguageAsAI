<font size=3>
Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life. 　Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. 　Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority. 　Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare environments; but there is evidence of international shortages of qualified nurses. 　Nurses collaborate with other healthcare providers such as physicians, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and psychologists. 　Unlike nurse practitioners, nurses typically can not prescribe medications in the US. 　Nurse practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing. 　They practice independently in a variety of settings in more than half of the United States. 　Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing. 　Nurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family, and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life. 　In the United Kingdom and the United States, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe the correct medications and other therapies, depending on particular state regulations. 　Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners, and dietitians. 　Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals. 　In addition to providing care and support, nurses educate the public, and promote health and wellness.

<font size=3>
A bullet is a kinetic projectile, a component of firearm ammunition that is shot from a gun barrel. 　They are made of a variety of materials, such as copper, lead, steel, polymer, rubber and even wax; and are made in various shapes and constructions (depending on the intended applications), including specialized functions such as hunting, target shooting, training and combat. 　Bullets are often tapered, making them more aerodynamic. 　Bullet size is expressed by weight and diameter (referred to as "caliber") in both imperial and metric measurement systems. 　Bullets do not normally contain explosives but strike or damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya>Kenya</a> 
<font size=3>
Coordinates: 1°N 38°E﻿ / ﻿1°N 38°E﻿ / 1; 38 Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Kenya), is a country in East Africa. 　At 580,367 square kilometres (224,081 sq mi), Kenya is the world's 48th largest country by area. 　With a population of more than 47.6 million in the 2019 census, Kenya is the 27th most populous country in the world. 　Kenya's capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest, currently second largest city, and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa. 　Kisumu City is the third-largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria. 　Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret. 　As of 2020, Kenya is the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. 　Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, Ethiopia to the north, Somalia to the east, Uganda to the west, Tanzania to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. 　Its geography, climate and population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped mountaintops (Batian, Nelion and Point Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates in western and rift valley counties and dry less fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts (Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert). 　Kenya's earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, like the present-day Hadza people. 　According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, Cushitic speakers first settled in Kenya's lowlands between 3,200 and 1,300 BC, a phase known as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. 　Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) began migrating from present-day South Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC. 　Bantu people settled at the coast and the interior between 250 BC and 500 AD. 　European contact began in 1500 AD with the Portuguese Empire, and effective colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior. 　Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in 1920. 　Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution, which began in 1952, and the declaration of independence in 1963. 　After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. 　The current constitution was adopted in 2010 and replaced the 1963 independence constitution. 　Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic, in which elected officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and government. 　Kenya is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, COMESA, International Criminal Court, as well as other international organisations. 　With a GNI of 1,840, Kenya is a lower-middle-income economy. 　Kenya's economy is the largest in eastern and central Africa, with Nairobi serving as a major regional commercial hub. 　Agriculture is the largest sector: tea and coffee are traditional cash crops, while fresh flowers are a fast-growing export. 　The service industry is also a major economic driver, particularly tourism. 　Kenya is a member of the East African Community trade bloc, though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the Greater Horn of Africa. 　Africa is Kenya's largest export market, followed by the European Union.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision>Collision</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics, a collision is any event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other in a relatively short time. 　Although the most common use of the word collision refers to incidents in which two or more objects collide with great force, the scientific use of the term implies nothing about the magnitude of the force. 　Some examples of physical interactions that scientists would consider collisions are the following: When an insect lands on a plant's leaf, its legs are said to collide with the leaf. 　When a cat strides across a lawn, each contact that its paws make with the ground is considered a collision, as well as each brush of its fur against a blade of grass. 　When a boxer throws a punch, their fist is said to collide with the opponents body. 　When an astronomical object merges with a black hole, they are considered to collide. 　Some colloquial uses of the word collision are the following: A traffic collision involves at least one automobile. 　A mid-air collision occurs between airplanes. 　A ship collision accurately involves at least two moving maritime vessels hitting each other; the related term, allision, describes when a moving ship strikes a stationary object (often, but not always, another ship). 　In physics, collisions can be classified by the change in the total kinetic energy of the system before and after the collision: If most or all of the total kinetic energy is lost (dissipated as heat, sound, etc. or absorbed by the objects themselves), the collision is said to be inelastic; such collisions involve objects coming to a full stop. 　An example of such a collision is a car crash, as cars crumple inward when crashing, rather than bouncing off of each other. 　This is by design, for the safety of the occupants and bystanders should a crash occur - the frame of the car absorbs the energy of the crash instead. 　If most of the kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. the objects continue moving afterwards), the collision is said to be elastic. 　An example of this is a baseball bat hitting a baseball - the kinetic energy of the bat is transferred to the ball, greatly increasing the ball's velocity. 　The sound of the bat hitting the ball represents the loss of energy. 　And if all of the total kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. no energy is released as sound, heat, etc.), the collision is said to be perfectly elastic. 　Such a system is an idealization and cannot occur in reality, due to the second law of thermodynamics.

<font size=3>
Citizenship is an allegiance of person to a state. 　Each state determines the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. 　Recognition by a state as a citizen generally carries with it recognition of civil, political, and social rights which are not afforded to non-citizens. 　In general, the basic rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country, and to work there. 　Some countries permit their citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing>Sailing</a> 
<font size=3>
Sailing craft and their rigs Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, raft, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation. 　From prehistory until the second half of the 19th century, sailing craft were the primary means of maritime trade and transportation; exploration across the seas and oceans was reliant on sail for anything other than the shortest distances. 　Naval power in this period used sail to varying degrees depending on the current technology, culminating in the gun-armed sailing warships of the Age of Sail. 　Sail was slowly replaced by steam as the method of propulsion for ships over the latter part of the 19th century – seeing a gradual improvement in the technology of steam through a number of stepwise developments. 　Steam allowed scheduled services that ran at higher average speeds than sailing vessels. 　Large improvements in fuel economy allowed steam to progressively outcompete sail in, ultimately, all commercial situations, giving ship-owning investors a better return on capital.　: 9, 16  In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport. 　Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising. 　Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing. 　Sailing relies on the physics of sails as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. 　On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the apparent wind, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. 　The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft which are steering the course. 　This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. 　The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a point of sail. 　Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.

<font size=3>
An editorial, or leading article (UK) or leader (UK) is an article written by the senior editorial people or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned. 　Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, often classify editorials under the heading "opinion". 　Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons. 　Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on. 　Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name think pieces) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. 　However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. 　In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France. 　Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. 　Tom Clark, leader-writer for The Guardian, says that it ensures readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author. 　On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. 　Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility. 　In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.

Ruins (from Latin ruina 'a collapse') are the remains of a civilization's architecture. 　The term refers to formerly intact structures that have fallen into a state of partial or total disrepair over time due to a variety of factors, such as lack of maintenance, deliberate destruction by humans, or uncontrollable destruction by natural phenomena. 　The most common root causes that yield ruins in their wake are natural disasters, armed conflict, and population decline, with many structures becoming progressively derelict over time due to long-term weathering and scavenging. 　There are famous ruins all over the world, with notable sites originating from ancient China, the Indus Valley and other regions of ancient India, ancient Iran, ancient Israel and Judea, ancient Iraq, ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, Roman sites throughout the Mediterranean Basin, and Incan and Mayan sites in the Americas. 　Ruins are of great importance to historians, archaeologists and anthropologists, whether they were once individual fortifications, places of worship, ancient universities, houses and utility buildings, or entire villages, towns, and cities. 　Many ruins have become UNESCO World Heritage Sites in recent years, to identify and preserve them as areas of outstanding value to humanity.

Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/; Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formally the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. 　It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. 　Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. 　Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. 　Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. 　The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. 　In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. 　Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. 　The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. 　The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. 　The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. 　By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. 　The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. 　The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. 　Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. 　The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy. 　The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. 　Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. 　Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. 　Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. 　The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.

A nickname or short name is a substitute for the proper name of a familiar person, place or thing. 　Commonly used to express affection, a form of endearment, and sometimes amusement, it can also be used to express defamation of character. 　As a concept, it is distinct from both pseudonym and stage name, and also from a title (for example, City of Fountains), although there may be overlap in these concepts.

<font size=3>
In geology, basement and crystalline basement are crystalline rocks lying above the mantle and beneath all other rocks and sediments. 　They are sometimes exposed at the surface, but often they are buried under miles of rock and sediment. 　The basement rocks lie below a sedimentary platform or cover, or more generally any rock below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. 　In the same way, the sediments or sedimentary rocks on top of the basement can be called a "cover" or "sedimentary cover". 　Crustal rocks are modified several times before they become basement, and these transitions alter their composition.

<font size=3>
A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are completely or partly below the ground floor. 　It generally is used as a utility space for a building, where such items as the furnace, water heater, breaker panel or fuse box, car park, and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical system and cable television distribution point. 　In cities with high property prices, such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space. 　In British English, the word basement is usually used for underground floors of, for example, department stores. 　The word is usually used with houses when the space below the ground floor is habitable, with windows and (usually) its own access. 　The word cellar applies to the whole underground level or to any large underground room. 　A subcellar or subbasement is a cellar that lies further underneath.

<font size=3>
In geology, a suite is a lithodemic unit consisting of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class (metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary). 　The law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. 　Such bodies of rock are described as lithodemic and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. 　The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal term lithodeme, which is comparable to a formation. 　A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. 　A suite is a group of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class. 　It differs from a complex, which is a group of two or more lithodemes of different genetic classes.

<font size=3>
In pencil and paper games and computer and video games, an item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character. 　These items are sometimes called pick-ups. 　Items are most often beneficial to the player character. 　Some games contain detrimental items, such as cursed pieces of armor that confers a negative bonus to the wearer and cannot be removed until the curse itself is lifted; the means to do this may be costly or require a special item. 　Some items may also be of absolutely no value to the player. 　Items are especially prevalent in role-playing games, as they are usually necessary for the completion of quests or to advance through the story. 　Sometimes certain items may be unique, and only appear once at a specific location, often after completing a particular task. 　Other items may appear frequently, and not give a big bonus alone, but when many are collected. 　Games may differ on how the player uses an item. 　Some games, many in the Mario and Sonic series, an item is automatically used when the player character comes into contact with it. 　There are also games, such as those in the Streets of Rage series, and the first Prince of Persia games where the player character may walk over an item without collecting it, if they do not need it yet, and the player must push a particular button for the character to collect it, but it still used immediately, when the button is pressed. 　Other times, some games, like many role playing games, an item can be collected either automatically or manually, but will not be used immediately, the item can be carried around and used manually either straight away if they wish or at a later time when the player needs it.
