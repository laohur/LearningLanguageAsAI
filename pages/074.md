<font size=3>
A patent is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention. 　In most countries, patent rights fall under private law and the patent holder must sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights. 　In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage; in others they are irrelevant.　: 17  The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. 　Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims that define the scope of protection that is being sought. 　A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. 　Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. 　Nevertheless, there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country, also among WTO member states. 　TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.

<font size=3>
A signature (/ˈsɪɡnətʃər/; from Latin: signare, "to sign") is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple "X" or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent. 　The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer. 　Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator. 　A signature may be confused with an autograph, which is chiefly an artistic signature. 　This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.

<font size=3>
A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often for orchestra. 　Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. 　Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section (violin, viola, cello, and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians. 　Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. 　Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument. 　Some symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).

<font size=3>
Brooklyn (/ˈbrʊklɪn/) is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Kings County, in the U.S. state of New York. 　Kings County is the most populous county in the State of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, behind New York County (Manhattan). 　Brooklyn is also New York City's most populous borough, with 2,736,074 residents in 2020. 　Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen, Brooklyn is located on the westernmost edge of Long Island and shares a border with the borough of Queens. 　It has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan, across the East River, and is connected to Staten Island by way of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. 　With a land area of 70.82 square miles (183.4 km2) and a water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is the state of New York's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area. 　Brooklyn was founded by the Dutch in the 17th century and grew into a busy port city by the 19th century. 　On January 1, 1898, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, in accordance to the new Municipal Charter of "Greater New York", Brooklyn was consolidated in and annexed (along with other areas) to form the current five borough structure of New York City. 　The borough continues to maintain some distinct culture. 　Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves. 　Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough seal and flag, is Eendraght Maeckt Maght, which translates from early modern Dutch as "Unity makes strength." 　In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as a destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. 　Some new developments are required to include affordable housing units. 　Since the 2010s, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship, high technology start-up firms, postmodern art and design.

<font size=3>
Jeans are a type of pants or trousers made from denim or dungaree cloth. 　Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style of trousers, called "blue jeans", with copper-riveted pockets which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in 1871 and patented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. 　Prior to the patent, the term "blue jeans" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim. 　"Jean" also references a (historic) type of sturdy cloth commonly made with a cotton warp and wool weft (also known as "Virginia cloth"). 　Jean cloth can be entirely cotton as well, similar to denim. 　Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. 　From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. 　Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of specialty trousers in Western culture. 　Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort>Comfort</a> 
<font size=3>
Comfort (or being comfortable) is a sense of physical or psychological ease, often characterized as a lack of hardship. 　Persons who are lacking in comfort are uncomfortable, or experiencing discomfort. 　A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant memories, such as engaging in familiar activities, maintaining the presence of familiar objects, and consumption of comfort foods. 　Comfort is a particular concern in health care, as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery. 　Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being "in their comfort zone". 　Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective. 　The use of "comfort" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of pain, suffering or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. 　Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with consolation or solace. 　However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. 　For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. 　Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being "comfy".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky>Rocky</a> 
<font size=3>
Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. 　It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. 　In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), an uneducated, small-time club fighter and debt collector gets an unlikely shot at the world heavyweight championship held by Apollo Creed (Weathers). 　Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. 　It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. 　Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks. 　With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, Rocky popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film. 　Rocky had its premiere in New York City on November 21, 1976, and was released in the United States on December 3. 　Rocky became the highest-grossing film of 1976, earning approximately $225 million worldwide. 　The film received critical acclaim toward Stallone's writing, performance, the story, as well as the film's direction, score, cinematography and editing; among other accolades, it received ten Academy Award nominations and won three, including Best Picture. 　It has been ranked by numerous publications as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as one of the most iconic sports film ever made. 　Rocky and its theme song have become a pop-cultural phenomenon and an important part of 1970s American popular culture spawning a franchise. 　In 2006, the Library of Congress selected Rocky for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different chemical substances which are not chemically bonded. 　A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions and colloids. 　Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. 　Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. 　Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. 　Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova>Nova</a> 
<font size=3>
A nova (plural novae or novas) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", which is Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months. 　Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. 　All observed novae involve white dwarfs in close binary systems. 　The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. 　They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. 　Classical nova eruptions are the most common type. 　They are likely created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a main sequence, subgiant, or red giant star. 　When the orbital period falls in the range of several days to one day, the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to start drawing accreted matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, which creates a dense but shallow atmosphere. 　This atmosphere, mostly consisting of hydrogen, is thermally heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature causing ignition of rapid runaway fusion. 　The sudden increase in energy expels the atmosphere into interstellar space creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event. 　Such were taken in past centuries to be a new star. 　A few novae produce short-lived nova remnants, lasting for perhaps several centuries. 　Recurrent nova processes are the same as the classical nova, except that the fusion ignition may be repetitive because the companion star can again feed the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf. 　Novae most often occur in the sky along the path of the Milky Way, especially near the observed Galactic Center in Sagittarius; however, they can appear anywhere in the sky. 　They occur far more frequently than galactic supernovae, averaging about ten per year in the Milky Way. 　Most are found telescopically, perhaps only one every 12–18 months reaching naked-eye visibility. 　Novae reaching first or second magnitude occur only several times per century. 　The last bright nova was V1369 Centauri reaching 3.3 magnitude on 14 December 2013.

Coordinates: 15°N 101°E﻿ / ﻿15°N 101°E﻿ / 15; 101 You may need rendering support to display the Thai text in this article correctly. 　Thailand (/ˈtaɪlænd, -lənd/ TY-land, -⁠lənd), historically known as Siam (/saɪˈæm, ˈsaɪæm/) and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia, located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million. 　The country is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the extremity of Myanmar. 　Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. 　Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city. 　Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century. 　Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. 　European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. 　Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. 　Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. 　He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. 　Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid colonization by foreign powers, although it was often forced to make territorial, trade and legal concessions in unequal treaties. 　The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of Chulalongkorn. 　In World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. 　Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II. 　In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. 　Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed SEATO, but from 1975 sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbours. 　Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. 　Since the 2000s the country has been caught in continual bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution, a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021 which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. 　Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on power. 　Thailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN, and ranks very high in the Human Development Index. 　It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 22nd-largest in the world by PPP. 　Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy, with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.

Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. 　The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. 　The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). 　The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors. 　Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. 　There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. 　Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives. 　Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges. 　Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders.

<font size=3>
Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. 　It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. 　Paint can be made in many colors—and in many different types. 　Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. 　Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. 　For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers.　[citation needed] Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. 　Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 °C (50 °F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 °C (35 °F).

<font size=3>
A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, or chesterfield, is a cushioned item of furniture for seating multiple people (although it is not uncommon for a single person to use a couch alone). 　It is commonly found in the form of a bench with upholstered armrests and is often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows. 　Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping. 　In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den, or lounge. 　They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars. 　Couches can also vary in size, color, and design.

<font size=3>
Islam (/ˈɪslɑːm/; Arabic: ۘالِإسلَام, al-ʾIslām [ɪsˈlaːm] (listen), transl. 　"Submission [to God]") is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion centered around the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad. 　Adherents of Islam, called Muslims, number approximately 1.9 billion globally and are the world's second-largest religious population after Christians. 　Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, among others; these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. 　Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God and the unaltered, final revelation. 　They also consider Muhammad as the main and final Islamic prophet. 　The teachings and normative example of Muhammad, called the sunnah, documented in accounts called the hadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims. 　Islam teaches that God is one and incomparable. 　It states that there will be a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (jahannam). 　The Five Pillars—considered obligatory acts of worship—comprise the Islamic oath and creed (shahada); daily prayers (salah); almsgiving (zakat); fasting (sawm) in the month of Ramadan; and a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. 　Islamic law, sharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to men's and women's roles and the environment. 　Prominent religious festivals include Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. 　The three holiest sites in Islam in descending order are Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. 　Islam originated in the 7th century in Mecca. 　Muslim rule expanded outside Arabia under the Rashidun Caliphate and the subsequent Umayyad Caliphate ruled from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indus Valley. 　In the Islamic Golden Age, mostly during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, much of the Muslim world experienced a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. 　The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and religious conversion as a result of Islamic missionary activities (dawah), and through conquests. 　There are two major Islamic denominations: Sunni Islam (85–90%) and Shia Islam (10–15%). 　While Sunni–Shia differences initially arose from disagreements over the succession to Muhammad, they grew to cover a broader dimension, both theologically and juridically. 　Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. 　Approximately 12% of the world's Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country; 31% live in South Asia; 20% live in the Middle East–North Africa; and 15% live in sub-Saharan Africa. 　Sizable Muslim communities are also present in the Americas, China, and Europe. 　Due largely to a higher fertility rate, Islam is the world's fastest growing major religious group, and is projected to be the world's largest religion by the end of the 21st century.

<font size=3>
Corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. 　Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and the embezzlement and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries. 　Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts with an official capacity for personal gain. 　Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states.　[citation needed] Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions. 　Recent data suggests corruption is on the rise. 　Each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime. 　Strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. 　Additionally, global initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms.
