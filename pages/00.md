The (/ðə, ðiː/ (listen)) is a grammatical article in English, denoting persons or things already mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers. 　It is the definite article in English. 　The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words. 　It is derived from gendered articles in Old English which combined in Middle English and now has a single form used with pronouns of any gender. 　The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter. 　This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers.

As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last<br> defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it<br> as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to<br> go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my<br> utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost<br> constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no<br> prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or<br> subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's<br> country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the<br> infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed<br> the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.<br> xi. 8).<br>prep.

A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. 　Its name in English is a (pronounced /ˈeɪ/), plural aes. 　It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. 　The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. 　The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. 　The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. 　In English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", are indefinite articles.

<font size=3>
That is an English language word used for several grammatical purposes. 　These include use as an adjective, conjunction, pronoun, adverb, and intensifier; it has distance from the speaker, as opposed to words like this. 　The word did not originally exist in Old English, and its concept was represented by þe. 　Once it came into being, it was spelt as þæt (among others, such as þet), taking the role of the modern that. 　It also took on the role of the modern word what, though this has since changed, and that has recently replaced some usage of the modern which. 　Pronunciation of the word varies according to its role within a sentence, with two main varieties (a strong and a weak form), though there are also regional differences, such as where the /ð/ sound is substituted instead by a /d/ in English spoken in Cameroon.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time>Time</a> 

<font size=3>
Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. 　It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. 　Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions. 　Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. 　Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. 　Time in physics is operationally defined as "what a clock reads". 　The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime. 　Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. 　Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). 　However, the numerical values are different for different observers. 　In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. 　Distance and time are intimately related, and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. 　General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. 　At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity. 　Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. 　The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. 　Time is used to define other quantities, such as velocity, so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. 　An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. 　To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted. 　The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of time is. 　It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. 　Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. 　General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. 　Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes. 　Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. 　Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. 　Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the swing of a pendulum. 　Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("time is money") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans. 　There are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. 　In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well>Well</a> 

<font size=3>
A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. 　The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers. 　The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets or large water bags that are raised mechanically or by hand. 　Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well. 　Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India. 　Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age. 　Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world. 　These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. 　A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. 　Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. 　Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. 　Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. 　Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells. 　Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. 　A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. 　The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. 　Water may be pumped or hand drawn. 　Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. 　Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. 　Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. 　Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(sociology)>Will (sociology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In sociology, will is a concept introduced by Ferdinand Tönnies in "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft", 1887. 　Tönnies' approach was very much indebted to Spinoza's dictum voluntas atque intellectus unum et idem sunt ("will as well as ratio are one and the same"), and to Arthur Schopenhauer. 　Tönnies saw a fundamental cleavage between "essential will" (Wesenwille) creating community (Gemeinschaft), and "arbitrary will" (Kürwille), creating society (Gesellschaft) - see Ferdinand Tönnies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May>May</a> 

<font size=3>
May is the fifth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the third of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　May is a month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. 　Therefore, May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. 　Late May typically marks the start of the summer vacation season in the United States (Memorial Day) and Canada (Victoria Day) that ends on Labor Day, the first Monday of September. 　May (in Latin, Maius) was named for the Greek goddess Maia, who was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility, Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May. 　Conversely, the Roman poet Ovid provides a second etymology, in which he says that the month of May is named for the maiores, Latin for "elders," and that the following month (June) is named for the iuniores, or "young people" (Fasti VI.88). 　Eta Aquariids meteor shower appears in May. 　It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 　6. The Arietids shower from May 22 – July 2, and peaks on June 　7. The Virginids also shower at various dates in May.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School>School</a> 

<font size=3>
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. 　Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. 　In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. 　The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. 　An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university. 　In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. 　Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). 　University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. 　A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. 　Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods. 　Non-government schools, also known as private schools, may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. 　Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. 　Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools. 　Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives, of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others, of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity, and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn. 　In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively. 　Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World>World</a> 

<font size=3>
In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. 　The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. 　Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". 　Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. 　In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". 　Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. 　Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". 　In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. 　Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. 　In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. 　A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. 　Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world. 　In various contexts, the term "world" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope. 　In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents. 　Other examples include terms such as "world religion", "world language", "world government", "world war", "world population", "world economy" or "world championship".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year>Year</a> 

<font size=3>
A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. 　Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. 　In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. 　In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked. 　A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. 　The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars. 　For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days (97 out of 400 years are leap years). 　In English, the unit of time for year is commonly abbreviated as "y" or "yr". 　The symbol "a" is more common in scientific literature, though its exact duration may be inconsistent. 　In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. 　The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. 　Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. 　The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City>City</a> 

<font size=3>
A city is a human settlement of notable size. 　It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. 　Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. 　Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. 　Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. 　Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. 　However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. 　This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and global health. 　Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. 　Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. 　Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change. 　However, this concentration can also have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources. 　Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. 　For example, country capitals such as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex of their respective nations. 　Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto and Xi'an, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. 　Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Haridwar and Prayagraj each hold significance.

<font size=3>
The second (symbol: s) is the unit of time in the International System of Units (SI), historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each (24 × 60 × 60 = 86400). 　The current and formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is more precise: The second [...] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1. 　This current definition was adopted in 1967 when it became feasible to define the second based on fundamental properties of nature with caesium clocks. 　Because the speed of Earth's rotation varies and is slowing ever so slightly, a leap second is added at irregular intervals to civil time to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day>Day</a> 

<font size=3>
A day is the time period of a full rotation of the Earth with respect to the Sun. 　On average, this is 24 hours, 1440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds. 　In everyday life, the word "day" often refers to a solar day, which is the length between two solar noons or times the Sun reaches the highest point. 　The word "day" may also refer to daytime, a time period when the location receives direct and indirect sunlight. 　On Earth, as a location passes through its day, it experiences morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. 　The effect of a day is vital to many life processes, which is called the circadian rhythm. 　A collection of sequential days is organized into calendars as dates, almost always into weeks, months and years. 　Most calendars' arrangement of dates use either or both the Sun with its four seasons (solar calendar) or the Moon's phasing (lunar calendar). 　The start of a day is commonly accepted as roughly the time of the middle of the night or midnight, written as 00:00 or 12:00 am in 24- or 12-hour clocks, respectively. 　Because the time of midnight varies between locations, time zones are set up to facilitate the use of a uniform standard time. 　Midnight is not the only convention used to determine the start of a new day. 　Other defining moments have been used throughout history, and some are used even today, such as with the Jewish religious calendar, which counts days from sunset to sunset, so the Jewish Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday. 　Astronomers also have a convention where their day begins at high noon. 　This way, all of their observations throughout a single night are recorded as happening on the same day. 　This method removes ambiguity of a particular observation happening on a calendar day, eliminating the need to further determine which night it happened on. 　Because when using midnight as the start of day, each calendar day is associated with two separate night periods. 　In specific applications, the definition of a day is slightly modified, such as in the ISQ day (exactly 86,400 seconds) used for computers and standards keeping, local mean time accounting of the Earth's natural fluctuation of a solar day, and stellar day and sidereal day (using the celestial sphere) used for astronomy. 　In most countries outside of the tropics, daylight saving time is practiced, and each year there will be one 23-hour civil day and one 25-hour civil day. 　Due to slight variations in the rotation of the Earth, there are rare times when a leap second will get inserted at the end of a UTC day, and so while almost all days have a duration of 86,400 seconds, there are these exceptional cases of a day with 86,401 seconds (in the half-century spanning 1972 through 2022, there have been a total of 27 leap seconds that have been inserted, so roughly once every other year).

<font size=3>
A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor. 　It still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale. 　Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol.

<font size=3>
A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste. 　Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. 　Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. 　In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissue concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. 　Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head.

<font size=3>
In hydrology, the head is the point on a watercourse up to which it has been artificially broadened and/or raised by an impoundment. 　Above the head of the reservoir natural conditions prevail; below it the water level above the riverbed has been raised by the impoundment and its flow rate reduced, unless and until banks, barrages, weir sluices or dams are overcome (overtopped), whereby a less frictional than natural course will exist (mid-level and surface rather than bed and bank currents) resulting in flash flooding below. 　In principle, a distinction must be drawn between the head of a reservoir impounded by a dam, and the head of a works resulting from a barrage or canal locks.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(geology)>Head (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Head describes deposits consisting of fragmented material which, following weathering, have moved downslope through a process of solifluction. 　The term has been used by British geologists since the middle of the 19th century to describe such material in a range of different settings from flat hilltops to the bottoms of valleys. 　Areas identified as head include deposits of aeolian origin such as blown sand and loess, slope deposits such as gelifluctates and solifluctates, and recently eroded soil material, called colluvium. 　With geologists becoming more interested in studying the near-surface environment and its related processes, the term head is becoming obsolete. 　A related term is 'combe (or coombe) rock', descriptive of a body of chalk and flint fragments contained within a mass of chalky earth typically found on the chalk downlands of south-east England and resulting from freeze-thaw processes. 　Where the mass is also soliflucted, it is considered a variety of head. 　Though its earliest use is attributed to De la Beche in 1839 he mentions that in 1837 Mr. Trevelyn of Guernsey observed “ a bed of disintegrated granite, about three feet thick, mixed with angular fragments, thus reminding us of the head of angular fragments so commonly seen in Cornwall and Devon.　“

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man>Man</a> 

<font size=3>
A man is an adult male human. 　Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). 　Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. 　Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. 　During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. 　These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition. 　Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, and by secondary sex characteristics, including a narrower pelvis, narrower hips, and smaller breasts without mammary glands. 　Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited men's activities and opportunities. 　Men often face conscription into military service or are directed into professions with high mortality rates, resulting in a shorter life expectancy than women. 　Many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for men, such as forced circumcision. 　Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence. 　Trans men have a gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, while intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology.

A team is a group of individuals (human or non-human) working together to achieve their goal. 　As defined by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management, "[a] team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a common goal". 　A group does not necessarily constitute a team. 　Teams normally have members with complementary skills and generate synergy through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. 　Naresh Jain (2009) claims: Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations. 　While academic research on teams and teamwork has grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase over the past recent 40 years, the societal diffusion of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile trend in the 20th century. 　The concept was introduced into business in the late 20th century, which was followed by a popularization of the concept of constructing teams. 　Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new management fad. 　Some see "team" as a four-letter word: overused and under-useful. 　Others see it as a panacea that realizes the Human Relations Movement's desire to integrate what that movement perceives as best for workers and as best for managers. 　Many people believe in the effectiveness of teams, but also see them as dangerous because of the potential for exploiting workers — in that team effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer surveillance. 　However, Hackman sees team effectiveness not only in terms of performance: a truly effective team will contribute to the personal well-being and adaptive growth of its members. 　English-speakers commonly use the word "team" in today's society to characterise many types of groups. 　Peter Guy Northouse's book Leadership: theory and practice discusses teams from a leadership perspective. 　According to the team approach to leadership, a team is a type of organizational group of people that are members.　[citation needed] A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. 　A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. 　A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization, company, or community. 　Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties. 　A team's communication is significantly important to their relationship.　[citation needed] Ergo, communication is frequent and persistent, and as well are the meetings.　[citation needed] The definition of team as an organizational group is not completely set in stone, as organizations have confronted a myriad[quantify] of new forms of contemporary collaboration. 　Teams usually have strong organizational structured platforms and respond quickly and efficiently to challenges as they have skills and the capability to do so.　[citation needed] An effective organizational team leads to greater productivity, more effective implementation of resources, better decisions and problem-solving, better-quality products/service, and greater innovation and originality.　[citation needed] Alongside the concept of a team, compare the more structured/skilled concept of a crew, the advantages of formal and informal partnerships, or the well-defined – but time-limited – existence of task forces. 　A team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members. 　Thus teams of game players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport. 　Transport logistics executives can select teams of horses, dogs, or oxen for the purpose of conveying passengers or goods.

<font size=3>
Family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). 　The purpose of the family is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. 　Ideally, families offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and learn to participate in the community. 　Historically, most human societies use family as the primary locus of attachment, nurturance, and socialization. 　Anthropologists classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children), patrifocal (a father and his children), conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family), avuncular (a man, his sister, and her children), or extended (in addition to parents and children, may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins). 　The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history. 　The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics. 　The word "families" can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village.

<font size=3>
Family (Latin: familia, plural familiae) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. 　It is classified between order and genus. 　A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. 　The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as the "walnut family". 　What belongs to a family—or if a described family should be recognized at all—are proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists. 　There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family, but in plants, they can be characterized on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. 　Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions, and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time. 　The publishing of new data and opinions often enables adjustments and consensus.

<font size=3>
A house is a single-unit residential building. 　It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. 　Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space. 　Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers. 　Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. 　A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room. 　Some large houses in North America have a recreation room. 　In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans. 　The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household. 　Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals. 　Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. 　A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools. 　A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.

War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. 　It is generally characterized by extreme violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. 　Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. 　Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. 　While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life>Life</a> 

<font size=3>
Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not, and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction. 　Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. 　Biology is the science that studies life. 　The gene is the unit of heredity, whereas the cell is the structural and functional unit of life. 　There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. 　Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells and passes its genes onto a new generation, sometimes producing genetic variation. 　Organisms, or the individual entities of life, are generally thought to be open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve over multiple generations. 　Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids, but they are usually excluded because they do not function on their own; rather, they exploit the biological processes of hosts. 　Abiogenesis, also known as the origin of life, is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. 　Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions. 　New lifeforms have evolved from common ancestors through hereditary variation and natural selection, and today, estimates of the number of distinct species range anywhere from 3 million to over 100 million. 　Death is the permanent termination of all biological processes which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. 　Extinction is the term describing the dying-out of a group or taxon, usually a species. 　Once extinct, the extinct species or taxon cannot come back to life. 　Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.

<font size=3>
A name is a term used for identification by an external observer. 　They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. 　The entity identified by a name is called its referent. 　A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. 　The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. 　Other nouns are sometimes called "common names" or (obsolete) "general names". 　A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number>Number</a> 

<font size=3>
A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. 　The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. 　Numbers can be represented in language with number words. 　More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, "5" is a numeral that represents the number five. 　As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. 　The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. 　In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). 　In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents. 　In mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0), negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half ( 1 2 ) {\displaystyle \left({\tfrac {1}{2}}\right)} , real numbers such as the square root of 2 ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {2}}\right)} and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). 　Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. 　Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers. 　Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. 　For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and "a million" may signify "a lot" rather than an exact quantity. 　Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. 　Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today. 　During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. 　Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. 　In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as rings and fields, and the application of the term "number" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.

R, or r, is the eighteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. 　Its name in English is ar (pronounced /ˈɑːr/), plural ars, or in Ireland or /ˈɔːr/. 　The letter ⟨r⟩ is the eighth most common letter in English and the fourth-most common consonant (after ⟨t⟩, ⟨n⟩, and ⟨s⟩). 　The letter ⟨r⟩ is used to form the ending "-re", which is used in certain words such as centre in some varieties of English spelling, such as British English. 　Canadian English also uses the "-re" ending, unlike American English, where the ending is usually replaced by "-er" (center). 　This does not affect pronunciation.

Following is a 1998 independent neo-noir crime thriller film written, produced, edited and directed by Christopher Nolan. 　It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. 　As Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make. 　Scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed to economise on 16mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. 　Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. 　Along with writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production. 　The film was released by The Criterion Collection on both Blu-ray and DVD in North America on 11 December 2012.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season>Season</a> 

<font size=3>
A season is a division of the year based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of daylight hours in a given region. 　On Earth, seasons are the result of the axial parallelism of Earth's tilted orbit around the Sun. 　In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. 　Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies. 　The Northern Hemisphere experiences most direct sunlight during May, June, and July, as the hemisphere faces the Sun. 　The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. 　It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. 　However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. 　In temperate and sub-polar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter. 　Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal. 　Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season. 　Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season. 　"Seasons" can also be dictated by the timing of important ecological events such as hurricane season, tornado season, and wildfire season.　[citation needed] Some examples of historical importance are the ancient Egyptian seasons—flood, growth, and low water—which were previously defined by the former annual flooding of the Nile in Egypt. 　Seasons often hold special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolve around planting and harvest times, and the change of seasons is often attended by ritual. 　The definition of seasons is also cultural. 　In India, from ancient times to the present day, six seasons or Ritu based on south Asian religious or cultural calendars are recognised and identified for purposes such as agriculture and trade.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state. 　In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. 　Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. 　In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. 　While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations. 　The major types of political systems in the modern era are democracies, monarchies, authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. 　Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny. 　These forms are not always mutually exclusive, and mixed governments are common. 　The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession.

<font size=3>
In topology, a branch of mathematics, the ends of a topological space are, roughly speaking, the connected components of the "ideal boundary" of the space. 　That is, each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to infinity within the space. 　Adding a point at each end yields a compactification of the original space, known as the end compactification. 　The notion of an end of a topological space was introduced by Hans Freudenthal (1931).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area>Area</a> 

<font size=3>
Area is the measure of a region's size on a surface. 　The area of a plane region or plane area refers to the area of a shape or planar lamina, while surface area refers to the area of an open surface or the boundary of a three-dimensional object. 　Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. 　It is the two-dimensional analogue of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). 　The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. 　In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long. 　A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares. 　In mathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number. 　There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles. 　Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles. 　For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area. 　Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus. 　For a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area. 　Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus. 　Area plays an important role in modern mathematics. 　In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra, and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry. 　In analysis, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure, though not every subset is measurable. 　In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions. 　Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. 　It can be proved that such a function exists.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand>Hand</a> 

<font size=3>
A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. 　A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having "hands" instead of paws on their front limbs. 　The raccoon is usually described as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking. 　Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally—for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand. 　The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. 　It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. 　The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. 　Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones. 　Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback. 　They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands. 　Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning. 　Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language. 　Likewise, the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.

<font size=3>
A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans, and sometimes various companion animals. 　It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. 　Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. 　Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space. 　The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet. 　The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines – topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics. 　The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.　[citation needed] The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.

<font size=3>
Order (Latin: ordo) is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. 　It is classified between family and class. 　In biological classification, the order is a taxonomic rank used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the nomenclature codes. 　An immediately higher rank, superorder, is sometimes added directly above order, with suborder directly beneath order. 　An order can also be defined as a group of related families. 　What does and does not belong to each order is determined by a taxonomist, as is whether a particular order should be recognized at all. 　Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a different position. 　There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing or recognizing an order. 　Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognized only rarely. 　The name of an order is usually written with a capital letter. 　For some groups of organisms, their orders may follow consistent naming schemes. 　Orders of plants, fungi, and algae use the suffix -ales (e.g. Dictyotales). 　Orders of birds and fishes use the Latin suffix -(i)formes meaning 'having the form of' (e.g. Passeriformes), but orders of mammals and invertebrates are not so consistent (e.g. Artiodactyla, Actiniaria, Primates).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music>Music</a> 

<font size=3>
Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. 　Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal. 　While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions. 　The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. 　Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice. 　In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. 　For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. 　In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a changing set of notes. 　In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. 　Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated electronically from many performances. 　Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. 　Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones. 　Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. 　The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. 　Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.

<font size=3>
In psychology, a set is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. 　A perceptual set, also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. 　Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. 　They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. 　A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem. 　It can be shaped by habit or by desire. 　Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game>Game</a> 

<font size=3>
A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool. 　Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). 　Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. 　They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. 　The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. 　On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. 　Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. 　A toy and a game are not the same. 　Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules. 　Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction[disambiguation needed]. 　Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. 　Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. 　Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures. 　The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.

In Greek mythology, Side (Ancient Greek: Σίδη 'pomegranate) or Sida was the name of the following figures: Sida, eponym of the city of Sidon in Phoenicia. 　She was the wife of Belus, king of Egypt and mother of Aegyptus and Danaus. 　Otherwise, the wife of Belus was called Achiroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus. 　Side, one of the Danaïdes, condemned to Tartarus for murdering her husband. 　From her, a town in Laconia was believed to derived its name from. 　Side, the first wife of Orion and mother of his daughters Metioche and Menippe. 　She was cast by Hera into Hades because she rivaled the goddess in beauty. 　Modern scholars interpret the supposed marriage of Orion to Side ('pomegranate') as a mythical expression for the ripening of the fruit in the season when the constellation Orion is visible in the night sky. 　Side, a mortal woman who was chased down by her father Ictinus, intending to rape her. 　Side killed herself on her mother's grave, and the gods turned her blood into a pomegranate tree. 　Her father was changed into a kite bird that never rested on pomegranate trees.

In public relations and communication science, publics are groups of individual people, and the public (a.k.a. the general public) is the totality of such groupings. 　This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the Öffentlichkeit or public sphere. 　The concept of a public has also been defined in political science, psychology, marketing, and advertising. 　In public relations and communication science, it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field. 　Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, and suffered more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder.

<font size=3>
A came is a divider bar used between small pieces of glass to make a larger glazing panel. 　There are two kinds of came: the H-shaped sections that hold two pieces together and the U-shaped sections that are used for the borders. 　Cames are mostly made of lead, zinc, copper, brass or brass-capped lead. 　Of the metal strips, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. 　The harder metals are used to work with slightly curved lines and pieces that require greater structural support. 　They can also be used as border came, once again for stability and support.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County>County</a> 

<font size=3>
A county is a geographic region of a country used for administrative or other purposes in certain modern nations. 　The term is derived from the Old French comté denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. 　Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of "count", are now seldom used officially, including comté, contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, graafschap, and zhupa in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to commune/community are now often instead used. 　When the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. 　The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England, calling them shires; many county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word shire added on: for example, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. 　The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms "count" and "county" under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent. 　Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word sċīr ([ʃiːr]) or, in Modern English, shire – an equivalent administrative division of the kingdom. 　The term "county" evolved, consequently, to designate a level of local administration that was immediately beneath a national government, within a unitary (non-federal) system of government. 　County later also became used differently in some federal systems of government, for a local administrative division subordinate to a primary subnational entity, such as a Province (e.g. Canada) or a level 3 territorial unit (NUTS 3). 　In the United States and Canada, founded 600 years later on the British traditions, counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations, which in governance have certain officeholders (for example sheriffs and their departments) as a part of the state and provincial mechanisms, including geographically common court systems. 　A county may be further subdivided into districts, hundreds, townships or other administrative jurisdictions within the county. 　A county usually, but not always, contains cities, towns, townships, villages, or other municipal corporations, which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments. 　Depending on the nation, municipality, and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control — the functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated. 　Outside English-speaking countries, an equivalent of the term county is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government; but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.

<font size=3>
A model is an informative representation of an object, person or system. 　The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin modulus, a measure. 　Models can be divided into physical models (e.g. a model plane) and abstract models (e.g. mathematical expressions describing behavioural patterns). 　Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science, as almost every scientific theory effectively embeds some kind of model of the physical or human sphere. 　In commerce, "model" can refer to a specific design of a product as displayed in a catalogue or show room (e.g. Ford Model T), and by extension to the sold product itself. 　Types of models include:

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Want>Want</a> 

<font size=3>
The idea of want can be examined from many perspectives. 　In secular societies want might be considered similar to the emotion desire, which can be studied scientifically through the disciplines of psychology or sociology. 　Want might also be examined in economics as a necessary ingredient in sustaining and perpetuating capitalist societies that are organised around principles like consumerism. 　Alternatively want can be studied in a non-secular, spiritual, moralistic or religious way, particularly by Buddhism but also Christianity, Islam and Judaism. 　In economics, a want is something that is desired. 　It is said that every person has unlimited wants, but limited resources (economics is based on the assumption that only limited resources are available to us). 　Thus, people cannot have everything they want and must look for the most affordable alternatives. 　Wants are often distinguished from needs. 　A need is something that is necessary for survival (such as food and shelter), whereas a want is simply something that a person would like to have. 　Some economists have rejected this distinction and maintain that all of these are simply wants, with varying levels of importance. 　By this viewpoint, wants and needs can be understood as examples of the overall concept of demand. 　Examples of wants that people would like to have is financial monitoring, saving time, higher paying job, more comfort, healthier diet, physical fitness, spirituality, friendship, companionship and safety.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought>Thought</a> 

<font size=3>
In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. 　Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. 　But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. 　These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. 　But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. 　In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes. 　Various theories of thinking have been proposed, some of which aim to capture the characteristic features of thought. 　Platonists hold that thinking consists in discerning and inspecting Platonic forms and their interrelations. 　It involves the ability to discriminate between the pure Platonic forms themselves and the mere imitations found in the sensory world. 　According to Aristotelianism, to think about something is to instantiate in one's mind the universal essence of the object of thought. 　These universals are abstracted from sense experience and are not understood as existing in a changeless intelligible world, in contrast to Platonism. 　Conceptualism is closely related to Aristotelianism: it identifies thinking with mentally evoking concepts instead of instantiating essences. 　Inner speech theories claim that thinking is a form of inner speech in which words are silently expressed in the thinker's mind. 　According to some accounts, this happens in a regular language, like English or French. 　The language of thought hypothesis, on the other hand, holds that this happens in the medium of a unique mental language called Mentalese. 　Central to this idea is that linguistic representational systems are built up from atomic and compound representations and that this structure is also found in thought. 　Associationists understand thinking as the succession of ideas or images. 　They are particularly interested in the laws of association that govern how the train of thought unfolds. 　Behaviorists, by contrast, identify thinking with behavioral dispositions to engage in public intelligent behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli. 　Computationalism is the most recent of these theories. 　It sees thinking in analogy to how computers work in terms of the storage, transmission, and processing of information. 　Various types of thinking are discussed in the academic literature. 　A judgment is a mental operation in which a proposition is evoked and then either affirmed or denied. 　Reasoning, on the other hand, is the process of drawing conclusions from premises or evidence. 　Both judging and reasoning depend on the possession of the relevant concepts, which are acquired in the process of concept formation. 　In the case of problem solving, thinking aims at reaching a predefined goal by overcoming certain obstacles. 　Deliberation is an important form of practical thought that consists in formulating possible courses of action and assessing the reasons for and against them. 　This may lead to a decision by choosing the most favorable option. 　Both episodic memory and imagination present objects and situations internally, in an attempt to accurately reproduce what was previously experienced or as a free rearrangement, respectively. 　Unconscious thought is thought that happens without being directly experienced. 　It is sometimes posited to explain how difficult problems are solved in cases where no conscious thought was employed. 　Thought is discussed in various academic disciplines. 　Phenomenology is interested in the experience of thinking. 　An important question in this field concerns the experiential character of thinking and to what extent this character can be explained in terms of sensory experience. 　Metaphysics is, among other things, interested in the relation between mind and matter. 　This concerns the question of how thinking can fit into the material world as described by the natural sciences. 　Cognitive psychology aims to understand thought as a form of information processing. 　Developmental psychology, on the other hand, investigates the development of thought from birth to maturity and asks which factors this development depends on. 　Psychoanalysis emphasizes the role of the unconscious in mental life. 　Other fields concerned with thought include linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, and sociology. 　Various concepts and theories are closely related to the topic of thought. 　The term "law of thought" refers to three fundamental laws of logic: the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the principle of identity. 　Counterfactual thinking involves mental representations of non-actual situations and events in which the thinker tries to assess what would be the case if things had been different. 　Thought experiments often employ counterfactual thinking in order to illustrate theories or to test their plausibility. 　Critical thinking is a form of thinking that is reasonable, reflective, and focused on determining what to believe or how to act. 　Positive thinking involves focusing one's attention on the positive aspects of one's situation and is intimately related to optimism.

<font size=3>
A father is the male parent of a child. 　Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. 　A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. 　A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. 　An adoptive father is a man who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. 　A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. 　A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. 　The adjective "paternal" refers to a father and comparatively to "maternal" for a mother. 　The verb "to father" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun "fathering". 　Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male). 　Related terms of endearment are dad (dada, daddy), baba, papa, pappa, papasita, (pa, pap) and pop. 　A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album>Album</a> 

<font size=3>
An album is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. 　Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm. 　The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. 　Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. 　The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. 　Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. 　The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. 　This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or "mixed" together. 　Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed "live", even when done in a studio. 　Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", have reverberation, which creates a "live" sound. 　Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. 　With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track. 　Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. 　Historically, the term "album" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. 　In musical usage, the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. 　Later, collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). 　When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an "album"; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law>Law</a> 

<font size=3>
Law is a set of rules that are created and are enforceable by social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior, with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate. 　It has been variously described as a science and as the art of justice. 　State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions. 　Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation. 　The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. 　The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people. 　Legal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law. 　In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. 　In common law systems, judges may make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. 　Historically, religious law has influenced secular matters and is, as of the 21st century, still in use in some religious communities. 　Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. 　The scope of law can be divided into two domains. 　Public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law. 　Private law deals with legal disputes between individuals and/or organisations in areas such as contracts, property, torts/delicts and commercial law. 　This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions. 　Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. 　Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice.

<font size=3>
Black is a color which results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. 　It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and grey. 　It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness. 　Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. 　Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates. 　Black was one of the first colors used by artists in Neolithic cave paintings. 　It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld. 　In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches, and magic. 　In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges, and government officials in much of Europe. 　It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century. 　According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, fear, evil, and elegance. 　Black is the most common ink color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus is the easiest color to read. 　Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens. 　As of September 2019, the darkest material is made by MIT engineers from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes.

A body (Latin: corpus) is the physical material of an organism. 　It is only used for organisms which are in one part or whole. 　There are organisms which change from single cells to whole organisms: for example, slime molds. 　For them the term 'body' would mean the multicellular stage. 　Other uses: Plant body: plants are modular , with modules being created by meristems and the body generally consisting of both the shoot system and the root system, with the body's development being influenced by its environment. 　Cell body: here it may be used for cells like neurons which have long axons (nerve fibres). 　The cell body is the part with the nucleus in it. 　The body of a dead person is also called a corpse or cadaver. 　The dead bodies of vertebrate animals and insects are sometimes called carcasses. 　The human body has a head, neck, torso, two arms, two legs and the genitals of the groin, which differ between males and females. 　The branch of biology dealing with the study of the bodies and their specific structural features called morphology. 　Anatomy is a branch of morphology that deals with the structure of the body at a level higher than tissue. 　Anatomy is closely related to histology, which studies the structure of tissues, as well as cytology, which studies the structure and function of the individual cells, from which the tissues and organs of the studied macroorganism are built. 　Taken together, anatomy, histology, cytology and embryology represent a morphology The study of functions and mechanisms in a body is physiology.

Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. 　It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). 　It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food, energy or organic micronutrients. 　Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. 　The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°. 　"Water" is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard temperature and pressure. 　Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, a number of natural states of water exist on earth. 　It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. 　Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. 　When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. 　The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. 　Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, with seas and oceans making up most of the water volume on earth (about 96.5%). 　Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). 　Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. 　Water plays an important role in the world economy. 　Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. 　Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein. 　Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. 　Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. 　Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. 　Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building>Building</a> 

<font size=3>
A building, or edifice, is an enclosed structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory (although there's also portable buildings). 　Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, prestige, and aesthetic reasons. 　To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures. 　Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. 　A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful). 　Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. 　In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River>River</a> 

<font size=3>
A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater stream, flowing on the surface or inside caves towards another waterbody at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, sea, bay, lake, wetland or another river. 　In some cases, a river flows into the ground or becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. 　Small rivers can be referred to using names such as creek, brook and rivulet. 　There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. 　Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" in Scotland and Northeast England, and "beck" in Northern England. 　Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. 　Rivers are an important part of the water cycle. 　Water from a drainage basin generally collects into a river through surface runoff from precipitation, meltwater released from natural ice and snowpacks, and other underground sources such as groundwater recharge and springs. 　Rivers are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. 　Rivers are also an important natural terraformer, as the erosive action of running water with carve out rills, gullies and valleys in the surface, as well as transferring silt and dissolved minerals downstream, forming river deltas and islands where the flow slows down. 　As a waterbody, rivers also serve crucial ecological functions by providing and feeding habitats for aquatic and semiaquatic animals and plants, especially for migratory fish species. 　Rivers are significant to mankind since many human settlements and civilizations are built around sizeable rivers and streams. 　Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are (or were) depended upon as a vital source of drinking water, for food supply via fishing and agricultural irrigation, for shipping, as natural borders and/or defensive terrains, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery or generate electricity, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste. 　In the pre-industrial era, larger rivers were a major obstacle to movement of people, goods, and armies across regions. 　Towns often developed at the few locations suitable for fording, to build bridges or to support ports, and many major cities such as London are located at the narrowest and most reliable site at which a river could be crossed via bridges or ferries. 　In Earth science disciplines, potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.

York is a cathedral city in North Yorkshire, England, with Roman origins, sited at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss. 　It is the historic county town of Yorkshire. 　The city has many historic buildings and other structures, such as a minster, castle, and city walls. 　It is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider City of York district. 　The city was founded under the name of Eboracum in 71 AD. 　It then became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria, and Scandinavian York. 　In the Middle Ages, it became the northern England ecclesiastical province's centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre. 　In the 19th century, it became a major railway network hub and confectionery manufacturing centre. 　During the Second World War, part of the Baedeker Blitz bombed the city; it was less affected by the war than other northern cities, with several historic buildings being gutted and restored up to the 1960s. 　The city is one of 15 in England to have a lord mayor, and one of two to have The Right Honourable title affixed, the other being London's. 　Historic governance of the city was as a county corporate, not included in the county's riding system. 　The city has since been covered by a municipal borough, county borough, and since 1996 a non-metropolitan district (the City of York), which also includes surrounding villages and rural areas, and the town of Haxby. 　The current district's local council is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout this area. 　The city had a population of 153,717 in the 2011 census; the wider district had a population of 198,100. 　According to 2021[update] census data, the wider district has a population of 202,800, a 2.4% increase compared to the 2011 census.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death>Death</a> 

<font size=3>
Death is the irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. 　For organisms with a brain, death can also be defined as the irreversible cessation of functioning of the whole brain, including brainstem, and brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death. 　The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death. 　Death is an inevitable process that eventually occurs in almost all organisms. 　Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis. 　Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed, but is not said to die. 　As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with ageing being by far the most common cause of death.　[citation needed] Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (heaven, hell, karma).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data>Data</a> 

<font size=3>
In the pursuit of knowledge, data (US: /ˈdætə/; UK: /ˈdeɪtə/) is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted. 　A datum is an individual value in a collection of data. 　Data is usually organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, and which may themselves be used as data in larger structures. 　Data may be used as variables in a computational process. 　Data may represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements. 　Data is commonly used in scientific research, economics, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity. 　Examples of data sets include price indices (such as consumer price index), unemployment rates, literacy rates, and census data. 　In this context, data represents the raw facts and figures which can be used in such a manner in order to capture the useful information out of it. 　Data is collected using techniques such as measurement, observation, query, or analysis, and typically represented as numbers or characters which may be further processed. 　Field data are data that is collected in an uncontrolled in-situ environment. 　Experimental data is data that is generated in the course of a controlled scientific experiment. 　Data is analyzed using techniques such as calculation, reasoning, discussion, presentation, visualization, or other forms of post-analysis. 　Prior to analysis, raw data (or unprocessed data) is typically cleaned: Outliers are removed and obvious instrument or data entry errors are corrected. 　Data can be seen as the smallest units of factual information that can be used as a basis for calculation, reasoning, or discussion. 　Data can range from abstract ideas to concrete measurements, including but not limited to, statistics. 　Thematically connected data presented in some relevant context can be viewed as information. 　Contextually connected pieces of information can then be described as data insights or intelligence. 　The stock of insights and intelligence that accumulates over time resulting from the synthesis of data into information, can then be described as knowledge. 　Data has been described as "the new oil of the digital economy". 　Data, as a general concept, refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing. 　Advances in computing technologies have led to the advent of big data, which usually refers to very large quantities of data, usually at the petabyte scale. 　Using traditional data analysis methods and computing, working with such large (and growing) datasets is difficult, even impossible. 　(Theoretically speaking, infinite data would yield infinite information, which would render extracting insights or intelligence impossible.) 　In response, the relatively new field of data science uses machine learning (and other artificial intelligence (AI)) methods that allow for efficient applications of analytic methods to big data.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court>Court</a> 

<font size=3>
A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. 　In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. 　Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. 　The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary. 　The place where a court sits is known as a venue. 　The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large complex facilities in urban communities. 　The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin iūrisdictiō, from iūris, "of the law," + dīcō, "to declare," + -tiō, noun-forming suffix), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. 　According to William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the āctor or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the reus or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the jūdex or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. 　It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury. 　The term "the court" is also used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges. 　The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as "the bench" (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as "the bar"). 　In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted.

King is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts. 　The female equivalent is queen, which title is also given to the consort of a king, although in some cases, the title of King is given to females such as in the case of Mary, Queen of Hungary. 　In the context of prehistory, antiquity and contemporary indigenous peoples, the title may refer to tribal kingship. 　Germanic kingship is cognate with Indo-European traditions of tribal rulership (c.f. Indic rājan, Gothic reiks, and Old Irish rí, etc.). 　In the context of classical antiquity, king may translate in Latin as rex and in Greek as archon or basileus. 　In classical European feudalism, the title of king as the ruler of a kingdom is understood to be the highest rank in the feudal order, potentially subject, at least nominally, only to an emperor (harking back to the client kings of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire). 　In a modern context, the title may refer to the ruler of one of a number of modern monarchies (either absolute or constitutional). 　The title of king is used alongside other titles for monarchs: in the West, emperor, grand prince, prince, archduke, duke or grand duke, and in the Islamic world, malik, sultan, emir or hakim, etc. 　The city-states of the Aztec Empire had a Tlatoani, which were kings of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. 　The Huey Tlatoani was the emperor of the Aztecs. 　The term king may also refer to a king consort, a title that is sometimes given to the husband of a ruling queen, but the title of prince consort is more common.

<font size=3>
History (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation') is the systematic study and documentation of human activity. 　The time period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory. 　"History" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. 　Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers. 　History is not complete and still has debatable mysteries. 　History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. 　Historians often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. 　Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present. 　Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. 　History differs from myth in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. 　However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. 　The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. 　History is often taught as a part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies. 　Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the "father of history" (as he was one of the first historians) in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the "father of lies". 　Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies. 　Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. 　In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.

<font size=3>
White is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no hue). 　It is the color of objects such as snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. 　White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light. 　White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. 　The color white can be given with white pigments, especially titanium dioxide. 　In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. 　In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. 　It was the royal color of the kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). 　Greek temples and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. 　It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity. 　According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. 　White is an important color for almost all world religions. 　The pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. 　In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. 　In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. 　In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.

September is the ninth month of the year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the third of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the fourth of five months to have a length of fewer than 31 days. 　September in the Northern Hemisphere and March in the Southern Hemisphere are seasonally equivalent. 　In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological autumn is on 1 September. 　In the Southern hemisphere, the beginning of the meteorological spring is on 1 September.　 　September marks the beginning of the ecclesiastical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church. 　It is the start of the academic year in many countries of the northern hemisphere, in which children go back to school after the summer break, sometimes on the first day of the month. 　September (from Latin septem, "seven") was originally the seventh of ten months in the oldest known Roman calendar, the calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC, with March (Latin Martius) the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 451 BC. 　After the calendar reform that added January and February to the beginning of the year, September became the ninth month but retained its name. 　It had 29 days until the Julian reform, which added a day.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book>Book</a> 

<font size=3>
A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. 　The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). 　In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. 　A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. 　As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. 　In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. 　Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. 　In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. 　The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. 　Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. 　In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. 　Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. 　Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats. 　Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. 　An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm". 　A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. 　Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. 　Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. 　In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks. 　Although in most countries printed books continue to outsell their digital counterparts due to many people still preferring to read in a traditional way.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night>Night</a> 

<font size=3>
Night (also described as nighttime, unconventionally spelled as "nite") is the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise during each 24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. 　The exact time when night begins and ends depends on the location and varies throughout the year, based on factors such as season and latitude. 　The word can be used in a different sense as the time between bedtime and morning. 　In common communication, it is a farewell (sometimes lengthened to "good night"), mainly when someone is going to sleep or leaving. 　Astronomical night is the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn when the Sun is between 18 and 90 degrees below the horizon and does not illuminate the sky. 　As seen from latitudes between about 48.56° and 65.73° north or south of the equator, complete darkness does not occur around the summer solstice because, although the Sun sets, it is never more than 18° below the horizon at lower culmination, −90° Sun angles occur at the Tropic of Cancer on the December solstice and Tropic of Capricorn on the June solstice, and at the equator on equinoxes. 　And as seen from latitudes greater than 72° north or south of the equator, complete darkness does not occur in both equinoxes because, although the Sun sets, it is never more than 18° below the horizon. 　The opposite of night is day (or "daytime", to distinguish it from "day" referring to a 24-hour period). 　Twilight is the period of night after sunset or before sunrise when the Sun still illuminates the sky when it is below the horizon. 　At any given time, one side of Earth is bathed in sunlight (the daytime), while the other side is in darkness caused by Earth blocking the sunlight. 　The central part of the shadow is called the umbra, where the night is darkest. 　Natural illumination at night is still provided by a combination of moonlight, planetary light, starlight, zodiacal light, gegenschein, and airglow. 　In some circumstances, aurorae, lightning, and bioluminescence can provide some illumination. 　The glow provided by artificial lighting is sometimes referred to as light pollution because it can interfere with observational astronomy and ecosystems.

Must (from the Latin vinum mustum, "young wine") is freshly crushed fruit juice (usually grape juice) that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit. 　The solid portion of the must is called pomace and typically makes up 7–23% of the total weight of the must. 　Making must is the first step in winemaking. 　Because of its high glucose content, typically between 10 and 15%, must is also used as a sweetener in a variety of cuisines. 　Unlike commercially sold grape juice, which is filtered and pasteurized, must is thick with particulate matter, opaque, and comes in various shades of brown and purple.

<font size=3>
The present (or here and now) is the time that is associated with the events perceived directly and in the first time, not as a recollection (perceived more than once) or a speculation (predicted, hypothesis, uncertain). 　It is a period of time between the past and the future, and can vary in meaning from being an instant to a day or longer. 　It is sometimes represented as a hyperplane in space-time, typically called "now", although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion. 　The present may also be viewed as a duration (see specious present).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species>Species</a> 

<font size=3>
In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity. 　A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. 　Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche. 　In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined. 　The most recent rigorous estimate for the total number of species of eukaryotes is between 8 and 8.7 million. 　However, only about 14% of these had been described by 2011. 　All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name, a "binomial". 　The first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs. 　The second part is called the specific name or the specific epithet (in botanical nomenclature, also sometimes in zoological nomenclature). 　For example, Boa constrictor is one of the species of the genus Boa, with constrictor being the species' epithet. 　While the definitions given above may seem adequate at first glance, when looked at more closely they represent problematic species concepts. 　For example, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with hybridisation, in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, and in a ring species. 　Also, among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. 　Although none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions, and while the concept of species may not be a perfect model of life, it is still an incredibly useful tool to scientists and conservationists for studying life on Earth, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. 　If species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change. 　This obliges taxonomists to decide, for example, when enough change has occurred to declare that a lineage should be divided into multiple chronospecies, or when populations have diverged to have enough distinct character states to be described as cladistic species. 　Species were seen from the time of Aristotle until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the great chain of being. 　In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time. 　Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species explained how species could arise by natural selection. 　That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology. 　Genetic variability arises from mutations and recombination, while organisms themselves are mobile, leading to geographical isolation and genetic drift with varying selection pressures. 　Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by horizontal gene transfer; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and polyploidy; and species may become extinct for a variety of reasons. 　Viruses are a special case, driven by a balance of mutation and selection, and can be treated as quasispecies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light>Light</a> 

<font size=3>
Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. 　Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). 　In physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. 　In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. 　The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization. 　Its speed in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. 　Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. 　The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics. 　The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun. 　Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. 　With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need>Need</a> 

<font size=3>
A need is dissatisfaction at a point of time and in a given context. 　Needs are distinguished from wants. 　In the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. 　In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, land, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration. 　When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power, they have the potential to become economic demands. 　Basic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live. 　In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need to socialise or belong to a family unit or group. 　Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, or psychical and subjective, such as the need for self-esteem. 　The concept of "unmet need" arises in relation to needs in a social context which are not being fulfilled. 　Needs and wants are a matter of interest in, and form a common substrate for, the fields of philosophy, biology, psychology, social science, economics, marketing and politics.

<font size=3>
Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. 　There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. 　In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. 　Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. 　Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. 　In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. 　The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. 　The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October>October</a> 

<font size=3>
October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the sixth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　The eighth month in the old calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC, October retained its name (from Latin and Greek ôctō meaning "eight") after January and February were inserted into the calendar that had originally been created by the Romans. 　In Ancient Rome, one of three Mundus patet would take place on October 5, Meditrinalia October 11, Augustalia on October 12, October Horse on October 15, and Armilustrium on October 19. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 　Among the Anglo-Saxons, it was known as Winterfylleth (Ƿinterfylleþ), because at this full moon, winter was supposed to begin. 　October is commonly associated with the season of spring in parts of the Southern Hemisphere, and autumn in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the seasonal equivalent to April in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.

<font size=3>
Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. 　Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 　Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. 　These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as "football codes". 　There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. 　Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. 　The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. 　By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. 　In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 　During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
