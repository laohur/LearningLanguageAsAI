<font size=3>
Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. 　Hydrogen is the lightest element. 　At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. 　It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. 　Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. 　Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. 　Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. 　For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. 　In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. 　The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. 　Hydrogen is nonmetallic (except it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds. 　Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. 　In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. 　The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. 　Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics. 　Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. 　In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former". 　Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. 　A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. 　Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. 　It can be burned to produce heat or combined with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly, with water being the only emissions at the point of usage. 　Hydrogen atoms (but not gaseous molecules) are problematic in metallurgy because they can embrittle many metals.

<font size=3>
Survival, or the act of surviving, is the propensity of something to continue existing, particularly when this is done despite conditions that might kill or destroy it. 　The concept can be applied to humans and other living things (or, hypothetically, any sentient being), to physical object, and to abstract things such as beliefs or ideas. 　Living things generally have a self-preservation instinct to survive, while objects intended for use in harsh conditions are designed for survivability.

<font size=3>
A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper class country house. 　Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably. 　After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. 　Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages into elegant upper-class country homes. 　In the Early Modern period, any comfortable detached house with a garden near a city or town was likely to be described as a villa; most survivals have now been engulfed by suburbia. 　In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to, in some countries, especially around the Mediterranean, residences of above average size in the countryside.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology>Biology</a> 
<font size=3>
Biology is the scientific study of life. 　It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. 　For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. 　Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. 　Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. 　Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments. 　Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. 　Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. 　Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them. 　Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago, is immensely diverse. 　Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. 　These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar>Radar</a> 
<font size=3>
Radar is a radiolocation system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle (azimuth), and radial velocity of objects relative to the site. 　It is used to detect and track aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, and motor vehicles, and map weather formations, and terrain. 　A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects. 　Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the objects and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects' locations and speeds. 　Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II. 　A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. 　The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for radio detection and ranging. 　The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. 　The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, anti-missile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations. 　Modern high tech radar systems use digital signal processing and machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels. 　Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　One example is lidar, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves. 　With the emergence of driver-less vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration>Immigration</a> 
<font size=3>
Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle as permanent residents or naturalized citizens. 　Commuters, tourists, and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration; seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included, however. 　As for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. 　Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. 　Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent for the scenarios in which 37 to 53 percent of the developing countries' workers migrate to the developed countries. 　Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction. 　Positive net immigration can soften the demographic dilemma in the aging global North. 　The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. 　Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants. 　Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics in the United States and Europe.

Yorkshire (/ˈjɔːrkʃər, -ʃɪər/ YORK-shər, -⁠shihər; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county in northern England and the largest by area size in the United Kingdom. 　Because of its large area in comparison with other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. 　Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographic territory and cultural region. 　The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. 　Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are large stretches of countryside, including the Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors and Peak District national parks. 　Yorkshire has been nicknamed "God's Own Country" by its people. 　The emblem of Yorkshire is the White Rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the white rose on a blue field which, after nearly fifty years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. 　Yorkshire Day, held annually on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its dialect. 　Yorkshire is covered by different Government Office Regions. 　Most of the county falls within Yorkshire and the Humber while the extreme northern part of the county, such as Middlesbrough, Redcar, Holwick and Startforth, falls within North East England. 　Small areas in the west of the county are covered by the North West England region.

A choir (/ˈkwaɪər/ KWIRE; also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. 　Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. 　Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. 　Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures. 　The term choir is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the quire), whereas a chorus performs in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is not rigid. 　Choirs may sing without instruments, or accompanied by a piano, pipe organ, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. 　A choir can be a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the "woodwind choir" of an orchestra, or different "choirs" of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition. 　In typical 18th century to 21st century oratorios and masses, 'chorus' or 'choir' implies that there is more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream>Cream</a> 
<font size=3>
Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. 　In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. 　In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". 　In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. 　It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat. 　Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. 　Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy". 　In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. 　Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. 　Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. 　Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow color. 　Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. 　A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. 　Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers. 　Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. 　Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. 　Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era. 　In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. 　Digital technologies are also affecting the way that consumers pay for goods and services. 　Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services. 　Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services, and the store's overall market positioning. 　Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel, and presentation.

In political and sociological theory, the elite (French: élite, from Latin: eligere, to select or to sort out) are a small group of powerful people who hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, privilege, political power, or skill in a group. 　Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the "elite" are "those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type." 　American sociologist C. Wright Mills states that members of the elite accept their fellows' position of importance in society. 　"As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'." 　It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role.

<font size=3>
Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several bees, the best-known of which are honey bees. 　Honey is made and stored to nourish bee colonies. 　Bees produce honey by gathering and then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. 　This refinement takes place both within individual bees, through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, as well as during storage in the hive, through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until it is thick and viscous. 　Honey bees stockpile honey in the hive. 　Within the hive is a structure made from wax called honeycomb. 　The honeycomb is made up of hundreds or thousands of hexagonal cells, into which the bees regurgitate honey for storage. 　Other honey-producing species of bee store the substance in different structures, such as the pots made of wax and resin used by the stingless bee. 　Honey for human consumption is collected from wild bee colonies, or from the hives of domesticated bees. 　The honey produced by honey bees is the most familiar to humans, thanks to its worldwide commercial production and availability. 　The husbandry of bees is known as beekeeping or apiculture, with the cultivation of stingless bees usually referred to as meliponiculture. 　Honey is sweet because of its high concentrations of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose. 　It has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar). 　One standard tablespoon (15 mL) of honey provides around 190 kilojoules (46 kilocalories) of food energy. 　It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. 　Most microorganisms cannot grow in honey and sealed honey therefore does not spoil. 　Samples of honey discovered in archaeological contexts have proven edible even after thousands of years. 　Honey use and production has a long and varied history, with its beginnings in prehistoric times. 　Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. 　While Apis melifera is an Old World insect, large-scale meliponiculture of New World stingless bees has been practiced by Mayans since pre-Columbian times.

<font size=3>
In astrology, reception is a condition where one planet is located in a sign where a second planet has astrological dignity--for example, a sign which the second planet rules or in which it is exalted, or where the second planet is the triplicity ruler. 　In such a case, the first planet is said to be "received" by the dignified planet, and this relationship was seen by ancient and medieval astrologers to function in a similar way to that of host and guest. 　The dignified planet is strong, and hence provides support and assistance to the second planet which falls within its purview. 　Consider the Sun in Libra. 　Venus is said to 'receive' the Sun because he is visiting her sign. 　In this capacity Venus is known as the Sun's dispositor. 　— Deborah Houlding, Sometimes this relationship is mutual—that is, each planet is in each other's sign of dignity. 　This condition is called mutual reception or "exchange of signs" and can be very beneficial to both planets.

<font size=3>
Christians (/ˈkrɪstʃən, -tiən/ (listen)) are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. 　The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ) (usually rendered as messiah in English). 　While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict, they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance. 　The term Christian used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." 　It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'. 　According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910. 　Today, about 37% of all Christians live in the Americas, about 26% live in Europe, 24% live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 13% live in Asia and the Pacific, and 1% live in the Middle East and North Africa. 　Christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. 　280 million Christians live as a minority. 　About half of all Christians worldwide are Catholic, while more than a third are Protestant (37%). 　Orthodox communions comprise 12% of the world's Christians. 　Other Christian groups make up the remainder. 　By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. 　According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, Christianity will remain the world's largest religion in 2050, if current trends continue. 　In recent history, Christians have experienced persecution of varying severity, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.
