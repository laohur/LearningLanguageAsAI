## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(psychology)>Similarity (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Similarity refers to the psychological degree of identity of two mental representations. 　It is fundamental to human cognition since it provides the basis for categorization of entities into kinds and for various other cognitive processes. 　It underpins our ability to interact with unknown entities by predicting how they will behave based on their similarity to entities we are familiar with. 　Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity. 　Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur>Fur</a> 

<font size=3>
Fur is a thick growth of hair that covers the skin of mammals. 　It consists of a combination of oily guard hair on top and thick underfur beneath. 　The guard hair keeps moisture from reaching the skin; the underfur acts as an insulating blanket that keeps the animal warm. 　The fur of mammals has many uses: protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflaging, with the primary usage being thermoregulation. 　The types of hair include: 99  definitive, which may be shed after reaching a certain length; vibrissae, which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers; pelage, which consists of guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair; spines, which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in, for example, porcupines; bristles, which are long hairs usually used in visual signals, such as the mane of a lion; velli, often called "down fur", which insulates newborn mammals; and wool, which is long, soft, and often curly. 　Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation, as some tropical mammals, such as sloths, have the same fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. 　The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm (12 in) as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F).　: 162–163  Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach 70 °C (158 °F) in the summer, but the skin stays at 40 °C (104 °F).　: 188  Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.　: 162–163  Mammalian coats are colored for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. 　Camouflage is a powerful influence in many mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. 　Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. 　In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. 　Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. 　Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. 　The green coloration of sloths, however, is the result of a symbiotic relationship with algae. 　Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. 　Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. 　Mammals with darker colored coats can absorb more heat from solar radiation and stay warmer; some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. 　The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.　: 166–167  The term pelage – first known use in English c. 　1828 (French, from Middle French, from poil for 'hair', from Old French peilss, from Latin pilus) – is sometimes used to refer to an animal's complete coat. 　The term fur is also used to refer to animal pelts which have been processed into leather with their hair still attached. 　The words fur or furry are also used, more casually, to refer to hair-like growths or formations, particularly when the subject being referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft "hairs". 　If layered, rather than grown as a single coat, it may consist of short down hairs, long guard hairs, and in some cases, medium awn hairs. 　Mammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called "naked", as with the naked mole-rat, or "hairless", as with hairless dogs. 　An animal with commercially valuable fur is known within the fur industry as a furbearer. 　The use of fur as clothing or decoration is controversial; animal welfare advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond>Pond</a> 

<font size=3>
A pond is an area filled with water, either natural or artificial, that is smaller than a lake. 　Defining them to be less than 5 hectares (12 acres) in area, less than 5 meters (16 ft) deep, and with less than 30% emergent vegetation helps in distinguishing their ecology from that of lakes and wetlands.　: 460  Ponds can be created by a wide variety of natural processes (e.g. on floodplains as cutoff river channels, by glacial processes, by peatland formation, in coastal dune systems, by beavers), or they can simply be isolated depressions (such as a kettle hole, vernal pool, prairie pothole, or simply natural undulations in undrained land) filled by runoff, groundwater, or precipitation, or all three of these. 　They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.　: 160–163  The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. 　Ponds may be freshwater or brackish in nature. 　'Ponds' with saltwater, with a direct connection to the sea that maintains full salinity, would normally be regarded as part of the marine environment because they would not support fresh or brackish water organisms, so not really within the realm of freshwater science. 　Ponds are usually by definition quite shallow water bodies with varying abundances of aquatic plants and animals. 　Depth, seasonal water level variations, nutrients fluxes, amount of light reaching the ponds, the shape, the presence of visiting large mammals, the composition of any fish communities and salinity can all affect the types of plant and animal communities present. 　Food webs are based both on free-floating algae and upon aquatic plants. 　There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. 　Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators. 　Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding. 　Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as vernal pools. 　Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes. 　Ponds are frequently manmade or expanded beyond their original depths and bounds by anthropogenic causes. 　Apart from their role as highly biodiverse, fundamentally natural, freshwater ecosystems ponds have had, and still have, many uses, including providing water for agriculture, livestock and communities, aiding in habitat restoration, serving as breeding grounds for local and migrating species, decorative components of landscape architecture, flood control basins, general urbanization, interception basins for pollutants and sources and sinks of greenhouse gases.

<font size=3>
Queens is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Queens County, in the U.S. state of New York. 　Located on Long Island, it is the largest New York City borough by area. 　It is bordered by the borough of Brooklyn at the western tip of Long Island to its west, and Nassau County to its east. 　Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island (via the Rockaways). 　With a population of 2,405,464 as of the 2020 census, Queens is the second-most populous county in New York state, behind Kings County (Brooklyn), and is therefore also the second-most populous of the five New York City boroughs. 　If Queens were a city, it would be the fourth most-populous in the U.S. after New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. 　Queens is the fourth-most densely populated borough in New York City and the fourth-most densely populated U.S. county. 　About 47% of its residents are foreign-born. 　Queens is the most linguistically diverse place on Earth and is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United States. 　Queens was established in 1683 as one of the original 12 counties of the Province of New York. 　The settlement was named after the English Queen and Portuguese royal princess Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705). 　From 1683 to 1899, the County of Queens included what is now Nassau County. 　Queens became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898, combining the towns of Long Island City, Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica, and western Hempstead. 　All except Hempstead are today considered neighborhoods of Queens. 　Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs of New York City. 　It is home to both of New York City's airports: John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia. 　Among its landmarks are Flushing Meadows–Corona Park; Citi Field, home to the New York Mets baseball team; the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, site of the U.S. Open tennis tournament; Kaufman Astoria Studios; Silvercup Studios; and the Aqueduct Racetrack. 　Flushing is undergoing rapid gentrification with investment by Chinese transnational entities, while Long Island City is undergoing gentrification secondary to its proximity across the East River from Manhattan. 　The borough's diverse housing ranges from high-rise apartment buildings in some areas of western and central Queens, such as Ozone Park, Jackson Heights, Flushing, Astoria, and Long Island City; to lower-rise neighborhoods in the eastern part of the borough.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing>Healing</a> 

<font size=3>
With physical trauma or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repairing of damaged tissue(s), organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. 　Medicine includes the process by which the cells in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. 　The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form "like" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. 　Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.　[citation needed] Within surgery, healing is more often referred to as recovery, and postoperative recovery has historically been viewed simply as restitution of function and readiness for discharge. 　More recently, it has been described as an energy‐requiring process to decrease physical symptoms, reach a level of emotional well‐being, regain functions, and re‐establish activities Healing is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.　[citation needed] In psychiatry and psychology, healing is the process by which neuroses and psychoses are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by psychopathological phenomena. 　This process may involve psychotherapy, pharmaceutical treatment or alternative approaches such as traditional spiritual healing.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance>Surveillance</a> 

<font size=3>
Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, many activities, or information for the purpose of information gathering, influencing, managing or directing. 　This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), or interception of electronically transmitted information like Internet traffic. 　It can also include simple technical methods, such as human intelligence gathering and postal interception. 　Surveillance is used by citizens for protecting their neighborhoods. 　And by governments for intelligence gathering - including espionage, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. 　It is also used by criminal organizations to plan and commit crimes, and by businesses to gather intelligence on criminals, their competitors, suppliers or customers. 　Religious organisations charged with detecting heresy and heterodoxy may also carry out surveillance.Auditors carry out a form of surveillance. 　A byproduct of surveillance is that it can unjustifiably violate people's privacy and is often criticized by civil liberties activists. 　Liberal democracies may have laws that seek to restrict governmental and private use of surveillance, whereas authoritarian governments seldom have any domestic restrictions. 　Espionage is by definition covert and typically illegal according to the rules of the observed party, whereas most types of surveillance are overt and are considered legitimate. 　International espionage seems to be common among all types of countries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer>Integer</a> 

<font size=3>
An integer is the number zero (0), a positive natural number (1, 2, 3, etc.) or a negative integer with a minus sign (−1, −2, −3, etc.). 　The negative numbers are the additive inverses of the corresponding positive numbers. 　In the language of mathematics, the set of integers is often denoted by the boldface Z or blackboard bold Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } . 　The set of natural numbers N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } is a subset of Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } , which in turn is a subset of the set of all rational numbers Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } , itself a subset of the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . 　Like the natural numbers, Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is countably infinite. 　An integer may be regarded as a real number that can be written without a fractional component. 　For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5+1/2, and √2 are not. 　The integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers. 　In algebraic number theory, the integers are sometimes qualified as rational integers to distinguish them from the more general algebraic integers. 　In fact, (rational) integers are algebraic integers that are also rational numbers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal>Scandal</a> 

<font size=3>
A scandal can be broadly defined as the strong social reactions of outrage, anger, or surprise, when accusations or rumours circulate or appear for some reason, regarding a person or persons who are perceived to have transgressed in some way. 　These reactions are usually noisy and may be conflicting, and they often have negative effects on the status and credibility of the person(s) or organisation involved. 　Society is scandalised when it becomes aware of breaches of moral norms or legal requirements, often when these have remained undiscovered or been concealed for some time. 　Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust or the abuse of power. 　Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary or artistic but often spread from one realm into another. 　The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. 　In contemporary times, exposure of a scandalous situation is often made by mass media. 　Contemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. 　Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. 　Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and acts detrimental to their establishments. 　However, the possibility of scandal has always created a tension between society's efforts to reveal wrongdoing and its desire to cover them up ... and the act of covering up (or indeed of revealing) a contentious situation may become a scandal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke>Woke</a> 

<font size=3>
Woke (/ˈwoʊk/ WOHK) is an adjective derived from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) meaning "alert to racial prejudice and discrimination". 　Beginning in the 2010s, it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequalities such as sexism, and has also been used as shorthand for American Left ideas involving identity politics and social justice, such as the notion of white privilege and slavery reparations for African Americans. 　The phrase stay woke had emerged in AAVE by the 1930s, in some contexts referring to an awareness of the social and political issues affecting African Americans. 　The phrase was uttered in a recording by Lead Belly and later by Erykah Badu. 　Following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, the phrase was popularised by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists seeking to raise awareness about police shootings of African Americans. 　After seeing use on Black Twitter, the term woke became an Internet meme and was increasingly used by white people, often to signal their support for BLM, which some commentators have criticised as cultural appropriation. 　Mainly associated with the millennial generation, the term spread internationally and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017. 　The terms woke-washing and woke capitalism were coined to describe companies who signal support for progressive causes as a substitute for genuine change. 　By 2020, members of the political center and right wing in several Western countries were using the term woke, often in an ironic way, as an insult for various progressive or leftist movements and ideologies perceived as overzealous, performative, or insincere. 　In turn, some commentators came to consider it an offensive term with negative associations to those who promote political ideas involving identity and race.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit>Lawsuit</a> 

<font size=3>
A lawsuit is a proceeding by one or more parties (the plaintiff or claimant) against one or more parties (the defendant) in a civil court of law. 　The archaic term "suit in law" is found in only a small number of laws still in effect today. 　The term "lawsuit" is used with respect to a civil action brought by a plaintiff (a party who claims to have incurred loss as a result of a defendant's actions) who requests a legal remedy or equitable remedy from a court. 　The defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff's complaint or else risk default judgment. 　If the plaintiff is successful, judgment is entered in favor of the defendant. 　A variety of court orders may be issued in connection with or as part of the judgment to enforce a right, award damages or restitution, or impose a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent an act or compel an act. 　A declaratory judgment may be issued to prevent future legal disputes. 　A lawsuit may involve resolution of disputes involving issues of private law between individuals, business entities or non-profit organizations. 　A lawsuit may also involve issues of public law in the sense that the state is treated as if it were a private party in a civil case, either as a plaintiff with a civil cause of action to enforce certain laws, or as a defendant in actions contesting the legality of the state's laws or seeking monetary damages for injuries caused by agents of the state. 　Conducting a civil action is called litigation. 　The plaintiffs and defendants are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators. 　The term litigation may also refer to the conducting of criminal actions (see criminal procedure).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarantee>Guarantee</a> 

<font size=3>
Guarantee is a legal term more comprehensive and of higher import than either warranty or "security". 　It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for them. 　It may also designate a treaty through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. 　It is to be differentiated from the colloquial "personal guarantee" in that a guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. 　A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of (speak enough) the individual. 　In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. 　At law, the giver of a guarantee is called the surety or the "guarantor". 　The person to whom the guarantee is given is the creditor or the "obligee"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed "the obligor", "the principal debtor", or simply "the principal". 　Suretys have been classified as follows: Those in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the secured creditor is a party; those in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger; those in which, without any such contract of suretyship, there is a primary and a secondary liability of two persons for one and the same debt, the debt being, as between the two, that of one of those persons only, and not equally of both, so that the other, if they should be compelled to pay it, would be entitled to reimbursement from the person by whom (as between the two) it ought to have been paid.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception>Perception</a> 

<font size=3>
Perception (from Latin perceptio 'gathering, receiving') is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information or environment. 　All perception involves signals that go through the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sensory system. 　Vision involves light striking the retina of the eye; smell is mediated by odor molecules; and hearing involves pressure waves. 　Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it is also shaped by the recipient's learning, memory, expectation, and attention. 　Sensory input is a process that transforms this low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). 　The process that follows connects a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as attention) that influence perception. 　Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. 　Since the rise of experimental psychology in the 19th century, psychology's understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques. 　Psychophysics quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception. 　Sensory neuroscience studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. 　Perceptual systems can also be studied computationally, in terms of the information they process. 　Perceptual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver. 　Although people traditionally viewed the senses as passive receptors, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input. 　There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science, or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary. 　The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. 　Human and other animal brains are structured in a modular way, with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. 　Some of these modules take the form of sensory maps, mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. 　These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. 　For instance, taste is strongly influenced by smell.

Coordinates: 44°49′N 20°27′E﻿ / ﻿44.817°N 20.450°E﻿ / 44.817; 20.450 Yugoslavia (/ˌjuːɡoʊˈslɑːviə/; Serbo-Croatian: Jugoslavija / Југославија [juɡǒslaːʋija]; Slovene: Jugoslavija [juɡɔˈslàːʋija]; Macedonian: Југославија [juɡɔˈsɫavija]; lit. 'Land of the South Slavs') was a country in Southeast Europe and Central Europe for most of the 20th century. 　It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (which was formed from territories of the former Austria-Hungary) with the Kingdom of Serbia, and constituted the first union of the South Slavic people as a sovereign state, following centuries in which the region had been part of the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. 　Peter I of Serbia was its first sovereign. 　The kingdom gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris. 　The official name of the state was changed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929. 　The Kingdom was invaded by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941. 　In 1943, a Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed by the Partisan resistance. 　In 1944, King Peter II, then living in exile, recognised it as the legitimate government. 　The monarchy was subsequently abolished in November 1945. 　Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1945, when a communist government was established. 　It acquired the territories of Istria, Rijeka, and Zadar from Italy. 　Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country as president until his death in 1980. 　In 1963, the country was renamed again, as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). 　The six constituent republics that made up the SFRY were the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Serbia, and SR Slovenia. 　SR Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation. 　After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism, Yugoslavia broke up along its republics' borders, at first into five countries, leading to the Yugoslav Wars. 　From 1993 to 2017, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia tried political and military leaders from the former Yugoslavia for war crimes, genocide, and other crimes committed during those wars. 　After the breakup, the republics of Montenegro and Serbia formed a reduced federative state, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), known from 2003 to 2006 as Serbia and Montenegro. 　This state aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY, but those claims were opposed by the other former republics. 　Eventually, it accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession and in 2003 its official name was changed to Serbia and Montenegro. 　This state dissolved when Montenegro and Serbia each became independent states in 2006, with Kosovo having an ongoing dispute over its declaration of independence in 2008.

<font size=3>
Adrian is a form of the Latin given name Adrianus or Hadrianus. 　Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word adur, meaning "sea" or "water". 　The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. 　Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 – c.476 　BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. 　Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. 　Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. 　As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, although it did not become common until modern times.

<font size=3>
In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws ("pitches") the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. 　In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. 　The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. 　There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer. 　Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. 　Starting in 1973 with the American League (and later the National League) and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. 　The Japanese Central League has not adopted the designated hitter position.

A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide. 　They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops. 　The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg. 　Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (Quercus robur), white oak (Quercus petraea), American white oak (Quercus alba), more exotic is Mizunara Oak all typically have standard sizes: Recently Oregon Oak (Quercus Garryana) has been used. 　"Bordeaux type" 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal), "Burgundy type" 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and "Cognac type" 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal). 　Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE. 　Someone who makes barrels is called a "barrel maker" or cooper (coopers also make buckets, vats, tubs, butter churns, hogsheads, firkins, kegs, kilderkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, pins, troughs and breakers). 　Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol. 　They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, beer, arrack, and sake. 　Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails and tallow. 　Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space. 　The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium. 　The barrel has also been used as a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. 　For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal). 　Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal). 　A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. 　The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.

<font size=3>
Used in mechanical watches and clocks, a barrel is a cylindrical metal box closed by a cover, with a ring of gear teeth around it, containing a spiral spring called the mainspring, which provides power to run the timepiece. 　The barrel turns on an arbor (axle). 　The spring is hooked to the barrel at its outer end and to the arbor at its inner end. 　The barrel teeth engage the first pinion of the wheel train of the watch, usually the center wheel. 　Barrels rotate slowly: for a watch mainspring barrel, the rate is usually one rotation every 8 hours. 　This construction allows the mainspring to be wound (by turning the arbour) without interrupting the tension of the spring driving the timepiece.

<font size=3>
A nest is a structure built for certain animals to hold eggs or young. 　Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates construct nests. 　They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. 　Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used. 　Nests can be found in all types of habitat. 　Nest building is driven by a biological urge known as the nesting instinct in birds and mammals. 　Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest. 　Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults. 　Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate communal nests hosting hundreds of individuals. 　Nests of prairie dogs and several social insects can host millions of individuals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination>Imagination</a> 

<font size=3>
Imagination is the production or simulation of novel objects, sensations, and ideas in the mind without any immediate input of the senses. 　Stefan Szczelkun characterises it as the forming of experiences in one's mind, which can be re-creations of past experiences, such as vivid memories with imagined changes, or completely invented and possibly fantastic scenes. 　Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. 　As an approach to build theory, it is called "disciplined imagination". 　A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds". 　One view of imagination links it with cognition, seeing imagination as a cognitive process used in mental functioning. 　It is increasingly used - in the form of visual imagery - by clinicians in psychological treatment. 　Imaginative thought may - speculatively - become associated with rational thought on the assumption that both activities may involve cognitive processes that may "underpin thinking about possibilities". 　The cognate term, "mental imagery" may be used in psychology for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception. 　Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "imaging" or "imagery" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. 　Constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary imagination driven by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and involuntary imagination (LPFC-independent), such as REM-sleep dreaming, daydreaming, hallucinations, and spontaneous insight. 　The voluntary types of imagination include integration of modifiers, and mental rotation. 　Imagined images, both novel and recalled, are seen with the "mind's eye". 　Imagination, however, is not considered to be exclusively a cognitive activity because it is also linked to the body and place, particularly that it also involves setting up relationships with materials and people, precluding the sense that imagination is locked away in the head. 　Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or fantasies. 　Children often use such narratives and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations. 　When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use role playing to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.

<font size=3>
Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. 　Depending upon the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a long, low rumble to a sudden, loud crack. 　The sudden increase in temperature and hence pressure caused by the lightning produces rapid expansion of the air in the path of a lightning bolt. 　In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, often referred to as a "thunderclap" or "peal of thunder". 　The scientific study of thunder is known as brontology and the irrational fear (phobia) of thunder is called brontophobia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese>Cheese</a> 

<font size=3>
Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. 　It comprises proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep). 　During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. 　The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. 　Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. 　Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are produced in various countries. 　Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged. 　Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. 　The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. 　Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives, or cranberries. 　A cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening cheeses. 　For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. 　Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. 　Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. 　Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. 　Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. 　Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. 　Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. 　The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. 　Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century. 　Plant-based cheese has a lower carbon footprint.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield>Sheffield</a> 

<font size=3>
Sheffield is a city in South Yorkshire, England, whose name derives from the River Sheaf which runs through it. 　The city serves as the administrative centre of the City of Sheffield. 　It is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and some of its southern suburbs were transferred from Derbyshire to the city council. 　It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire. 　The city is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines and the valleys of the River Don with its four tributaries: the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin and the Sheaf. 　Sixty-one per cent of Sheffield's entire area is green space and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park. 　There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, which is estimated to contain around 4.5 million trees. 　The city is 29 miles (47 km) south of Leeds, 32 miles (51 km) east of Manchester, and 33 miles (53 km) north of Nottingham. 　Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, with many significant inventions and technologies having developed in the city. 　In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when stainless steel and crucible steel were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. 　Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. 　International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. 　The Yorkshire ridings became counties in their own right in 1889, the West Riding of Yorkshire county was disbanded in 1974. 　The city then became part of the county of South Yorkshire; this has been made up of separately-governed unitary authorities since 1986. 　The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield, consistent with other British cities. 　Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £11.3 billion in 2015. 　The economy has experienced steady growth, averaging around 5% annually, which is greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber. 　Sheffield had a population of 556,500 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest city in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. 　The Sheffield Built-up Area, of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of Rotherham. 　The district borough, governed from the city, had a population of 556,521 at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the 4th most populous district in England. 　It is one of eleven British cities that make up the Core Cities Group. 　In 2011, the unparished area had a population of 490,070. 　The city has a long sporting heritage and is home both to the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C., and the world's oldest football ground, Sandygate. 　Matches between the two professional clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, are known as the Steel City derby. 　The city is also home to the World Snooker Championship and the Sheffield Steelers, the UK's first professional ice hockey team.

<font size=3>
An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopædia (British English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline. 　Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable. 　Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. 　Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms. 　Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that time as regards language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet). 　As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions. 　The appearance of digital and open-source versions in the 21st century, such as Wikipedia, has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger>Hunger</a> 

<font size=3>
In politics, humanitarian aid, and the social sciences, hunger is defined as a condition in which a person does not have the physical or financial capability to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs for a sustained period. 　In the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience, also known as an appetite. 　The most extreme form of hunger, when malnutrition is widespread, and when people have started dying of starvation through lack of access to sufficient, nutritious food, leads to a declaration of famine. 　Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. 　In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. 　In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. 　While progress was uneven, by 2014, the threat of extreme hunger had receded for a large portion of the world's population. 　According to the FAO's 2021 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger began to rise gradually between 2014 and 2019. 　In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a massive increase, resulting in nearly 770 million people suffering from malnutrition. 　While most of the world's people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America. 　The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. 　The 2018 edition focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rising rates to be especially severe in countries where agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme weather variations. 　The 2019 SOFI report found a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown. 　The 2020 edition instead looked at the prospects of achieving the hunger related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). 　It warned that if nothing was done to counter the adverse trends of the past six years, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger could rise by over 150 million by 2030. 　The 2021 report reported a sharp jump in hunger caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 　Many thousands of organizations are engaged in the field of hunger relief, operating at local, national, regional, or international levels. 　Some of these organizations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in several different fields. 　The organizations range from multilateral institutions to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens. 　Many participate in umbrella networks that connect thousands of different hunger relief organizations. 　At the global level, much of the world's hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN and geared towards achieving SDG 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030.

<font size=3>
Hunger is a sensation that motivates the consumption of food. 　The sensation of hunger typically manifests after only a few hours without eating and is generally considered to be unpleasant. 　Satiety occurs between 5 and 20 minutes after eating. 　There are several theories about how the feeling of hunger arises. 　The desire to eat food, or appetite, is another sensation experienced with regards to eating. 　The term hunger is also the most commonly used in social science and policy discussions to describe the condition of people who suffer from a chronic lack of sufficient food and constantly or frequently experience the sensation of hunger, and can lead to malnutrition. 　A healthy, well-nourished individual can survive for weeks without food intake (see fasting), with claims ranging from three to ten weeks. 　Satiety is the opposite of hunger; it is the sensation of feeling full.

Different types of pins A pin is a device used for fastening objects or fabrics together and can have three sorts of body: a shaft of a rigid inflexible material meant to be inserted in a slot, groove, or hole (as with pivots, hinges, and jigs); a shaft connected to a head and ending in a sharp tip meant to pierce one or more pieces of soft materials like cloth or paper (the straight or push pin); a single strip of a rigid but flexible material (e.g. a wire) whose length has been folded into parallel prongs in such fashion that the middle length of each curves towards the other so that, when anything is inserted between them, they act as a clamp (e.g. the bobby pin), or two strips of a rigid material bound together by a spring at one end so that, when the spring held open, one can insert some material between the prongs at the other end that, the spring allowed to close, then clamp the inserted material. 　According to their function, pins can be made of metals (e.g. steel, copper, or brass), wood, or plastic.

<font size=3>
Decomposition or rot is the process by which dead organic substances are broken down into simpler organic or inorganic matter such as carbon dioxide, water, simple sugars and mineral salts. 　The process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere. 　Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. 　Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. 　Organisms that do this are known as decomposers or detritivores. 　Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. 　The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the Greek word taphos, meaning tomb. 　Decomposition can also be a gradual process for organisms that have extended periods of dormancy. 　One can differentiate abiotic decomposition from biotic decomposition (biodegradation). 　The former means "the degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes", e.g., hydrolysis; the latter means "the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms", typically by microorganisms.

<font size=3>
A melody (from Greek μελῳδία, melōidía, "singing, chanting"), also tune, voice or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. 　In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include other musical elements such as tonal color. 　It is the foreground to the background accompaniment. 　A line or part need not be a foreground melody. 　Melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. 　Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology>Topology</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, topology (from the Greek words τόπος, 'place, location' and λόγος, 'study') concerns with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself. 　A topological space is a set endowed with a structure, called a topology, which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. 　Euclidean spaces, and, more generally, metric spaces are examples of a topological space, as any distance or metric defines a topology. 　The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. 　A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property. 　Basic examples of topological properties are: the dimension, which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface; compactness, which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle; connectedness, which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles. 　The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs. 　Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field's first theorems. 　The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay>Essay</a> 

<font size=3>
An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument, but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. 　Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc. 　Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. 　Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). 　While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples. 　In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. 　Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams. 　The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. 　A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. 　A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions.

Manila (/məˈnɪlə/ mə-NIL-ə, Spanish: [maˈnila]; Filipino: Maynila, pronounced [majˈnilaʔ]), officially City of Manila (Filipino: Lungsod ng Maynila, [luŋˈsod nɐŋ majˈnilaʔ]), is the capital of the Philippines and its second-most populous city. 　Manila is located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay on the island of Luzon. 　It is highly urbanized and as of 2019, was the world's most densely populated city proper. 　Manila is considered to be a global city and is rated as an Alpha – City by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC). 　It was the first chartered city in the country, and was designated as such by the Philippine Commission Act 183 of July 31, 1901. 　It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No. 409, "The Revised Charter of the City of Manila", on June 18, 1949. 　Manila is considered to be part of the world's original set of global cities because its commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific Ocean and connect Asia with the Spanish Americas through the galleon trade; when this was accomplished, it was the first time an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circling the planet had been established. 　Manila is among the most-populous and fastest-growing cities in Southeast Asia. 　By 1258, a Tagalog-fortified polity called Maynila existed on the site of modern Manila. 　On June 24, 1571, after the defeat of the polity's last indigenous Rajah Sulayman III in the Battle of Bangkusay, Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi began constructing the walled fortification Intramuros on the ruins of an older settlement from whose name the Spanish-and-English name Manila derives. 　Manila was used as the capital of the captaincy general of the Spanish East Indies, which included the Marianas, Guam and other islands, and was controlled and administered for the Spanish crown by Mexico City in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. 　Today, Manila has many historic sites. 　In modern times, the name "Manila" is commonly used to refer to the whole metropolitan area, the greater metropolitan area, and the city proper. 　Metro Manila, the officially defined metropolitan area, is the capital region of the Philippines, and includes the much-larger Quezon City and Makati Central Business District. 　It is the most-populous region in the country, one of the most-populous urban areas in the world, and one of the wealthiest regions in Southeast Asia. 　The city proper was home to 1,846,513 people in 2020,  and is the historic core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its administrative limits. 　With 71,263 people per square kilometer, Manila is the most densely populated city proper in the world.  　The Pasig River flows through the middle of the city, dividing it into north and south sections. 　The city comprises 16 administrative districts and is divided into six political districts for the purposes of representation in the Congress of the Philippines and the election of city council members. 　In 2018, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network listed Manila as an "Alpha-" global city, and ranked it seventh in economic performance globally and second regionally, while the Global Financial Centres Index ranks Manila 79th in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage>Cottage</a> 

<font size=3>
A cottage, during England's feudal period, was the holding by a cottager (known as a cotter or bordar) of a small house with enough garden to feed a family and in return for the cottage, the cottager had to provide some form of service to the manorial lord. 　However, in time cottage just became the general term for a small house. 　In modern usage, a cottage is usually a modest, often cosy dwelling, typically in a rural or semi-rural location and not necessarily in England. 　The cottage orné, often quite large and grand residences built by the nobility, dates back to a movement of "rustic" stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th century during the Romantic movement. 　In British English the term now denotes a small dwelling of traditional build, although it can also be applied to modern construction designed to resemble traditional houses ("mock cottages"). 　Cottages may be detached houses, or terraced, such as those built to house workers in mining villages. 　The tied accommodation provided to farm workers was usually a cottage, see cottage garden. 　In England the term holiday cottage now denotes a specialised form of residential let property, attracting various tax benefits to the owner. 　The holiday cottage exists in many cultures under different names. 　In American English, "cottage" is one term for such holiday homes, although they may also be called a "cabin", "chalet", or even "camp". 　In Australia, the term "cabin" is common, cottage usually referring to a smaller pre-modern period dwelling. 　In certain countries (e.g. Nordics, Baltics, and Russia) the term "cottage" has local synonyms: In Finnish mökki, in Estonian suvila, in Latvian vasarnīca, in Livonian sõvvõkuodā, in Swedish stuga, in Norwegian hytte (from the German word Hütte), in Czech or Slovak chata or chalupa, in Russian дача (dacha, which can refer to a vacation/summer home, often located near a body of water). 　In places such as Canada, "cottage" carries no connotations of size (compare with vicarage or hermitage).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin>Violin</a> 

<font size=3>
The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. 　Most violins have a hollow wooden body. 　It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. 　The violin typically has four strings (some can have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. 　It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno). 　Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. 　They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. 　Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. 　Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. 　The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. 　The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it. 　The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. 　In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola. 　Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. 　According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. 　Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. 　Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. 　The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. 　Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. 　A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. 　One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker.

Sparse is a computer software tool designed to find possible coding faults in the Linux kernel. 　Unlike other such tools, this static analysis tool was initially designed to only flag constructs that were likely to be of interest to kernel developers, such as the mixing of pointers to user and kernel address spaces. 　Sparse checks for known problems and allows the developer to include annotations in the code that convey information about data types, such as the address space that pointers point to and the locks that a function acquires or releases. 　Linus Torvalds started writing Sparse in 2003. 　Josh Triplett was its maintainer from 2006, a role taken over by Christopher Li in 2009 and by Luc Van Oostenryck in November 2018. 　Sparse is released under the MIT License.

<font size=3>
Flooding, sometimes referred to as in vivo exposure therapy, is a form of behavior therapy and desensitization—or exposure therapy—based on the principles of respondent conditioning. 　As a psychotherapeutic technique, it is used to treat phobia and anxiety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. 　It works by exposing the patient to their painful memories, with the goal of reintegrating their repressed emotions with their current awareness. 　Flooding was invented by psychologist Thomas Stampfl in 1967. 　It is still used in behavior therapy today. 　Flooding is a psychotherapeutic method for overcoming phobias. 　In order to demonstrate the irrationality of the fear, a psychologist would put a person in a situation where they would face their phobia. 　Under controlled conditions and using psychologically-proven relaxation techniques, the subject attempts to replace their fear with relaxation. 　The experience can often be traumatic for a person, but may be necessary if the phobia is causing them significant life disturbances. 　The advantage to flooding is that it is quick and usually effective. 　There is, however, a possibility that a fear may spontaneously recur. 　This can be made less likely with systematic desensitization, another form of a classical condition procedure for the elimination of phobias.

<font size=3>
Jumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non-living (e.g., robotic) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. 　Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne, by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. 　Some animals, such as the kangaroo, employ jumping (commonly called hopping in this instance) as their primary form of locomotion, while others, such as frogs, use it only as a means to escape predators. 　Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump and show jumping.

Mercury (/ˈmɜːrkjʊri/; Latin: Mercurius [mɛrˈkʊrijʊs] (listen)) is a major god in Roman religion and mythology, being one of the 12 Dii Consentes within the ancient Roman pantheon. 　He is the god of financial gain, commerce, eloquence, messages, communication (including divination), travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery, and thieves; he also serves as the guide of souls to the underworld. 　In Roman mythology, he was considered to be either the son of Maia, one of the seven daughters of the Titan Atlas, and Jupiter, or of Caelus and Dies. 　In his earliest forms, he appears to have been related to the Etruscan deity Turms; both gods share characteristics with the Greek god Hermes. 　He is often depicted holding the caduceus in his left hand. 　Similar to his Greek equivalent Hermes, he was awarded a magic wand by Apollo, which later turned into the caduceus, the staff with intertwined snakes.

Currency A coin is a small object, usually round and flat, used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. 　They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. 　They are most often issued by a government. 　Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them. 　Obverse and its opposite, reverse, refer to the two flat faces of coins and medals. 　In this usage, obverse means the front face of the object and reverse means the back face. 　The obverse of a coin is commonly called heads, because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse is known as tails. 　Coins are generally made of metal or an alloy, or sometimes of man-made materials. 　They are usually disc shaped. 　Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. 　Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. 　Usually, the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. 　In the last hundred years, the face value of circulated coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, primarily due to inflation. 　If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law). 　Exceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value also occur for some bullion coins made of copper, silver, or gold (and rarely other metals, such as platinum or palladium), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. 　Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the British sovereign minted by the United Kingdom, the American Gold Eagle minted by the United States, the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf minted by Canada, and the Krugerrand, minted by South Africa. 　While the Eagle, and Sovereign coins have nominal (purely symbolic) face values, the Krugerrand does not. 　Historically, a considerable variety of coinage metals (including alloys) and other materials (e.g. porcelain) have been used to produce coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment: bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever>Fever</a> 

<font size=3>
Fever, also referred to as pyrexia, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point. 　There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.2 and 38.3 °C (99.0 and 100.9 °F) in humans. 　The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. 　This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. 　When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. 　Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure, with this being more common in young children. 　Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (106 to 108 °F). 　A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening. 　This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections—such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa, COVID-19, and malaria. 　Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer. 　It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss. 　Treatment to reduce fever is generally not required. 　Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. 　Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. 　Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. 　Hyperthermia requires treatment. 　Fever is one of the most common medical signs. 　It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. 　While fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes. 　Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia.

<font size=3>
In structural geology, a fold is a stack of originally planar surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, that are bent or curved during permanent deformation. 　Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. 　They occur as single isolated folds or in periodic sets (known as fold trains). 　Synsedimentary folds are those formed during sedimentary deposition. 　Folds form under varied conditions of stress, pore pressure, and temperature gradient, as evidenced by their presence in soft sediments, the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks, and even as primary flow structures in some igneous rocks. 　A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt, a common feature of orogenic zones. 　Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a result of displacement on a non-planar fault (fault bend fold), at the tip of a propagating fault (fault propagation fold), by differential compaction or due to the effects of a high-level igneous intrusion e.g. above a laccolith.

<font size=3>
Relaxation in psychology is the emotional state of low tension, in which there is an absence of arousal, particularly from negative sources such as anger, anxiety, or fear. 　According to Oxford Dictionaries relaxation is when the body and mind are free from tension and anxiety. 　Relaxation is a form of mild ecstasy coming from the frontal lobe of the brain in which the backward cortex sends signals to the frontal cortex via a mild sedative.　[citation needed] Relaxation can be achieved through meditation, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation. 　Relaxation helps improve coping with stress. 　Stress is the leading cause of mental problems and physical problems, therefore feeling relaxed is beneficial for a person's health. 　When we are stressed, the sympathetic nervous system is activated because we are in a fight-or-flight response mode; over time, this could have negative effects on a human body.

A shrine (Latin: scrinium "case or chest for books or papers"; Old French: escrin "box or case") is a sacred or holy space dedicated to a specific deity, ancestor, hero, martyr, saint, daemon, or similar figure of respect, wherein they are venerated or worshipped. 　Shrines often contain idols, relics, or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated. 　A shrine at which votive offerings are made is called an altar. 　Shrines are found in many of the world's religions, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese folk religion, Shinto, indigenous Philippine folk religions, and Asatru as well as in secular and non-religious settings such as a war memorial. 　Shrines can be found in various settings, such as churches, temples, cemeteries, museums, or in the home. 　However, portable shrines are also found in some cultures.

<font size=3>
A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. 　Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics. 　Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats. 　Other animals commonly kept include rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails, and saltwater snails; amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. 　Small pets may be grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals. 　Pets provide their owners (or "guardians") both physical and emotional benefits. 　Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. 　Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. 　There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. 　Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, or emotional goals with patients. 　People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property or because of the perceived beauty or attractiveness of the animals. 　A 1994 Canadian study found that the most common reasons for not owning a pet were lack of ability to care for the pet when traveling (34.6%), lack of time (28.6%), and lack of suitable housing (28.3%), with dislike of pets being less common (19.6%). 　Some scholars, ethicists, and animal rights organizations have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and the objectification of non-human animals.

<font size=3>
A photograph (also known as a photo, image, or picture) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. 　Most photographs are now created using a smartphone/camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. 　The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect>Dialect</a> 

<font size=3>
The term dialect (from Latin dialectus, dialectos, from the Ancient Greek word διάλεκτος, diálektos 'discourse', from διά, diá 'through' and λέγω, légō 'I speak') can refer to either of two distinctly different types of linguistic phenomena: One usage refers to a variety of a language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers. 　Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely mutually intelligible, especially if close to one another on the dialect continuum. 　The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class or ethnicity. 　A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed an ethnolect, and a geographical/regional dialect may be termed a regiolect (alternative terms include 'regionalect', 'geolect', and 'topolect'). 　According to this definition, any variety of a given language can be classified as a "dialect", including any standardized varieties. 　In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "nonstandard" (vernacular) dialects of the same language is often arbitrary and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations or prevalence and prominence. 　In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary or sociopolitical motives. 　The term "dialect" is however sometimes restricted to mean "non-standard variety", particularly in non-specialist settings and non-English linguistic traditions. 　The other usage of the term "dialect", specific to colloquial settings in a few countries like Italy (see dialetto), France (see patois), much of East Central Europe, and the Philippines, carries a pejorative undertone and underlines the politically and socially subordinated status of a non-national language to the country's single official language. 　In this case, these "dialects" are not actual dialects in the same sense as in the first usage, as they do not derive from the politically dominant language and are therefore not one of its varieties, but they evolved in a separate and parallel way and may thus better fit various parties' criteria for a separate language. 　These "dialects" may be historically cognate with and share genetic roots in the same subfamily as the dominant national language and may even, to a varying degree, share some mutual intelligibility with the latter. 　However, in this sense, unlike in the first usage, these "dialects" may be better defined as separate languages from the standard or national language and the standard or national language would not itself be considered a "dialect", as it is the dominant language in a particular state, be it in terms of linguistic prestige, social or political (e.g. official) status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. 　The term "dialect" used this way implies a political connotation, being mostly used to refer to low-prestige languages (regardless of their actual degree of distance from the national language), languages lacking institutional support, or those perceived as "unsuitable for writing". 　The designation "dialect" is also used popularly to refer to the unwritten or non-codified languages of developing countries or isolated areas, where the term "vernacular language" would be preferred by linguists. 　Features that distinguish dialects from each other can be found in lexicon (vocabulary) and grammar, as well as in pronunciation (phonology, including prosody). 　Where the salient distinctions are only or mostly to be observed in pronunciation, the more specific term accent may be used instead of dialect. 　Differences that are largely concentrated in lexicon may be creoles in their own right. 　When lexical differences are mostly concentrated in the specialized vocabulary of a profession or other organization, they are jargons; differences in vocabulary that are deliberately cultivated to exclude outsiders or to serve as shibboleths are known as cryptolects (or "cant") and include slangs and argots. 　The particular speech patterns used by an individual are referred to as that person's idiolect. 　To classify subsets of language as dialects, linguists take into account linguistic distance. 　The dialects of a language with a writing system will operate at different degrees of distance from the standardized written form. 　Some dialects of a language are not mutually intelligible in spoken form, leading to debate as to whether they are regiolects or separate languages.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont>Vermont</a> 

<font size=3>
Vermont (/vərˈmɒnt/ (listen)) is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　Vermont is bordered by the states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, and New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. 　Admitted to the union in 1791 as the 14th state, it is the only state in New England not bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. 　According to the 2020 U.S. census, the state has a population of 643,503, ranking it the second least-populated in the U.S. after Wyoming. 　It is also the nation's sixth-smallest state in area. 　The state's capital Montpelier is the least-populous state capital in the U.S., while its most-populous city, Burlington, is the least-populous to be a state's largest. 　For some 12,000 years, indigenous peoples have inhabited this area. 　The competitive tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active in the area at the time of European encounter. 　During the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France's colony of New France. 　After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. 　After being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain. 　Thereafter, the nearby British Thirteen Colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed the extent of the area called the New Hampshire Grants to the west of the Connecticut River, encompassing present-day Vermont. 　The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. 　The Green Mountain Boys militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York. 　Ultimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the Vermont Republic in 1777 as an independent state during the American Revolutionary War. 　The Vermont Republic abolished slavery before any of the other states. 　During the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of abolitionist sentiment, although it was also tied to King Cotton through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. 　It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the American Civil War. 　The geography of the state is marked by the Green Mountains, which run north–south up the middle of the state, separating Lake Champlain and other valley terrain on the west from the Connecticut River valley that defines much of its eastern border. 　A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. 　The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. 　Vermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked last on the list of U.S. states and territories by GDP but 34th in GDP per capita. 　In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples. 　As of 2014[update], the state ranked 14th on the American Human Development Index.

<font size=3>
Spectroscopy is the field of study that measures and interprets the electromagnetic spectra that result from the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation. 　Matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of radiative energy, and recently gravitational waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　Historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of the wavelength dependence of the absorption by gas phase matter of visible light dispersed by a prism. 　Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental exploratory tool in the fields of astronomy, chemistry, materials science, and physics, allowing the composition, physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be investigated at the atomic, molecular and macro scale, and over astronomical distances. 　Important applications include biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging.

<font size=3>
Ammunition is the material fired, scattered, dropped, or detonated from any weapon or weapon system. 　Ammunition is both expendable weapons (e.g., bombs, missiles, grenades, land mines) and the component parts of other weapons that create the effect on a target (e.g., bullets and warheads). 　The purpose of ammunition is to project a force against a selected target to have an effect (usually, but not always, lethal). 　An example of ammunition is the firearm cartridge, which includes all components required to deliver the weapon effect in a single package. 　Until the 20th century, black powder was the most common propellant used but has now been replaced in nearly all cases by modern compounds. 　Ammunition comes in a great range of sizes and types and is often designed to work only in specific weapons systems. 　However, there are internationally recognized standards for certain ammunition types (e.g., 5.56×45mm NATO) that enable their use across different weapons and by different users. 　There are also specific types of ammunition that are designed to have a specialized effect on a target, such as armor-piercing shells and tracer ammunition, used only in certain circumstances. 　Ammunition is commonly labeled or colored in a specific manner to assist in its identification and to prevent the wrong ammunition types from being used accidentally or inappropriately.

<font size=3>
A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system. 　Axons transmit electrical impulses. 　Nerves have historically been considered the basic units of the peripheral nervous system. 　A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. 　Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin. 　Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. 　The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium. 　Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium. 　Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves. 　In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.

<font size=3>
A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op, or coop) is "an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise". 　Cooperatives are democratically controlled by their members, with each member having one vote in electing the board of directors.　[citation needed] Cooperatives may include: businesses owned and managed by the people who consume their goods and/or services (a consumer cooperative) businesses where producers pool their output for their common benefit (a producer cooperative) organizations managed by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) businesses where members pool their purchasing power (a purchasing cooperative) multi-stakeholder or hybrid cooperatives that share ownership between different stakeholder groups. 　For example, care cooperatives where ownership is shared between both care-givers and receivers. 　Stakeholders might also include non-profits or investors. 　second- and third-tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives platform cooperatives that use a cooperatively owned and governed website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. 　Research published by the Worldwatch Institute found that in 2012 approximately one billion people in 96 countries had become members of at least one cooperative. 　The turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion. 　Cooperative businesses are typically more productive and economically resilient than many other forms of enterprise, with twice the number of co-operatives (80%) surviving their first five years compared with other business ownership models (41%) according to data from United Kingdom. 　The largest worker owned cooperative in the world, the Mondragon Corporation (founded by Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta), has been in continuous operation since 1956. 　Cooperatives frequently have social goals, which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. 　As an example of this, in 2013, retail co-operatives in the UK invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade as compared with 2.4% for other rival supermarkets. 　Since 2002, cooperatives have been distinguishable on the Internet through the use of a .　coop domain. 　In 2014, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) introduced the Cooperative Marque, meaning ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions can also be identified through a coop ethical consumerism label.

<font size=3>
Ico (イコ, Iko, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions. 　It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept. 　Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. 　The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion. 　The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. 　Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. 　During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. 　The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. 　Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadowy creatures that attempt to draw her back. 　Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles. 　Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, bloom lighting, and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. 　Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. 　Considered a cult classic, it has been called one of the greatest video games of all time, and is often brought up in discussions about video games as an art form. 　It has influenced numerous video games since its release. 　It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. 　A high-definition remaster of the game was released alongside Shadow of the Colossus for the PlayStation 3 in The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection in 2011.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda>Amanda</a> 

<font size=3>
Amanda is a Latin feminine gerundive (i.e. verbal adjective) name meaning, literally, “she who must (or is fit to) be loved”. 　Other translations, with similar meaning, could be "deserving to be loved," "worthy of love," or "loved very much by everyone." 　Its diminutive form includes Mandy, Manda and Amy. 　It is common in countries where Germanic and Romance languages are spoken. 　"Amanda" comes from ama- (the stem of the Latin verb amare, "to love") plus the feminine nominative singular gerundive ending (-nda). 　Other names, especially female names, were derived from this verb form, such as “Miranda”. 　The name "Amanda" occasionally appears in Late Antiquity, such as the Amanda who was the 'wife of the ex-advocate and ex-provincial governor Aper (q.v.); she cared for his estates and raised their children after he adopted the monastic life: "curat illa saeculi curas, ne tu cures”' [Paul. Nol. Epist. 44.4]. In England the name "Amanda" first appears in 1212 on a birth record from Warwickshire, England, and five centuries later the name was popularized by poets and playwrights. In the United States, "Amanda" slowly became more prominent from the 1930s to the 1960s, ranking among the top 200 baby names. From 1976 to 1995, "Amanda" ranked in the ten most popular female baby names in the United States. The name was most popular from 1978 to 1992, when it ranked in the top four.[citation needed] At its prime, in 1980, it was the second most popular.

<font size=3>
A barn is an agricultural building usually on farms and used for various purposes. 　In North America, a barn refers to structures that house livestock, including cattle and horses, as well as equipment and fodder, and often grain. 　As a result, the term barn is often qualified e.g. tobacco barn, dairy barn, cow house, sheep barn, potato barn. 　In the British Isles, the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for unthreshed cereals and fodder, the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters, whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables. 　In mainland Europe, however, barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings (or housebarns in US literature). 　In addition, barns may be used for equipment storage, as a covered workplace, and for activities such as threshing.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient>Coefficient</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series, or an expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression (including variables such as a, b and c).　[better source needed] When the coefficients are themselves variables, they may also be called parameters. 　For example, the polynomial 2 x 2 − x + 3 {\displaystyle 2x^{2}-x+3} has coefficients 2, −1, and 3, and the powers of the variable x {\displaystyle x} in the polynomial a x 2 + b x + c {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c} have coefficient parameters a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} , and c {\displaystyle c} . 　The constant coefficient (or constant term) is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. 　For example, the constant coefficients of the expressions above are the number 3 and the parameter c, respectively. 　The coefficient attached to the highest degree of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the leading coefficient. 　For example, in the expressions above, the leading coefficients are 2 and a, respectively. 　In the context of differential equations, an equation can often be written as equating to zero a polynomial in the unknown functions and their derivatives. 　In this case, the coefficients of the differential equation are the coefficients of this polynomial, and are generally non-constant functions. 　A coefficient is a constant coefficient when it is a constant function. 　For avoiding confusion, the coefficient that is not attached to unknown functions and their derivative is generally called the constant term rather the constant coefficient. 　In particular, in a linear differential equation with constant coefficient, the constant term is generally not supposed to be a constant function.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon>Epsilon</a> 

<font size=3>
Epsilon (/ˈɛpsɪlɒn/, UK also /ɛpˈsaɪlən/; uppercase Ε, lowercase ε or lunate ϵ; Greek: έψιλον) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel IPA: [e̞] or IPA: [ɛ̝]. 　In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. 　It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . 　Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э. 　The name of the letter was originally εἶ (Ancient Greek: [êː]), but it was later changed to ἒ ψιλόν (e psilon 'simple e') in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph αι, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon. 　The uppercase form of epsilon is identical to Latin E but has its own code point in Unicode: U+0395 Ε GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON. 　The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. 　One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed number "3" and is encoded U+03B5 ε GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON. 　The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing, looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar: it is encoded U+03F5 ϵ GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL. 　While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols: computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. 　In TeX, \epsilon ( ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon \!　} ) denotes the lunate form, while \varepsilon ( ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon \!　} ) denotes the reversed-3 form. 　There is also a 'Latin epsilon', ɛ or "open e", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. 　It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B ɛ LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E and U+0190 Ɛ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OPEN E and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. 　The lunate or uncial epsilon provided inspiration for the euro sign, €. 　The lunate epsilon, ϵ, is not to be confused with the set membership symbol ∈; nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon, Ɛ, be confused with the Greek uppercase Σ (sigma). 　The symbol ∈ {\displaystyle \in } , first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership ("belongs to") evolved from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word est. 　In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol ∈ as "element of", as in "1 is an element of the natural numbers" for 1 ∈ N {\displaystyle 1\in \mathbb {N} } , for example. 　As late as 1960, ε itself was used for set membership, while its negation "does not belong to" (now ∉) was denoted by ε' (epsilon prime). 　Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role. 　In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, ϶, for the phrase "such that", although the abbreviation s.t. is occasionally used in place of ϶ in informal cardinals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane>Membrane</a> 

<font size=3>
A membrane is a selective barrier; it allows some things to pass through but stops others. 　Such things may be molecules, ions, or other small particles. 　Membranes can be generally classified into synthetic membranes and biological membranes. 　Biological membranes include cell membranes (outer coverings of cells or organelles that allow passage of certain constituents); nuclear membranes, which cover a cell nucleus; and tissue membranes, such as mucosae and serosae. 　Synthetic membranes are made by humans for use in laboratories and industry (such as chemical plants). 　This concept of a membrane has been known since the eighteenth century but was used little outside of the laboratory until the end of World War II. 　Drinking water supplies in Europe had been compromised by the war and membrane filters were used to test for water safety. 　However, due to the lack of reliability, slow operation, reduced selectivity and elevated costs, membranes were not widely exploited. 　The first use of membranes on a large scale was with microfiltration and ultrafiltration technologies. 　Since the 1980s, these separation processes, along with electrodialysis, are employed in large plants and, today, several experienced companies serve the market. 　The degree of selectivity of a membrane depends on the membrane pore size. 　Depending on the pore size, they can be classified as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. 　Membranes can also be of various thickness, with homogeneous or heterogeneous structure. 　Membranes can be neutral or charged, and particle transport can be active or passive. 　The latter can be facilitated by pressure, concentration, chemical or electrical gradients of the membrane process.

<font size=3>
A gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. 　Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. 　Gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention. 　Gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak. 　Gesticulation and speech work independently of each other, but join to provide emphasis and meaning. 　Gesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are used by speech and sign language. 　In fact, language is thought by some scholars to have evolved in Homo sapiens from an earlier system consisting of manual gestures. 　The theory that language evolved from manual gestures, termed Gestural Theory, dates back to the work of 18th-century philosopher and priest Abbé de Condillac, and has been revived by contemporary anthropologist Gordon W. Hewes, in 1973, as part of a discussion on the origin of language.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit>Habit</a> 

<font size=3>
A habit (or wont as a humorous and formal term) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. 　The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience." 　Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. 　Habits are sometimes compulsory. 　A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. 　New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. 　Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition. 　When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. 　This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. 　Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency; lack of awareness; unintentionality; and uncontrollability.

<font size=3>
Suggestion is the psychological process by which a person guides their own or another person's desired thoughts, feelings, and behaviors by presenting stimuli that may elicit them as reflexes instead of relying on conscious effort. 　Nineteenth-century writers on psychology such as William James used the words "suggest" and "suggestion" in the context of a particular idea which was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind. 　Early scientific studies of hypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (Hull, 1933). 　The original neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideomotor reflex response that William B. Carpenter declared, in 1852, was the principle through which James Braid's hypnotic phenomena were produced.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy>Fairy</a> 

<font size=3>
A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural. 　Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources. 　Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature. 　The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. 　At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. 　Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". 　It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy. 　A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms. 　Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food. 　Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps. 　Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities. 　In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. 　The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking>Smoking</a> 

<font size=3>
Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke is typically breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. 　Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small rectangle of rolling paper to create a small, round cylinder called a cigarette. 　Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. 　In the case of cigarette smoking, these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. 　In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. 　Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. 　Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. 　Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. 　Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. 　Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. 　Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs. 　Smoking has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. 　Smoking tobacco is among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. 　Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. 　Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015. 　Non-smokers account for 600,000 deaths globally due to second-hand smoke. 　The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, publish advertisements to discourage use, limit advertisements that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke. 　Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. 　Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities; in cleansing rituals; or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. 　After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. 　In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). 　In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown. 　Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. 　In the last decade of the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries.

Unlikely is the second album by Brazilian stoner rock band Far from Alaska, released on 4 August 2017. 　It was recorded in the United States, produced by Sylvia Massy and financed via a crowdfunding campaign. 　It is their last album with bassist Edu Filgueira, who left the band in January 2018. 　The band sees the album as a more unpretentious and free work than its predecessor, modeHuman, and believes it to be more representative of what they really are. 　They wanted to create songs that were easier to sing along in shows and that could be easily played with an acoustic guitar in a circle of friends, for example. 　In studio, the members, encouraged by Masy, experimented with a couple of different things, like playing synths with the cables going through electricity-conducting food. 　Like modeHuman, Unlikely was well received by the critics.

A quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. 　The word serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. 　Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. 　In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. 　The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). 　The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. 　The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.

<font size=3>
Wilderness or wildlands (usually in the plural) are natural environments on Earth that have not been significantly modified by human activity or any nonurbanized land not under extensive agricultural cultivation. 　The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness. 　Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity. 　Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity. 　Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. 　These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas. 　Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation. 　They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resist>Resist</a> 

<font size=3>
A resist, used in many areas of manufacturing and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process. 　Often the resist is then removed. 　For example in the resist dyeing of textiles, wax or a similar substance is added to places where the dye is not wanted. 　The wax will "resist" the dye, and after it is removed there will be a pattern in two colours. 　Batik, shibori and tie-dye are among many styles of resist dyeing. 　Wax or grease can also be used as a resist in pottery, to keep some areas free from a ceramic glaze; the wax burns away when the piece is fired. 　Song dynasty Jizhou ware used paper cut-outs and leaves as resists or stencils under glaze to create patterns. 　Other uses of resists in pottery work with slip or paints, and a whole range of modern materials used as resists. 　A range of similar techniques can be used in watercolour and other forms of painting. 　While these artistic techniques stretch back centuries, a range of new applications of the resist principle have recently developed in microelectronics and nanotechnology. 　An example is resists in semiconductor fabrication, using photoresists (often just referred to as "resists") in photolithography.

<font size=3>
A cure is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured. 　The medical condition could be a disease, mental illness, genetic disorder, or simply a condition a person considers socially undesirable, such as baldness or lack of breast tissue. 　An incurable disease may or may not be a terminal illness; conversely, a curable illness can still result in the patient's death. 　The proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment, called the cure fraction or cure rate, is determined by comparing disease-free survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease. 　Another way of determining the cure fraction and/or "cure time" is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population. 　Inherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease. 　When a person has the common cold, and then recovers from it, the person is said to be cured, even though the person might someday catch another cold. 　Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as diabetes mellitus, so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured. 　Related concepts, whose meaning can differ, include response, remission and recovery.

<font size=3>
A tent (/tɛnt/ (listen)) is a shelter consisting of sheets of fabric or other material draped over, attached to a frame of poles or a supporting rope. 　While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using guy ropes tied to stakes or tent pegs. 　First used as portable homes by nomads, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and as temporary shelters. 　Tents range in size from "bivouac" structures, just big enough for one person to sleep in, up to huge circus tents capable of seating thousands of people. 　Tents for recreational camping fall into two categories. 　Tents intended to be carried by backpackers are the smallest and lightest type. 　Small tents may be sufficiently light that they can be carried for long distances on a touring bicycle, a boat, or when backpacking. 　The second type are larger, heavier tents which are usually carried in a car or other vehicle. 　Depending on tent size and the experience of the person or people involved, such tents can usually be assembled (pitched) in between 5 and 25 minutes; disassembly (striking) takes a similar length of time. 　Some very specialised tents have spring-loaded poles and can be pitched in seconds, but take somewhat longer to strike (take down and pack). 　Over the past decade, tents have also been increasingly linked with homelessness crises in the United States, Canada, and other regions. 　Places of multiple homeless people living in tents closely pitched or plotted near each other are often referred to as tent cities.

In military operations, reconnaissance or scouting is the exploration of an area by military forces to obtain information about enemy forces, the terrain, and civil activities in the area of operations. 　In military jargon, reconnaissance is abbreviated to recce (British, Canadian, Australian English) and to recon (American English), both derived from the root word reconnoitre. 　The types of reconnaissance include patrolling the local area of operations and long-range reconnaissance patrols, which are tasks usually realized by U.S. Army Rangers, cavalry scouts, and military intelligence specialists, using navy ships and submarines, reconnaissance aircraft, satellites to collect raw intelligence; and establishing observation posts. 　Moreover, espionage is different from reconnaissance, because spies work as civilians in enemy territory.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral>Mineral</a> 

<font size=3>
In geology and mineralogy, a mineral or mineral species is, broadly speaking, a solid chemical compound with a fairly well-defined chemical composition and a specific crystal structure that occurs naturally in pure form. 　The geological definition of mineral normally excludes compounds that occur only in living organisms. 　However, some minerals are often biogenic (such as calcite) or are organic compounds in the sense of chemistry (such as mellite). 　Moreover, living organisms often synthesize inorganic minerals (such as hydroxylapatite) that also occur in rocks. 　The concept of mineral is distinct from rock, which is any bulk solid geologic material that is relatively homogeneous at a large enough scale. 　A rock may consist of one type of mineral, or may be an aggregate of two or more different types of minerals, spacially segregated into distinct phases. 　Some natural solid substances without a definite crystalline structure, such as opal or obsidian, are more properly called mineraloids. 　If a chemical compound occurs naturally with different crystal structures, each structure is considered a different mineral species. 　Thus, for example, quartz and stishovite are two different minerals consisting of the same compound, silicon dioxide. 　The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is the generally recognized standard body for the definition and nomenclature of mineral species. 　As of November 2022[update], the IMA recognizes 5,863 official mineral species. 　The chemical composition of a named mineral species may vary somewhat by the inclusion of small amounts of impurities. 　Specific varieties of a species sometimes have conventional or official names of their own. 　For example, amethyst is a purple variety of the mineral species quartz. 　Some mineral species can have variable proportions of two or more chemical elements that occupy equivalent positions in the mineral's structure; for example, the formula of mackinawite is given as (Fe,Ni) 9S 8, meaning Fe xNi 9-xS 8, where x is a variable number between 0 and 9. 　Sometimes a mineral with variable composition is split into separate species, more or less arbitrarily, forming a mineral group; that is the case of the silicates Ca xMg yFe 2-x-ySiO 4, the olivine group. 　Besides the essential chemical composition and crystal structure, the description of a mineral species usually includes its common physical properties such as habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting, specific gravity, magnetism, fluorescence, radioactivity, as well as its taste or smell and its reaction to acid. 　Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. 　Silicate minerals comprise approximately 90% of the Earth's crust. 　Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.

A toy or plaything is an object that is used primarily to provide entertainment. 　Simple examples include toy blocks, board games, and dolls. 　Toys are often designed for use by children, although many are designed specifically for adults and pets. 　Toys can provide utilitarian benefits, including physical exercise, cultural awareness, or academic education. 　Additionally, utilitarian objects, especially those which are no longer needed for their original purpose, can be used as toys. 　Examples include children building a fort with empty cereal boxes and tissue paper spools, or a toddler playing with a broken TV remote control. 　The term "toy" can also be used to refer to utilitarian objects purchased for enjoyment rather than need, or for expensive necessities for which a large fraction of the cost represents its ability to provide enjoyment to the owner, such as luxury cars, high-end motorcycles, gaming computers, and flagship smartphones. 　Playing with toys can be an enjoyable way of training young children for life experiences. 　Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. 　Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment and smart toys. 　Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only. 　The origin of toys is prehistoric; dolls representing infants, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults, are readily found at archaeological sites. 　The origin of the word "toy" is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. 　Toys are mainly made for children. 　The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old. 　Playing with toys is an important part of aging. 　Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help with cognition, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, become stronger physically, and practice skills needed in adulthood. 　Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.

<font size=3>
Perturbation (from Latin: perturbare "to confuse, disorder, disturb", from per- "through" + turbare "disturb, confuse," from turba "turmoil, crowd") is a set of pedology (soil study) and sedimentary geology processes relating to changes in the nature of water-borne alluvial sediments and in situ soil deposits over time. 　Pedoturbation (from Greek: πέδον (pédon), "soil") involves mixing between soil horizons, and is an important factor in soil formation. 　Pedoturbation includes churning clays, cryoturbation, and bioturbation. 　Types of bioturbation include faunal pedoturbation (animal burrowing), and floral pedoturbation (root growth, tree-uprootings). 　Pedoturbation transforms soils through destratification, mixing, and sorting, as well as creating preferential flow paths for soil gas and infiltrating water. 　The zone of active bioturbation is termed the soil biomantle. 　Soil perturbation that is not pedoturbation. 　Precipitation of surface salts also causes localized disruption of soils. 　Because it does not result in mixing between soil horizons, it is not considered pedoturbation. 　In geology, bioturbation is the displacement and mixing of sediment particles (i.e. sediment reworking) and solutes (i.e. biologically-mediated irrigation) by benthic zone (bottom water) fauna (animals) or flora (plants). 　Activity of bacteria is yet another important cause of perturbation in the geological record. 　Field termites are especially important in tropical climate regions within 15° of the equator.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass>Brass</a> 

<font size=3>
Brass is an alloy of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), in proportions which can be varied to achieve different colours and mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties, but copper typically has the larger proportion. 　In use since prehistoric times, it is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. 　Brass is similar to bronze, another copper alloy that uses tin instead of zinc. 　Both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic (As), lead (Pb), phosphorus (P), aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), and silicon (Si). 　Historically, the distinction between the two alloys has been less consistent and clear, and increasingly museums use the more general term "copper alloy." 　Brass has long been a popular material for its bright gold-like appearance and is still used for drawer pulls and doorknobs. 　It has also been widely used to make sculpture and utensils because of its low melting point, high workability (both with hand tools and with modern turning and milling machines), durability, and electrical and thermal conductivity. 　Brasses with higher copper content are softer and more golden in colour; conversely those with less copper and thus more zinc are harder are more silver in colour. 　Brass is still commonly used in applications where corrosion resistance and low friction are required, such as locks, hinges, gears, bearings, ammunition casings, zippers, plumbing, hose couplings, valves, and electrical plugs and sockets. 　It is used extensively for musical instruments such as horns and bells. 　The composition of brass, generally 66% copper and 34% zinc, makes it a favorable substitute for copper in costume jewelry and fashion jewelry, as it exhibits greater resistance to corrosion. 　Brass is not as hard as bronze, and so is not suitable for most weapons and tools nor marine uses, because the zinc reacts with minerals in salt water, leaving porous copper behind; Marine bronze, with added tin, avoids this, as does bronze. 　Brass is often used in situations in which it is important that sparks not be struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario>Mario</a> 

<font size=3>
Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. 　He is the title character of the video game franchise of the same name and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. 　Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. 　Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. 　Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. 　Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi. 　Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. 　Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. 　Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. 　Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. 　He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. 　Since 1992, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet. 　After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. 　These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. 　He has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. 　Mario has also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. 　He will be voiced by Chris Pratt in the upcoming 2023 film adaptation. 　Mario is near-unanimously considered to be the most famous character in the video game industry and an established pop culture icon. 　Mario's likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. 　He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media. 　With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail>Sail</a> 

<font size=3>
Sail rigs A sail is a tensile structure—which is made from fabric or other membrane materials—that uses wind power to propel sailing craft, including sailing ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles. 　Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials—including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments—usually in a three- or four-sided shape. 　A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack—its angle with respect to the apparent wind. 　Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. 　Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail. 　On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface—just as an airplane wing generates lift—which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion. 　The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. 　Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind. 　Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. 　They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet. 　In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. 　Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points. 　Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.
