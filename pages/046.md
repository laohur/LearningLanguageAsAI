## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staring>Staring</a> 
<font size=3>
Staring is a prolonged gaze or fixed look. 　In staring, one object or person is the continual focus of visual interest, for an amount of time. 　Staring can be interpreted as being either hostile like disapproval of another's behavior, or the result of intense concentration, interest or affection. 　Staring behavior can be considered as a form of aggression like when it is an invasion of an individual's privacy in certain contexts, or as a nonverbal cue to convey feelings of attraction in a social setting. 　The resultant behavior or action defines whether it is aggressive in nature (e.g. leering that results in street harassment), passive or active expression of attraction, etc. 　However, to some extent staring often occurs accidentally, and often a person would be simply staring into a space for awareness, or could be lost in thought, stupefied, or be unable to see. 　As such, the meaning of a person's staring behavior depends upon the attributions made by the observer. 　In a staring contest, a mutual staring can take the form of a battle of wills. 　When eye contact is reciprocated, it could be an aggressive-dominating game where the loser is the person who looks away first. 　Staring conceptually also implies confronting the inevitable – 'staring death in the face', or 'staring into the abyss'.　[citation needed] Group staring evokes and emphasizes paranoia; such as the archetypal stranger walking into a saloon in a Western to be greeted by the stares of all the regulars. 　The fear of being stared at is called scopophobia.

In law, an appeal is the process in which cases are reviewed by a higher authority, where parties request a formal change to an official decision. 　Appeals function both as a process for error correction as well as a process of clarifying and interpreting law. 　Although appellate courts have existed for thousands of years, common law countries did not incorporate an affirmative right to appeal into their jurisprudence until the 19th century.

<font size=3>
An invasion is a military offensive in which large numbers of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory owned by another such entity, generally with the objective of either: conquering; liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory; forcing the partition of a country; altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government; or a combination thereof. 　An invasion can be the cause of a war, be a part of a larger strategy to end a war, or it can constitute an entire war in itself. 　Due to the large scale of the operations associated with invasions, they are usually strategic in planning and execution.　[not verified in body]

Coordinates: 13°N 122°E﻿ / ﻿13°N 122°E﻿ / 13; 122 The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (listen); Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas), is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. 　It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean and consists of around 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. 　The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest. 　It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. 　The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2021[update], it had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's thirteenth-most-populous country. 　The Philippines has diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. 　Manila is the country's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City; both lie within the urban area of Metro Manila. 　Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. 　Adoption of animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called kedatuan, rajahnates, and sultanates. 　The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. 　In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villaloboscode: spa promoted to code: es named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. 　Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming ruled by the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. 　During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. 　In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. 　Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino revolutionaries declared the First Philippine Republic. 　The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. 　Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. 　Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a decades-long dictatorship by a nonviolent revolution. 　The Philippines is an emerging market and a newly industrialized country whose economy is transitioning from being agriculture centered to services and manufacturing centered. 　It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. 　The location of the Philippines as an island country both on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes it prone to earthquakes and typhoons. 　The country has a variety of natural resources and is home to a globally significant level of biodiversity.

<font size=3>
A desk or bureau is a piece of furniture with a flat table-style work surface used in a school, office, home or the like for academic, professional or domestic activities such as reading, writing, or using equipment such as a computer. 　Desks often have one or more drawers, compartments, or pigeonholes to store items such as office supplies and papers. 　Desks are usually made of wood or metal, although materials such as glass are sometimes seen. 　Some desks have the form of a table, although usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk), unlike most usual tables. 　Some desks do not have the form of a table, for instance, an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person's lap. 　Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. 　In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). 　Some people use standing desks to be able to stand while using them.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream>Stream</a> 
<font size=3>
A stream is a continuous body of surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel. 　Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to by a variety of local or regional names. 　Long large streams are usually called rivers, while smaller, less voluminous and more intermittent streams are known as streamlets, brooks or creeks. 　The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs – surface runoff (from precipitation or meltwater), daylighted subterranean water, and surfaced groundwater (spring water). 　The surface and subterranean water are highly variable between periods of rainfall. 　Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation. 　The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls. 　Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. 　The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. 　Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. 　The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is a core element of environmental geography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform>Reform</a> 
<font size=3>
Reform (Latin: reformo) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. 　The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from Christopher Wyvill's Association movement which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim. 　Reform is generally regarded as antithetical to revolution. 　Developing countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies. 　This can include reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service, and public financial management. 　In the United States, rotation in office or term limits would, by contrast, be more revolutionary,[citation needed] in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.

A poet is a person who studies and creates poetry. 　Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. 　A poet may simply be the creator (thinker, songwriter, writer, or author) who creates (composes) poems (oral or written), or they may also perform their art to an audience. 　The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, expressing ideas either in a literal sense (such as communicating about a specific event or place) or metaphorically. 　Poets have existed since prehistory, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods. 　Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed over time, resulting in countless poets as diverse as the literature that (since the advent of writing systems) they have produced.

<font size=3>
Dust is made of fine particles of solid matter. 　On Earth, it generally consists of particles in the atmosphere that come from various sources such as soil lifted by wind (an aeolian process), volcanic eruptions, and pollution. 　Dust in homes is composed of about 20–50% dead skin cells. 　The rest, and in offices, and other human environments is composed of small amounts of plant pollen, human hairs, animal fur, textile fibers, paper fibers, minerals from outdoor soil, burnt meteorite particles, and many other materials which may be found in the local environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly>Fly</a> 
<font size=3>
Flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek δι- di- "two", and πτερόν pteron "wing". 　Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics. 　Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described. 　Flies have a mobile head, with a pair of large compound eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. 　Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. 　Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are often laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. 　Other species like Metopia argyrocephala are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals. 　The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults. 　Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance. 　Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. 　Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. 　Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases; and houseflies, commensal with humans all over the world, spread food-borne illnesses. 　Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. 　Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. 　Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. 　They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.

A uniform is a variety of costume worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity. 　Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in prisons. 　In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects. 　For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform.

<font size=3>
Shooting is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon (such as a gun, bow, crossbow, slingshot, or blowpipe). 　Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting. 　When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants. 　Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting, or in combat. 　The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter. 　A skilled, accurate shooter is a marksman or sharpshooter, and a person's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their marksmanship.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey>Turkey</a> 
<font size=3>
Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Türkiye (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti] (listen)), is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. 　It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. 　Cyprus is off the south coast. 　Most people are Turks, and Kurds are the largest minority. 　Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre. 　One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Hittites, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks, Persians and others. 　Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions were culturally Hellenised, and this continued during the Byzantine era. 　The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities. 　Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period. 　After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. 　From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power declined with a gradual loss of territories. 　Mahmud II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century. 　The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party period. 　The Three Pashas took control with the 1913 coup d'état, and entered World War I as one of the Central Powers in 1914. 　During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects. 　After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. 　The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923. 　With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic. 　Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies. 　Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952. 　During the Cold War years, the country endured two military coups in 1960 and 1980, and a period of economic and political turmoil in the 1970s. 　The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability. 　Since 2002, the country's political system has been dominated by the AKP and its leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, under whom a decade of rapid growth in nominal GDP took place until 2013, which was followed by a period of recession and stagnation in terms of USD-based nominal GDP between 2013 and 2020, and high inflation as of 2023. 　The AKP government's initial economic achievements, which were financed through privatization revenues and loans, were overshadowed by democratic backsliding and an erosion in the separation of powers and civil liberties, which gained momentum after the parliamentary republic was replaced by an executive presidential system with a referendum in 2017. 　Turkey is a regional power with a geopolitically significant strategic location. 　The economy of Turkey, which is a founding member of the OECD and G20, is classified among the E7, EAGLEs and NICs, and currently ranks twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP and eleventh-largest by PPP. 　Turkey is a charter member of the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank; a founding member of the OSCE, OIC, BSEC, ECO, MIKTA, TURKSOY and OTS; and an early member of NATO. 　After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995, and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. 　Turkey has a rich cultural legacy shaped by centuries of history and the influence of the various peoples that have inhabited its territory over several millennia; it is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is among the most visited countries in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion>Billion</a> 
<font size=3>
Billion is a word for a large number, and it has two distinct definitions: 1,000,000,000, i.e. one thousand million, or 109 (ten to the ninth power), as defined on the short scale. 　This is its only current meaning in English. 　1,000,000,000,000, i.e. one million million, or 1012 (ten to the twelfth power), as defined on the long scale. 　This number, which is one thousand times larger than the short scale billion, is now referred to in English as one trillion. 　However, this number is the historical meaning in English for the word "billion" (with the exception of the United States), a meaning which was still in official use in British English until some time after World War II. 　American English adopted the short scale definition from the French (it enjoyed usage in France at the time, alongside the long-scale definition). 　The United Kingdom used the long scale billion until 1974, when the government officially switched to the short scale, but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism. 　Other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion. 　Milliard, another term for one thousand million, is extremely rare in English, but words similar to it are very common in other European languages. 　For example, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Hebrew (Asia), Hungarian, Italian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish (although the expression mil millones — a thousand million — is far more common), Swedish, Tajik, Turkish, Ukrainian and Uzbek — use milliard, or a related word, for the short scale billion, and billion (or a related word) for the long scale billion. 　Thus for these languages billion is a thousand times larger than the modern English billion.
