<font size=3>
A statue is a free-standing sculpture in which the realistic, full-length figures of persons or animals are carved or cast in a durable material such as wood, metal or stone. 　Typical statues are life-sized or close to life-size; a sculpture that represents persons or animals in full figure but that is small enough to lift and carry is a statuette or figurine, whilst one more than twice life-size is a colossal statue. 　Statues have been produced in many cultures from prehistory to the present; the oldest-known statue dating to about 30,000 years ago. 　Statues represent many different people and animals, real and mythical. 　Many statues are placed in public places as public art. 　The world's tallest statue, Statue of Unity, is 182 metres (597 ft) tall and is located near the Narmada dam in Gujarat, India.

<font size=3>
An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. 　The word is also used informally for people who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities, and fields of endeavor, such as sales. 　An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital or country. 　The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy, whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. 　Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. 　Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador. 　The equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners. 　The ambassadors of the Holy See are known as Papal or Apostolic Nuncios.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry>Cavalry</a> 

<font size=3>
Historically, cavalry (from the French word cavalerie, itself derived from "cheval" meaning "horse") are soldiers or warriors who fight mounted on horseback. 　Cavalry were the most mobile of the combat arms, operating as light cavalry in the roles of reconnaissance, screening, and skirmishing in many armies, or as heavy cavalry for decisive shock attacks in other armies. 　An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations depending on era and tactics, such as cavalryman, horseman, trooper, cataphract, knight, drabant, hussar, uhlan, mamluk, cuirassier, lancer, dragoon, or horse archer. 　The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals for mounts, such as camels or elephants. 　Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the early 17th to the early 18th century as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which in most armies later evolved into standard cavalry while retaining their historic designation. 　Cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a soldier fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot. 　Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent. 　The speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in nomadic societies of Asia, notably the Huns of Attila and the later Mongol armies. 　In Europe, cavalry became increasingly armoured (heavy), and eventually evolving into the mounted knights of the medieval period. 　During the 17th century, cavalry in Europe discarded most of its armor, which was ineffective against the muskets and cannons that were coming into common use, and by the mid-18th century armor had mainly fallen into obsolescence, although some regiments retained a small thickened cuirass that offered protection against lances, sabres, and bayonets; including some protection against a shot from distance. 　In the interwar period, while some cavalry still served during World War II (notably in the Red Army, the Mongolian People's Army, the Royal Italian Army, the Romanian Army, the Polish Land Forces, and light reconnaissance units within the Waffen SS) many cavalry units were converted into motorized infantry and mechanized infantry units, or reformed as tank troops. 　The cavalry tank or cruiser tank was one designed with a speed and purpose beyond that of infantry tanks and would subsequently develop into the main battle tank. 　Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. 　Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (analogous to historical light cavalry) or main battle tank units (analogous to historical heavy cavalry).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf>Golf</a> 

<font size=3>
Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. 　Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. 　Courses typically have either 18 or 9 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. 　Each hole on a course contains a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the cup. 　There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various hazards such as water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers. 　Each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout. 　Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. 　Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, especially at the elite level. 　The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. 　The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. 　Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. 　This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship.

<font size=3>
Alabama (/ˌæləˈbæmə/) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered by Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south; and Mississippi to the west. 　Alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. 　With a total of 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of inland waterways, Alabama has among the most of any state. 　Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. 　Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". 　The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. 　Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville. 　Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana. 　Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan area and its economic center. 　Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. 　The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American Revolutionary War. 　Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. 　In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. 　During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used African American slave labor. 　In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. 　Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state's economy. 　Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against African Americans and also Alabama's French Creole population[citation needed] from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. 　In the early 20th century, despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid-20th century. 　During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. 　High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. 　During and after World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy diversified with new industries. 　NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama's economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an aerospace industry. 　Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology. 　The state's geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. 　Politically, as part of the Deep South, Alabama is predominantly a conservative state, and is known for its Southern culture. 　Within Alabama, American football, particularly at the college level at schools such as the University of Alabama, Auburn University, Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University, Troy University, the University of South Alabama, and Jacksonville State University, plays a major part of the state's culture.

A collective is a group of entities that share or are motivated by at least one common issue or interest, or work together to achieve a common objective.　[citation needed] Collectives can differ from cooperatives in that they are not necessarily focused upon an economic benefit or saving, but can be that as well. 　The term "collective" is sometimes used to describe a species as a whole—for example, the human collective. 　For political purposes, a collective is defined by decentralized, or "majority-rules" decision making styles.

Coordinates: 34°S 64°W﻿ / ﻿34°S 64°W﻿ / -34; -64 Argentina (Spanish pronunciation: [aɾxenˈtina] (listen)), officially the Argentine Republic (Spanish: República Argentina), is a country in the southern half of South America. 　Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi), making it the second-largest country in South America after Brazil, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. 　It shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. 　Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. 　The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. 　Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and a part of Antarctica. 　The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period. 　The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. 　The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century. 　Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. 　The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation. 　The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; over 60% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry, and Argentine culture has significant connections to Italian culture. 　The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh-wealthiest nation in the world by the early 20th century. 　In 1896, Argentina's GDP per capita surpassed that of the United States and was consistently in the top ten before at least 1920. 　Currently, it is ranked 62nd in the world. 　Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into underdevelopment, although it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several decades. 　Following the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his widow and vice president, Isabel Perón, ascended to the presidency, before being overthrown in 1976. 　The following military junta, which was supported by the United States, persecuted and murdered thousands of political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as president in 1983. 　Argentina is a regional power, and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs. 　A major non-NATO ally of the United States, Argentina is a developing country that ranks 47th in the Human Development Index, the second-highest in Latin America after Chile. 　It maintains the second-largest economy in South America, and is a member of G-15 and G20. 　Argentina is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License>License</a> 

<font size=3>
A license (or licence) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit). 　A license is granted by a party (licensor) to another party (licensee) as an element of an agreement between those parties. 　In the case of a license issued by a government, the license is obtained by applying for it. 　In the case of a private party, it is by a specific agreement, usually in writing (such as a lease or other contract). 　The simplest definition is "A license is a promise not to sue," because a license usually either permits the licensed party to engage in an activity which is illegal, and subject to prosecution, without the license (e.g. fishing, driving an automobile, or operating a broadcast radio or television station), or it permits the licensed party to do something that would violate the rights of the licensing party (e.g. make copies of a copyrighted work), which, without the license, the licensed party could be sued, civilly, criminally, or both. 　In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. 　It may require paying a fee or proving a capability (or both). 　The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations. 　A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a patented invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. 　A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor. 　Term: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. 　This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. 　It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement. 　Territory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. 　For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan. 　Again, a shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". 　That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. 　Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so. 　Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. 　Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. 　Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing.

<font size=3>
Parking is the act of stopping and disengaging a vehicle and leaving it unoccupied. 　Parking on one or both sides of a road is often permitted, though sometimes with restrictions. 　Some buildings have parking facilities for use of the buildings' users. 　Countries and local governments have rules for design and use of parking spaces. 　Car parking is essential to car-based travel. 　Cars are typically stationary around 95 per cent of the time. 　The availability and price of car parking supports and subsidize car dependency. 　Car parking uses up a lot of urban land, especially in North America - as much as half in many North American city centers.

Oklahoma (/ˌoʊkləˈhoʊmə/ (listen); Choctaw: Oklahumma [oklahómma]; Cherokee: ᎣᎧᎳᎰᎹ, Okalahoma [ògàlàhǒːmã́]) is a state in the South Central region of the United States, bordered by Texas on the south and west, Kansas on the north, Missouri on the northeast, Arkansas on the east, New Mexico on the west, and Colorado on the northwest. 　Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. 　Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. 　The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla, 'people' and humma, which translates as 'red'. 　Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State", in reference to the settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. 　Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907. 　With ancient mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather. 　Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions. 　Historically it served as a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans removed from east of the Mississippi River, a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a destination for Southern settlers. 　There are currently twenty-five Native American languages still spoken in Oklahoma. 　A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. 　Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.

<font size=3>
A billboard (also called a hoarding in the UK and many other parts of the world) is a large outdoor advertising structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy roads. 　Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers. 　Typically brands use billboards to build their brands or to push for their new products. 　The largest ordinary-sized billboards are located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). 　These afford greatest visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments. 　Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. 　Posters are a smaller format and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian exposure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne>Throne</a> 

<font size=3>
A throne is the seat of state of a potentate or dignitary, especially the seat occupied by a sovereign on state occasions; or the seat occupied by a pope or bishop on ceremonial occasions. 　"Throne" in an abstract sense can also refer to the monarchy or the Crown itself, an instance of metonymy, and is also used in many expressions such as "the power behind the throne". 　Since the early advanced cultures, a throne has been known as a symbol of divine and secular rule and the establishment of a throne as a defining sign of the claim to power and authority. 　It can be with a high backrest and feature heraldic animals or other decorations as adornment and as a sign of power and strength. 　A throne can be placed underneath a canopy or baldachin. 　The throne can stand on steps or a dais and is thus always elevated. 　The expression "ascend (mount) the throne" takes its meaning from the steps leading up to the dais or platform, on which the throne is placed, being formerly comprised in the word's significance. 　Coats of arms or insignia can feature on throne or canopy and represent the dynasty. 　Even in the physical absence of the ruler an empty throne can symbolise the everlasting presence of the monarchical authority. 　When used in a political or governmental sense, a throne typically exists in a civilization, nation, tribe, or other politically designated group that is organized or governed under a monarchical system. 　Throughout much of human history societies have been governed under monarchical systems, in the beginning as autocratic systems and later evolved in most cases as constitutional monarchies within liberal democratic systems, resulting in a wide variety of thrones that have been used by given heads of state. 　These have ranged from stools in places such as in Africa to ornate chairs and bench-like designs in Europe and Asia, respectively. 　Often, but not always, a throne is tied to a philosophical or religious ideology held by the nation or people in question, which serves a dual role in unifying the people under the reigning monarch and connecting the monarch upon the throne to his or her predecessors, who sat upon the throne previously. 　Accordingly, many thrones are typically held to have been constructed or fabricated out of rare or hard to find materials that may be valuable or important to the land in question. 　Depending on the size of the throne in question it may be large and ornately designed as an emplaced instrument of a nation's power, or it may be a symbolic chair with little or no precious materials incorporated into the design. 　When used in a religious sense, throne can refer to one of two distinct uses. 　The first use derives from the practice in churches of having a bishop or higher-ranking religious official (archbishop, pope, etc.) sit on a special chair which in church referred to by written sources as a "throne", or “cathedra” (Latin for 'chair') and is intended to allow such high-ranking religious officials a place to sit in their place of worship. 　The other use for throne refers to a belief among many of the world's monotheistic and polytheistic religions that the deity or deities that they worship are seated on a throne. 　Such beliefs go back to ancient times, and can be seen in surviving artwork and texts which discuss the idea of ancient gods (such as the Twelve Olympians) seated on thrones. 　In the major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Throne of God is attested to in religious scriptures and teachings, although the origin, nature, and idea of the Throne of God in these religions differs according to the given religious ideology practiced. 　In the west, a throne is most identified as the seat upon which a person holding the title King, Queen, Emperor, or Empress sits in a nation using a monarchy political system, although there are a few exceptions, notably with regards to religious officials such as the pope and bishops of various sects of the Christian faith. 　Changing geo-political tides have resulted in the collapse of several dictatorial and autocratic governments, which in turn have left a number of throne chairs empty. 　Many of these thrones—such as China's Dragon Throne—survive today as historic examples of nation's previous government.

<font size=3>
Louisiana (French: La Louisiane [la lwizjan] (listen); Spanish: Luisiana) is a state in the Deep South and South Central regions of the United States. 　It is the 20th-smallest by area and the 25th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. 　Louisiana is bordered by the state of Texas to the west, Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. 　A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River. 　Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are equivalent to counties, making it one of only two U.S. states not subdivided into counties (the other being Alaska and its boroughs). 　The state's capital is Baton Rouge, and its largest city is New Orleans, with a population of roughly 383,000 people. 　Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th century Louisiana French, Dominican Creole, Spanish, French Canadian, Acadian, Native American, and West African cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the U.S. Before the American purchase of the territory in 1803, the present–day U.S. state of Louisiana had been both a French colony and a Spanish one. 　In addition, colonists imported various West African peoples as slaves in the 18th century. 　Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture; Filipinos also arrived during colonial Louisiana. 　In the post–Civil War environment, Anglo Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization, and in 1921, English was for a time made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974. 　There has never been an official language in Louisiana, and the state constitution enumerates "the right of the people to preserve, foster, and promote their respective historic, linguistic, and cultural origins." 　Based on national averages, Louisiana frequently ranks low among the U.S. in terms of health, education, development, and high in measures of poverty. 　In 2018, Louisiana was ranked as the least healthy state in the country, with high levels of drug-related deaths. 　It also has had the highest homicide rate in the United States since at least the 1990s. 　Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. 　These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibises and egrets. 　There are also many species of tree frogs such as the state recognized American green tree frog and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. 　In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. 　These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants. 　Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not received recognition.

<font size=3>
Personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that are formed from biological and environmental factors, and which change over time. 　While there is no generally agreed-upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with the environment one is surrounded by. 　Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as traits that predict an individual's behavior. 　On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. 　Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable. 　The study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior. 　Psychologists have taken many different approaches to the study of personality, including biological, cognitive, learning, and trait-based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches. 　The various approaches used to study personality today reflect the influence of the first theorists in the field, a group that includes Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon Allport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers.

<font size=3>
Jerusalem (/dʒəˈruːsələm/; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם Yerushaláyim; Arabic: القُدس Al‑Quds) is a city in Western Asia. 　Situated on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, it is one of the oldest cities in the world and is considered to be a holy city for the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 　Both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital, as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. 　Because of this dispute, neither claim is widely recognized internationally. 　Throughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. 　The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. 　During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE), Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning "City of Shalem" after a Canaanite deity. 　During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 8th century BCE, the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. 　In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. 　Today those walls define the Old City, which has been traditionally divided into four-quarters – known since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim quarters. 　The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. 　Since 1860, Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. 　In 2022, Jerusalem had a population of some 971,800 residents, of which almost 60% were Jews and almost 40% Palestinians. 　In 2020, the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%). 　According to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. 　Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. 　These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. 　The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. 　The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as their own "Old Testament", was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. 　In Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. 　The city was the first qibla, the standard direction for Muslim prayers (salah), and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he speaks to God, according to the Quran. 　As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 　Today, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. 　During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. 　Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently effectively annexed it into Jerusalem, together with additional surrounding territory. 　One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. 　All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi), and the Supreme Court. 　The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation>Adaptation</a> 

<font size=3>
In biology, adaptation has three related meanings. 　Firstly, it is the dynamic evolutionary process of natural selection that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. 　Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. 　Thirdly, it is a phenotypic trait or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has evolved through natural selection. 　Historically, adaptation has been described from the time of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Empedocles and Aristotle. 　In 18th and 19th century natural theology, adaptation was taken as evidence for the existence of a deity. 　Charles Darwin proposed instead that it was explained by natural selection. 　Adaptation is related to biological fitness, which governs the rate of evolution as measured by change in allele frequencies. 　Often, two or more species co-adapt and co-evolve as they develop adaptations that interlock with those of the other species, such as with flowering plants and pollinating insects. 　In mimicry, species evolve to resemble other species; in Müllerian mimicry this is a mutually beneficial co-evolution as each of a group of strongly defended species (such as wasps able to sting) come to advertise their defenses in the same way. 　Features evolved for one purpose may be co-opted for a different one, as when the insulating feathers of dinosaurs were co-opted for bird flight. 　Adaptation is a major topic in the philosophy of biology, as it concerns function and purpose (teleology). 　Some biologists try to avoid terms which imply purpose in adaptation, not least because it suggests a deity's intentions, but others note that adaptation is necessarily purposeful.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed>Seed</a> 

<font size=3>
In botany, seed is an undeveloped plant embryo and food reserve enclosed in a protective outer covering. 　More generally, the term "seed" means anything that can be sown, which may include seed and husk or tuber. 　Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after the embryo sac is fertilized by sperm from pollen, forming a zygote. 　The embryo within a seed develops from the zygote, forming a seed coat around the ovule, and grows within the mother plant to a certain size before growth is halted. 　The formation of the seed is a part of the process of reproduction in seed plants (spermatophytes). 　Other plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. 　Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates. 　In the flowering plants, the ovary ripens into a fruit which contains the seed and serves to disseminate it. 　Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry fruits. 　Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. 　Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. 　Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.

<font size=3>
Look up arrest in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　An arrest is the act of apprehending and taking a person into custody (legal protection or control), usually because the person has been suspected of or observed committing a crime. 　After being taken into custody, the person can be questioned further and/or charged. 　An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system, sometimes it is also done after a court warrant for the arrest. 　Police and various other officers have powers of arrest. 　In some places, a citizen's arrest is permitted; for example in England and Wales, any person can arrest "anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence", although certain conditions must be met before taking such action. 　Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID. 　As a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of probable cause in the United States. 　Furthermore, in most democracies, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and 24 or 48 hours in the United States and France) before the detained person must be either charged or released.

<font size=3>
A critic is a person who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. 　Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. 　Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. 　They may also include a positive or negative personal response. 　Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. 　Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. 　Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. 　In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components. 　Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. 　Influential critics of art, music, theater and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. 　One very famous example is John Ruskin's Seven Lamps of Architecture and The Stones of Venice. 　Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. 　For instance, they may take a feminist or Freudian perspective. 　Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. 　When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "pundits" instead of critics. 　Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails subjectivity. 　An established critic can play a powerful role as a public arbiter of taste or opinion. 　Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

<font size=3>
A songwriter is a musician who professionally composes musical compositions or writes lyrics for songs, or both. 　The writer of the music for a song can be called a composer, although this term tends to be used mainly in the classical music genre and film scoring. 　A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. 　The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. 　For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. 　Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. 　Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have external publishers. 　The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees, college diplomas and "rock schools". 　Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are significant for modern songwriters. 　Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. 　Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. 　The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. 　This is governed by international copyright law. 　Songwriters can be employed in a variety of different ways. 　They may exclusively write lyrics or compose music alongside another artist, present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. 　Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters. 　Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. 　Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.

<font size=3>
Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/; Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō, [toːkʲoː] (listen)), officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the capital and most populous city of Japan. 　Formerly known as Edo, its metropolitan area (13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles) is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018[update]; the city proper has a population of 13.99 million people. 　Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. 　Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and is the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. 　Originally a fishing village named Edo, the city became politically prominent in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. 　By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world with a population of over one million people. 　Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, which was renamed "Tokyo" (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). 　Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. 　Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion efforts, going on to lead the Japanese economic miracle. 　Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands. 　Tokyo is the second-largest urban economy worldwide by gross domestic product after New York City, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　It is also Japan's leading business hub as part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. 　As of 2021[update], Tokyo is home to 37 companies of the Fortune Global 500. 　In 2020, the city ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York City, London, and Shanghai. 　Tokyo is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree, and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (located in Kasukabe, Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo). 　The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia. 　Recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world, Tokyo was tied fourth with Wellington in the 2021 Global Livability Ranking. 　The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics (postponed; held in 2021), and three summits of the G7 (in 1979, 1986, and 1993). 　Tokyo is an international research and development hub and is likewise represented by several major universities, most notably the University of Tokyo. 　Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's high-speed railway network, the Shinkansen; Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is also the world's busiest train station. 　Notable special wards of Tokyo include: Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief>Belief</a> 

<font size=3>
A belief is a subjective attitude that something or proposition is true. 　In epistemology, philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either true or false. 　To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition "snow is white". 　However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. 　For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. 　Moreover, beliefs need not be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking "snow is white"), but can instead be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert "snow is white"). 　There are various ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone's actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). 　Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief ("either we have a belief or we don't have a belief") with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence ("there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief"). 　Beliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. 　Notable examples include: "What is the rational way to revise one's beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?", "Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I'm holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?", "How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?", and "Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting>Hunting</a> 

<font size=3>
Hunting is the human practice of seeking, pursuing, capturing, or killing wildlife or feral animals. 　The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to exploit the animal's body for food (i.e. meat) and useful animal products (fur/hide, bone/tusks, horn/antler, etc.), for recreation/taxidermy (see trophy hunting), although it may also be done for non-exploitative reasons such as removing predators dangerous to humans or domestic animals (e.g. wolf hunting), to eliminate pests and nuisance animals that damage crops/livestock/poultry or spread diseases (see varminting), for trade/tourism (see safari), or for ecological conservation against overpopulation and invasive species. 　Recreationally hunted species are generally referred to as the game, and are usually mammals and birds. 　A person participating in a hunt is a hunter or (less commonly) huntsman; a natural area used for hunting is called a game reserve; an experienced hunter who helps organize a hunt and/or manage the game reserve is known as a gamekeeper. 　Many non-human animals also hunt (see predation) as part of their feeding and parental behaviors, sometimes in quantities exceeding immediate dietary needs. 　The one that does the hunting is the predator, and the one being hunted is the prey. 　Hunting activities by humans arose in Homo erectus or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago. 　Hunting has become deeply embedded in various human cultures and was once an important part of the rural economies—classified by economists as part of primary production alongside forestry, agriculture and fishery. 　Modern regulations (see game law) distinguish lawful hunting activities from illegal poaching, which involves the unauthorized and unregulated killing, trapping or capture of animals. 　Apart from food provision, hunting can be a means of population control. 　Hunting advocates state that regulated hunting can be a necessary component of modern wildlife management, for example to help maintain a healthy proportion of animal populations within an environment's ecological carrying capacity when natural checks such as natural predators are absent or insufficient, or to provide funding for breeding programs and maintenance of natural reserves and conservation parks. 　However, excessive hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals. 　Some animal rights and anti-hunting activists regard hunting as a cruel, perverse and unnecessary blood sport. 　Certain hunting practices, such as canned hunts and ludicrously paid/bribed trophy tours (especially to poor countries), are considered unethical and exploitative even by some hunters. 　Marine mammals such as whales and pinnipeds are also targets of hunting, both recreationally and commercially, often with heated controversies regarding the morality, ethics and legality of such practices. 　The pursuit, harvesting or catch and release of fish and aquatic cephalopods and crustaceans is called fishing, which however is widely accepted and not commonly categorised as a form of hunting, even though it essentially is. 　It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, birdwatching, or scientific-research activities which involve tranquilizing or tagging of animals, although green hunting is still called so. 　The practices of netting or trapping insects and other arthropods for trophy collection, or the foraging or gathering of plants and mushrooms, are also not regarded as hunting. 　Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor for searching and obtaining something, as in "treasure hunting", "bargain hunting", "hunting for votes" and even "hunting down" corruption and waste.

Christopher is the English version of a Europe-wide name derived from the Greek name Χριστόφορος (Christophoros or Christoforos). 　The constituent parts are Χριστός (Christós), "Christ" or "Anointed", and φέρειν (phérein), "to bear"; hence the "Christ-bearer". 　As a given name, 'Christopher' has been in use since the 10th century. 　In English, Christopher may be abbreviated as "Chris", "Topher", and sometimes "Kit". 　It was frequently the most popular male first name in the United Kingdom, having been in the top twenty in England and Wales from the 1940s until 1995, although it has since dropped out of the top 100. 　The name is most common in England and not so common in Wales, Scotland, or Ireland.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault>Assault</a> 

<font size=3>
An assault is the act of illegally committing physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action. 　It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both. 　Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law. 　Traditionally, common law legal systems have separate definitions for assault and battery. 　When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. 　Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into a single crime called "assault and battery", which then became widely referred to as "assault". 　The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. 　The legal systems of civil law and Scots law have never distinguished assault from battery. 　Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. 　In the United States, an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony. 　In England and Wales and Australia, it can be charged as either common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) or grievous bodily harm (GBH). 　Canada also has a three-tier system: assault, assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault. 　Separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults, affray and assaulting a police officer. 　Assault may overlap with an attempted crime; for example an assault may be charged as an attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill.

A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. 　Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity which had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell. 　Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. 　Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens. 　Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph. 　All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.

<font size=3>
Surgery is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a person to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function, appearance, or to repair unwanted ruptured areas. 　The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, operation, or simply "surgery". 　In this context, the verb "operate" means to perform surgery. 　The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. 　The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. 　A surgeon is a person who practices surgery and a surgeon's assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. 　A surgical team is made up of the surgeon, the surgeon's assistant, an anaesthetist, a circulating nurse and a surgical technologist. 　Surgery usually spans from minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. 　The term "surgery" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.

A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. 　Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. 　Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. 　They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions. 　Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialized connective tissue. 　It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. 　Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. 　Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. 　Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. 　The mineralized matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. 　Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. 　Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage. 　In the human body at birth, there are approximately 300 bones present; many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. 　The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear. 　The Greek word for bone is ὀστέον ("osteon"), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. 　In anatomical terminology, including the Terminologia Anatomica international standard, the word for a bone is os (for example, os breve, os longum, os sesamoideum).

<font size=3>
Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth, proboscis, or elsewhere. 　Humans drink by swallowing, completed by peristalsis in the esophagus. 　The physiological processes of drinking vary widely among other animals. 　Most animals drink water to maintain bodily hydration, although many can survive on the water gained from their food. 　Water is required for many physiological processes. 　Both inadequate and (less commonly) excessive water intake are associated with health problems.

<font size=3>
In sociology, popularity is how much a person, idea, place, item or other concept is either liked or accorded status by other people. 　Liking can be due to reciprocal liking, interpersonal attraction, and similar factors. 　Social status can be due to dominance, superiority, and similar factors. 　For example, a kind person may be considered likable and therefore more popular than another person, and a wealthy person may be considered superior and therefore more popular than another person. 　There are two primary types of interpersonal popularity: perceived and sociometric. 　Perceived popularity is measured by asking people who the most popular or socially important people in their social group are. 　Sociometric popularity is measured by objectively measuring the number of connections a person has to others in the group. 　A person can have high perceived popularity without having high sociometric popularity, and vice versa. 　According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the Radboud University Nijmegen, "Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a group and having influence on it."

Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food, typically to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and to allow for growth. 　Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. 　Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. 　For humans, eating is an activity of daily living. 　Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. 　This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to hunger or famine, as part of a diet or as religious fasting.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(biology)>Flux (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In general, flux in biology relates to movement of a substance between compartments. 　There are several cases where the concept of flux is important. 　The movement of molecules across a membrane: in this case, flux is defined by the rate of diffusion or transport of a substance across a permeable membrane. 　Except in the case of active transport, net flux is directly proportional to the concentration difference across the membrane, the surface area of the membrane, and the membrane permeability constant. 　In ecology, flux is often considered at the ecosystem level – for instance, accurate determination of carbon fluxes using techniques like eddy covariance (at a regional and global level) is essential for modeling the causes and consequences of global warming. 　Metabolic flux refers to the rate of flow of metabolites through a biochemical network, along a linear metabolic pathway, or through a single enzyme. 　A calculation may also be made of carbon flux or flux of other elemental components of biomolecules (e.g. nitrogen). 　The general unit of flux is chemical mass /time (e.g., micromole/minute; mg/kg/minute). 　Flux rates are dependent on a number of factors, including: enzyme concentration; the concentration of precursor, product, and intermediate metabolites; post-translational modification of enzymes; and the presence of metabolic activators or repressors. 　Metabolic flux in biologic systems can refer to biosynthesis rates of polymers or other macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, polynucleotides, or complex carbohydrates, as well as the flow of intermediary metabolites through pathways. 　Metabolic control analysis and flux balance analysis provide frameworks for understanding metabolic fluxes and their constraints.

Flux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. 　Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications to physics. 　For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. 　In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface.

Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. 　It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. 　Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds. 　In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. 　It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. 　For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).

<font size=3>
Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. 　Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. 　Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response. 　Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. 　As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics. 　Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. 　While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest out of four primary strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as for training. 　There are various risks present during swimming, mainly due to it taking place in water. 　Swimmers are at risk of incapacitation due to panic and exhaustion, which may cause death due to drowning. 　Other dangers include getting an infection or contact with hostile aquatic fauna. 　To minimize these risks, most facilities employ a lifeguard to look for signs of distress. 　Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the culture of the area, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. 　In addition to this, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.

<font size=3>
Quebec (/k(w)ɪˈbɛk/ k(w)ih-BEK; French: Québec [kebɛk] (listen)) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. 　It is the largest province by area and the second-largest by population. 　Much of the population lives in urban areas along the St. Lawrence River, between the most populous city, Montreal, and the provincial capital, Quebec City. 　Quebec is the home of the Québécois nation. 　Located in Central Canada, the province shares land borders with Ontario to the west, Newfoundland and Labrador to the northeast, New Brunswick to the southeast, and a coastal border with Nunavut; in the south it borders Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York in the United States. 　Between 1534 and 1763, Quebec was called Canada and was the most developed colony in New France. 　Following the Seven Years' War, Quebec became a British colony: first as the Province of Quebec (1763–1791), then Lower Canada (1791–1841), and lastly Canada East (1841–1867), as a result of the Lower Canada Rebellion. 　It was confederated with Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in 1867, beginning the Dominion of Canada. 　Until the early 1960s, the Catholic Church played a large role in the social and cultural institutions in Quebec. 　However, the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1980s increased the role of the Government of Quebec in l'État québécois (the state of Quebec). 　The Government of Quebec functions within the context of a Westminster system and is both a liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy. 　The Premier of Quebec, presently François Legault, acts as head of government. 　Québécois political culture mostly differs on a nationalist-vs-federalist continuum, rather than a left-vs-right continuum. 　Independence debates have played a large role in politics. 　Quebec society's cohesion and specificity is based on three of its unique statutory documents: the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, the Charter of the French Language, and the Civil Code of Quebec. 　Furthermore, unlike elsewhere in Canada, law in Quebec is mixed: private law is exercised under a civil-law system, while public law is exercised under a common-law system. 　Quebec's official language is French; Québécois French is the regional variety. 　The economy of Quebec is mainly supported by its large service sector and varied industrial sector. 　For exports, it leans on the key industries of aeronautics, hydroelectricity, mining, pharmaceuticals, aluminum, wood, and paper. 　Quebec is well known for producing maple syrup, for its comedy, and for making hockey one of the most popular sports in Canada. 　It is also renowned for its culture; the province produces literature, music, films, TV shows, festivals, folklore, and more.

<font size=3>
Sharing is the joint use of a resource or space. 　It is also the process of dividing and distributing. 　In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common pasture or a shared residence. 　Still more loosely, "sharing" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to "share" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. 　Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being. 　Apart from obvious instances, which can be observed in human activity, many examples can be found in nature. 　When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen, for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. 　Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. 　In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as nonrival goods, such as information.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention>Intention</a> 

<font size=3>
Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action. 　Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention. 　The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content. 　Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan. 　Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so. 　Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs. 　Theories of intention try to capture the characteristic features of intentions. 　The belief-desire theory is the traditionally dominant approach. 　According to a simple version of it, having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action. 　Belief-desire theories are frequently criticized based on the fact that neither beliefs nor desires involve a practical commitment to performing an action, which is often illustrated in various counterexamples. 　The evaluation theory tries to overcome this problem by explaining intentions in terms of unconditional evaluations. 　That is to say that intentions do not just present the intended course of action as good in some respect, as is the case for desires, but as good all things considered. 　This approach has problems in explaining cases of akrasia, i.e. that agents do not always intend what they see as the best course of action. 　A closely related theory identifies intentions not with unconditional evaluations but with predominant desires. 　It states that intending to do something consists in desiring it the most. 　Opponents of this approach have articulated various counterexamples with the goal of showing that intentions do not always coincide with the agent's strongest desire. 　A different approach to the theories mentioned so far is due to Elizabeth Anscombe and denies the distinction between intentions and actions. 　On her view, to intend a goal is already a form of acting towards this goal and therefore not a distinct mental state. 　This account struggles to explain cases in which intentions and actions seem to come apart, as when the agent is not currently doing anything towards realizing their plan or in the case of failed actions. 　The self-referentiality theory suggests that intentions are self-referential, i.e. that they do not just represent the intended course of action but also represent themselves as the cause of the action. 　But the claim that this happens on the level of the content of the intention has been contested. 　The term "intention" refers to a group of related phenomena. 　For this reason, theorists often distinguish various types of intentions in order to avoid misunderstandings. 　The most-discussed distinction is that between prospective and immediate intentions. 　Prospective intentions, also known as "prior intentions", involve plans for the future. 　They can be subdivided according to how far they plan ahead: proximal intentions involve plans for what one wants to do straightaway whereas distal intentions are concerned with a more remote future. 　Immediate intentions, on the other hand, are intentions that guide the agent while they are performing the action in question. 　They are also called "intentions-in-action" or "act-related" intentions. 　The term "intention" usually refers to anticipated means or ends that motivate the agent. 　But in some cases, it can refer to anticipated side-effects that are neither means nor ends to the agent. 　In this case, the term "oblique intention" is sometimes used. 　Intentions are rationally evaluable: they are either rational or irrational. 　Conscious intentions are the paradigmatic form of intention: in them, the agent is aware of their goals. 　But it has been suggested that actions can also be guided by unconscious intentions of which the agent is not aware. 　The formation of intentions is sometimes preceded by the deliberation of promising alternative courses of action and may happen in decisions, in which the agent chooses between these alternatives. 　Intentions are responsible for initiating, sustaining, and terminating actions and are frequently used to explain why people engage in a certain behavior. 　Understanding the behavior of others in terms of intentions already happens in early childhood. 　Important in this context is the role of gestures, pointing, attention, and eye movement to understand the intentions of others and to form shared intentions. 　In the philosophy of action, a central question is whether it is true for all intentional actions that they are caused or accompanied by intentions. 　The theory of reasoned action aims to predict behavior based on how pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms determine behavioral intentions. 　In ethics, the intention principle states that whether an action is morally permissible sometimes depends on the agent's intention for performing this action.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter>Charter</a> 

<font size=3>
A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. 　It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and it is that sense which is retained in modern usage of the term. 　The word entered the English language from the Old French charte, via Latin chartacode: lat promoted to code: la , and ultimately from Greek χάρτης (khartes, meaning "layer of papyrus"). 　It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule>Schedule</a> 

<font size=3>
A schedule or a timetable, as a basic time-management tool, consists of a list of times at which possible tasks, events, or actions are intended to take place, or of a sequence of events in the chronological order in which such things are intended to take place. 　The process of creating a schedule — deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the variety of possible tasks — is called scheduling, and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may be called a scheduler. 　Making and following schedules is an ancient human activity. 　Some scenarios associate this kind of planning with learning life skills. 　Schedules are necessary, or at least useful, in situations where individuals need to know what time they must be at a specific location to receive a specific service, and where people need to accomplish a set of goals within a set time period. 　Schedules can usefully span both short periods, such as a daily or weekly schedule, and long-term planning with respect to periods of several months or years. 　They are often made using a calendar, where the person making the schedule can note the dates and times at which various events are planned to occur. 　Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list algorithmically an expected order in which events either can or must take place. 　In some situations, schedules can be uncertain, such as where the conduct of daily life relies on environmental factors outside human control. 　People who are vacationing or otherwise seeking to reduce stress and achieve relaxation may intentionally avoid having a schedule for a certain period of time.

An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. 　Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. 　Alternate terms include auntie or aunty. 　Children in other cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap. 　The word comes from Latin: amita via Old French ante and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. 　The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing>Marketing</a> 

<font size=3>
Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. 　Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. 　Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. 　More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination. 　It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. 　Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). 　Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. 　Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing. 　The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product's target market. 　Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements. 　The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut>Connecticut</a> 

<font size=3>
Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ (listen)) is the southernmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. 　Its capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. 　Historically, the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey. 　The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. 　The word "Connecticut" is derived from various anglicized spellings of "Quinnetuket”, a Mohegan-Pequot word for "long tidal river". Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called House of Hope in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. Connecticut was one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution. It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. Connecticut is the third smallest state by area, the 29th most populous, and the fourth most densely populated of the fifty states. It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". 　The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. 　The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford County and hedge funds in Fairfield County. 　As of the 2010 census, it has the highest per-capita income, second-highest level of human development behind Massachusetts, and highest median household income in the United States.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 56°N 10°E﻿ / ﻿56°N 10°E﻿ / 56; 10 Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic constituent country in Northern Europe. 　It is the most populous and politically central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean. 　Metropolitan Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying south-west of Sweden, south of Norway, and north of Germany. 　As of 2013, the Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, has a total of 1,419 islands above 100 square metres (1,100 sq ft); 443 of which have been named and of which 78 are inhabited. 　Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi), metropolitan Denmark consists of the northern part of the Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands. 　Of these, the most populated island is Zealand, on which the capital Copenhagen is situated, followed by Funen, the North Jutlandic Island, and Amager. 　Denmark's geography is characterised by flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevation, and a temperate climate. 　As of 2022, it had a population of 5.928 million (1 October 2022), of which 800,000 live in the capital and largest city, Copenhagen. 　Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. 　Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the latter obtained further autonomy in 2009. 　The unified Kingdom of Denmark emerged in the eighth century as a proficient maritime power amid the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. 　In 1397, it joined Norway and Sweden to form the Kalmar Union, which persisted until the latter's secession in 1523. 　The remaining Kingdom of Denmark–Norway endured a series of wars in the 17th century that resulted in further territorial cessions to the Swedish Empire. 　Following the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was absorbed into Sweden, leaving Denmark with the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. 　A surge of nationalist movements in the 19th century were defeated in the First Schleswig War of 1848, though the Second Schleswig War of 1864 resulted in further territorial losses to Prussia. 　The period saw the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy that was established in 1660 and introducing the current parliamentary system. 　An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century, which formed the basis for the present welfare state model and advanced mixed economy. 　Denmark remained neutral during World War I but regained the northern half of Schleswig in 1920. 　Danish neutrality was violated in World War II following a swift German invasion in April 1940. 　During occupation, a resistance movement emerged in 1943 while Iceland declared independence in 1944; Denmark was liberated in May 1945. 　In 1973, Denmark, together with Greenland but not the Faroes, became a member of what is now the European Union, but negotiated certain opt-outs, such as retaining its own currency, the krone. 　Denmark is a highly developed country with a high standard of living: the country performs at or near the top in measures of education, health care, civil liberties, democratic governance and LGBT equality. 　Denmark is a founding member of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area. 　Denmark maintains close political, cultural, and linguistic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours, with the Danish language being partially mutually intelligible with both Norwegian and Swedish.

Listening is giving attention to a sound or action. 　When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. 　The act of listening involves complex affective, cognitive and behavioral processes. 　Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. 　Listening is a skill for creating problems. 　Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or a dispute. 　Other causes can be excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, and having a closed mind. 　Listening is also linked to memory. 　According to one study, during a speech some background noises heard by listeners helped them recall some of the information by hearing it again. 　For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. 　Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting the cross-culture communicative discourses. 　Ratcliffe built her argument upon two incidents in which individuals demonstrated a tendency to refuse the cross-cultural discourses.

<font size=3>
A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. 　Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage. 　Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami). 　There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: the former, except for February 29, occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the complete date when a person was born (e.g. January 15, 2001).

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 50°50′N 4°00′E﻿ / ﻿50.833°N 4.000°E﻿ / 50.833; 4.000 Belgium, officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a country in Northwestern Europe. 　The country is bordered by the Netherlands to the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast, France to the southwest, and the North Sea to the northwest. 　It covers an area of 30,528 km2 (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5 million, making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe, with a density of 376/km2 (970/sq mi). 　Belgium is part of an area known as the Low Countries, historically a somewhat larger region than the Benelux group of states, as it also included parts of northern France. 　The capital and largest city is Brussels; other major cities are Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège, Bruges, Namur, and Leuven. 　Belgium is a sovereign state and a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. 　Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. 　It is divided into three highly autonomous regions: the Flemish Region (Flanders) in the north, the Walloon Region (Wallonia) in the south, and the Brussels-Capital Region. 　Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita. 　Belgium is also home to two main linguistic communities: the Flemish Community, which constitutes about 60 percent of the population, and the French Community, which constitutes about 40 percent of the population. 　A small German-speaking Community, numbering around one percent, exists in the East Cantons. 　The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, although French is the dominant language. 　Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its complex system of governance, made up of six different governments. 　Since the Middle Ages, Belgium's central location near several major rivers has meant that the area has been relatively prosperous, connected commercially and politically to its bigger neighbours. 　The country as it exists today was established following the 1830 Belgian Revolution, when it seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which had incorporated the Southern Netherlands (which comprised most of modern-day Belgium) after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. 　The name chosen for the new state is derived from the Latin word Belgium, used in Julius Caesar's "Gallic Wars", to describe a nearby region in the period around 55 BCE. 　Belgium has also been the battleground of European powers, earning the moniker the "Battlefield of Europe", a reputation reinforced in the 20th century by both world wars. 　Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution, and during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. 　Between 1885 and 1908, the Congo Free State, which was privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium, was characterized by widespread atrocities and disease, leading to a population decline of millions; amid public outcry in Europe, Belgium annexed the territory as a colony. 　The Belgian colonial empire gained independence between 1960 and 1962. 　The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fuelled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. 　This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching state reforms, resulting in the transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement between 1970 and 1993. 　Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly among the Flemish; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election, a world record. 　Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the Second World War. 　Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the European Union, and its capital, Brussels, is also the de facto capital of the European Union itself, hosting the official seats of the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Council, as well as one of two seats of the European Parliament (the other being Strasbourg). 　Belgium is also a founding member of the Eurozone, NATO, OECD, and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the Schengen Area. 　Brussels also hosts the headquarters of many major international organizations, such as NATO. 　Belgium is a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy. 　It has very high standards of living, quality of life, health care, education, and is categorized as "very high" on the Human Development Index. 　It also ranks relatively high on the Global Peace Index.

Coordinates: 5°S 120°E﻿ / ﻿5°S 120°E﻿ / -5; 120 Indonesia, officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a transcontinental country spanning the southeastern part of Asia and western part of Oceania between the Indian and Pacific oceans. 　It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. 　Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). 　With over 275 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. 　Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population. 　Indonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. 　It has 38 provinces, of which nine have special status. 　The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's second-most populous urban area. 　Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). 　Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity. 　The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh century, when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China. 　Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. 　Under Indian influence, Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE. 　Muslim traders later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. 　Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II. 　Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, corruption, separatism, a democratisation process, and periods of rapid economic change. 　Indonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. 　A shared identity has developed with the motto "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity" literally, "many, yet one"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. 　The economy of Indonesia is the world's 17th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. 　It is a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. 　The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

<font size=3>
Detroit (/dəˈtrɔɪt/ də-TROYT, locally also /ˈdiːtrɔɪt/ DEE-troyt; French: Détroit, lit. 'strait') is the largest city in the U.S. state of Michigan. 　It is also the largest U.S. city on the United States–Canada border, and the seat of government of Wayne County. 　The City of Detroit had a population of 639,111 at the 2020 census, making it the 27th-most populous city in the United States. 　The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million people, making it the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area, and the 14th-largest in the United States. 　Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to music, art, architecture and design, in addition to its historical automotive background. 　Time named Detroit as one of the fifty World's Greatest Places of 2022 to explore. 　Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 　The City of Detroit anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest, behind Chicago and Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and the 16th-largest in the United States. 　Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the "Big Three" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler) are all headquartered in Metro Detroit. 　As of 2007[update], the Detroit metropolitan area is the number one exporting region among 310 defined metropolitan areas in the United States. 　The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hub airports in the United States. 　Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected through a highway tunnel, railway tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge, which is the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana. 　Both cities will soon be connected by a new bridge currently under construction, the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will provide a complete freeway-to-freeway link. 　The new bridge is expected to be open by 2024. 　In 1701, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the future city of Detroit. 　During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. 　The city's population became the fourth-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia, with the expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century. 　As Detroit's industrialization took off, the Detroit River became the busiest commercial hub in the world. 　The strait carried over 65 million tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world each year; the freight throughput was more than three times that of New York and about four times that of London. 　By the 1940s, the city's population remained the fourth-largest in the country. 　However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization, among other reasons, Detroit entered a state of urban decay and lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. 　Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 65 percent. 　In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances. 　Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. 　The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. 　Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. 　More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other neighborhoods have increased.　[citation needed] An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 16 million visitors per year. 　In 2015, Detroit was named a "City of Design" by UNESCO, the first U.S. city to receive that designation.

<font size=3>
Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. 　Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for meat since prehistoric times. 　The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. 　This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses. 　Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. 　It is edible raw but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. 　Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with, and decomposition by, bacteria and fungi. 　Meat is important to the food industry, economies, and cultures around the world. 　There are nonetheless people who choose to not eat meat (vegetarians) or any animal products (vegans), for reasons such as taste preferences, ethics, environmental concerns, health concerns or religious dietary rules.

Nanna, Sīn /ˈsiːn/ or Suen (Akkadian: 𒂗𒍪 EN.ZU, pronounced Su'en, Sen, Sîn), and in Aramaic syn, syn’, or even shr 'moon', or Nannar (Sumerian: 𒀭𒋀𒆠 DŠEŠ.KI, DNANNAR) was the god of the moon in the Mesopotamian religions of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia and Aram. 　He was also associated with cattle, perhaps due to the perceived similarity between bull horns and the crescent moon. 　He was always described as a major deity, though only a few sources, mostly these from the reign of Nabonidus, consider him to be the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon. 　The two chief seats of his worship were Ur in the south of Mesopotamia and Harran in the north, though he was also worshiped in numerous other cities, especially in the proximity of Ur and in the Diyala area. 　In Ur, he was connected to royal power, and many Mesopotamian kings visited his temple in this city. 　According to Mesopotamian mythology, his parents were Enlil and Ninlil, while his wife was Ningal, worshiped with him in his major cult centers. 　Their children included major deities Innanna (Ishtar) and Utu (Shamash) and minor gods such as Ningublaga and Numushda. 　Some deities, for example Nanaya and Pinikir, were sometimes regarded as his children due to syncretism between them and his daughter Ishtar. 　Nanna acquired a number of syncretic associations himself, and the logographic writings of his name were used to represent these of other moon gods, such as Ugaritic Yarikh or Hurrian Kusuh.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral>Integral</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. 　Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operation of calculus, the other being differentiation. 　Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. 　Today integration is used in a wide variety of scientific fields. 　The integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. 　Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. 　Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. 　In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. 　The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known. 　Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. 　Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs. 　In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more robust than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable. 　Integrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. 　For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. 　In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon>Demon</a> 

<font size=3>
A demon is a malevolent supernatural entity. 　Historically, belief in demons, or stories about demons, occurs in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology, and folklore; as well as in media such as comics, video games, movies, anime, and television series. 　Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from humanity's fear of the unknown, the strange and the horrific. 　In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including early Judaism and ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. 　Large portions of Jewish demonology, a key influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism, and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era. 　Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils: minions of the Devil. 　In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc.). 　In religions featuring a principal Devil (e.g. Satan) locked in an eternal struggle with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil. 　As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions. 　The original Ancient Greek word daimōn (δαίμων) did not carry negative connotations, as it denotes a spirit or divine power. 　The Greek conception of a daimōn notably appears in the philosophical works of Plato, where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates. 　In Christianity, morally ambivalent daimōn were replaced by demons, forces of evil only striving for corruption. 　Such demons are not the Greek intermediary spirits, but hostile entities, already known in Iranian beliefs. 　In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology, a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled. 　Belief in demons remains an important part of many modern religions and occultist traditions. 　Demons are still feared largely due to their alleged power to possess living creatures. 　In the contemporary Western occultist tradition (perhaps epitomized by the work of Aleister Crowley), a demon (such as Choronzon, which is Crowley's interpretation of the so-called "Demon of the Abyss") is a useful metaphor for certain inner psychological processes (inner demons), though some may also regard it as an objectively real phenomenon.

<font size=3>
In music, an arrangement is a musical adaptation of an existing composition. 　Differences from the original composition may include reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or formal development. 　Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. 　Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings. Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety". 　In jazz, a memorized (unwritten) arrangement of a new or pre-existing composition is known as a head arrangement.

<font size=3>
A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). 　A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church, or temple, and may also serve as an oratory, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. 　A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, balneary and infirmary, and outlying granges. 　Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. 　These may include a hospice, a school, and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge, or a brewery. 　In English usage, the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. 　In modern usage, convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters. 　Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a friary. 　Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.

<font size=3>
Resource refers to all the materials available in our environment which are technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally sustainable and help us to satisfy our needs and wants. 　Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability — they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources. 　They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of the level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localised (private, community-owned, national and international resources). 　An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology. 　The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being. 　From a human perspective, a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. 　From a broader biological or ecological perspective, a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). 　The concept of resources has been developed across many established areas of work, in economics, biology and ecology, computer science, management, and human resources for example - linked to the concepts of competition, sustainability, conservation, and stewardship. 　In application within human society, commercial or non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource management. 　The concept of a resource can also be tied to the direction of leadership over resources, this can include the things leaders have responsibility for over the human resources, with management, help, support or direction such as in charge of a professional group, technical experts, innovative leaders, archiving expertise, academic management, association management, business management, healthcare management, military management, public administration, spiritual leadership and social networking administrator.

vi (pronounced as distinct letters, /ˌviːˈaɪ/) is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. 　The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX. 　The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley. 　Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978. 　It was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second BSD in May 1979 that the editor was installed under the name "vi" (which took users straight into ex's visual mode), and the name by which it is known today. 　Some current implementations of vi can trace their source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new, largely compatible reimplementations.　[citation needed][discuss] The name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command visual, which switches the ex line editor to its full-screen mode. 　The name is pronounced /ˌviːˈaɪ/ (the English letters v and i). 　In addition to various non–free software variants of vi distributed with proprietary implementations of Unix, vi was opensourced with OpenSolaris, and several free and open source software vi clones exist. 　A 2009 survey of Linux Journal readers found that vi was the most widely used text editor among respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor, by nearly a factor of two (36% to 19%).

An abbey is a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. 　Abbeys provide a complex of buildings and land for religious activities, work, and housing of Christian monks and nuns. 　The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. 　Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. 　An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. 　The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. 　Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted, or education to the young. 　Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. 　There are many famous abbeys across the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.

Coordinates: 47°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿47°N 20°E﻿ / 47; 20 Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarország [ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ] (listen)) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. 　Spanning 93,030 square kilometres (35,920 sq mi) of the Carpathian Basin, it is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to the south, Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest, and Austria to the west. 　Hungary has a population of 9.7 million, mostly ethnic Hungarians and a significant Romani minority. 　Hungarian, the official language, is the world's most widely spoken Uralic language and among the few non-Indo-European languages widely spoken in Europe. 　Budapest is the country's capital and largest city; other major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs, and Győr. 　The territory of present-day Hungary has for centuries been a crossroads for various peoples, including Celts, Romans, Germanic tribes, Huns, West Slavs and the Avars. 　The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century AD with the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by Hungarian grand prince Árpád. 　His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. 　By the 12th century, Hungary became a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. 　Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, it was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire (1541–1699). 　Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary, a major power into the early 20th century. 　Austria-Hungary collapsed after World War I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. 　Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. 　Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. 　Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc. 　The removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and subsequently the Soviet Union. 　On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic. 　Hungary joined the European Union in 2004 and has been part of the Schengen Area since 2007. 　Hungary is a middle power in international affairs, owing mostly to its cultural and economic influence. 　It is a high-income economy with a very high human development index, where citizens enjoy universal health care and tuition-free secondary education. 　Hungary has a long history of significant contributions to arts, music, literature, sports, science and technology. 　It is a popular tourist destination in Europe, drawing 24.5 million international tourists in 2019. 　It is a member of numerous international organisations, including the Council of Europe, NATO, United Nations, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Investment Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Visegrád Group.

Look up bomb in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. 　Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. 　Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia. 　The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a "bomb". 　The military use of the term "bomb", or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation. 　Other military explosive weapons not classified as "bombs" include shells, depth charges (used in water), or land mines. 　In unconventional warfare, other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. 　For instance, in recent Middle Eastern conflicts, homemade bombs called "improvised explosive devices" (IEDs) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness. 　The word comes from the Latin bombus, which in turn comes from the Greek βόμβος romanized bombos, an onomatopoetic term meaning 'booming', 'buzzing'.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting>Cutting</a> 

<font size=3>
Cutting is the separation or opening of a physical object, into two or more portions, through the application of an acutely directed force. 　Implements commonly used for cutting are the knife and saw, or in medicine and science the scalpel and microtome. 　However, any sufficiently sharp object is capable of cutting if it has a hardness sufficiently larger than the object being cut, and if it is applied with sufficient force. 　Even liquids can be used to cut things when applied with sufficient force (see water jet cutter). 　Cutting is a compressive and shearing phenomenon, and occurs only when the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. 　The simplest applicable equation is: stress = force area {\displaystyle {\text{stress}}={{\text{force}} \over {\text{area}}}} or τ = F A {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {F}{A}}} The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional to the area of contact. 　Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement), the less force is needed to cut something. 　It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. 　This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the easy cutting action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix>Prix</a> 

<font size=3>
Prix was an American power pop band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1975 by Tommy Hoehn and Jon Tiven. 　The group ended up primarily as a studio project. 　Its recordings were produced by Tiven along with former Big Star member Chris Bell, who also played guitar and sang backup vocals. 　Prix is also famous of Banjo playing. 　Alex Chilton also participated in the recordings, along with session drummer Hilly Michaels. 　Although the group generated some major record label interest—notably from Mercury Records and Columbia/CBS Records—it ultimately only released a double A-side single on Ork Records in 1977 and a single on Miracle Records in 1978. 　Its only live performance came at a CBS Records showcase in 1976. 　In 1977, just as Ork Records released the first single and booked the group at CBGB, Prix broke up due both to Hoehn's unwillingness to remain in New York and to creative differences. 　In 1978, two of the songs recorded during the Prix sessions were included on Losing You to Sleep, Hoehn's major label solo debut on London Records. 　In 2002, the Japanese label Air Mail Music released Historix, a CD-only collection of all eleven songs recorded by Prix, plus four alternate versions. 　Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the songs as "11 sparkling, diamond-hard pop gems that will prove to be irresistible to power pop fanatics." 　In 2015, six of the songs were released on the compilation Ork Records: New York, New York. 　In 2016, HoZac Records re-released Historix on vinyl and CD.

A pandemic (/pænˈdɛmɪk/ pan-DEM-ik) is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of individuals. 　A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected individuals is not a pandemic. 　Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected individuals such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide. 　Throughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox. 　The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death—also known as The Plague—which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century. 　The term had not been used then but was used for later epidemics, including the 1918 influenza pandemic—more commonly known as the Spanish flu. 　Current pandemics include HIV/AIDS and COVID-19.

A trophy is a tangible, durable reminder of a specific achievement, and serves as a recognition or evidence of merit. 　Trophies are often awarded for sporting events, from youth sports to professional level athletics. 　In many sports medals (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies. 　Originally the word trophy, derived from the Greek tropaion, referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., headhunting) captured in battle. 　These war trophies commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. 　In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged, but this sense of the word is reflected in hunting trophies and human trophy collecting by serial killers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation>Explanation</a> 

<font size=3>
An explanation is a set of statements usually constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context, and consequences of those facts. 　It may establish rules or laws, and may clarify the existing rules or laws in relation to any objects or phenomena examined. 　Explanation, in philosophy, is a set of statements that makes intelligible the existence or occurrence of an object, event, or state of affairs. 　Among its most common forms are: Causal explanation Deductive-nomological explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization from which it may be derived in a deductive argument (e.g., “All gases expand when heated; this gas was heated; therefore, this gas expanded”) Statistical explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization that gives it inductive support (e.g., “Most people who use tobacco contract cancer; this person used tobacco; therefore, this person contracted cancer”). 　Explanations of human behaviour typically appeal to the subject’s beliefs and desires, as well as other facts about him, and proceed on the assumption that the behaviour in question is rational (at least to a minimum degree). 　Thus an explanation of why the subject removed his coat might cite the fact that the subject felt hot, that the subject desired to feel cooler, and that the subject believed that he would feel cooler if he took off his coat.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty>Liberty</a> 

<font size=3>
Liberty is the ability to do as one pleases, or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant (i.e. privilege). 　It is a synonym for the word freedom. 　In modern politics, liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. 　In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties". 　Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. 　In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. 　Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. 　Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. 　In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts. 　Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas, derived from the name of the goddess Libertas, who, along with more modern personifications, is often used to portray the concept, and the archaic Roman god Liber.　[citation needed] The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as in "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".

<font size=3>
The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures that are held to be sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other religions. 　The Bible is an anthology – a compilation of texts of a variety of forms – originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. 　These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, among other genres. 　The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. 　Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and interpret the text can vary. 　The religious texts were compiled by different religious communities into various official collections. 　The earliest contained the first five books of the Bible. 　It is called the Torah in Hebrew and the Pentateuch (meaning five books) in Greek; the second oldest part was a collection of narrative histories and prophecies (the Nevi'im); the third collection (the Ketuvim) contains psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories. 　"Tanakh" is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of those three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah ("Teaching"), the Nevi'im ("Prophets"), and the Ketuvim ("Writings"). 　The Masoretic Text is the medieval version of the Tanakh, in Hebrew and Aramaic, that is considered the authoritative text of the Hebrew Bible by modern Rabbinic Judaism. 　The Septuagint (meaning the Translation of the Seventy) is a Koine Greek translation of the Tanakh from the third and second centuries BCE (Before Common Era); it largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible. 　Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the Old Testament. 　The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books. 　The gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts quickly coalesced into the New Testament. 　With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is the best-selling publication of all time. 　It has had a profound influence both on Western culture and history and on cultures around the globe. 　The study of it through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well. 　The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.

A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. 　Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. 　All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. 　Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. 　For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for "STOP"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. 　Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. 　The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.　[citation needed] The academic study of symbols is semiotics. 　In cartography, an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology)>Nu (mythology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Nu ("Watery One") or Nun ("The Inert One") (Ancient Egyptian: nnw Nānaw; Coptic: Ⲛⲟⲩⲛ Noun), is the personification of the primordial watery abyss which existed at the time of creation and from which the creator sun god Ra arose, in ancient Egyptian religion. 　Nu is one of the eight deities of the Ogdoad representing ancient Egyptian primordial Chaos from which the primordial mound arose. 　Nun can be seen as the first of all the gods and the creator of reality and personification of the cosmos. 　Nun is also considered the god that will destroy existence and return everything to the Nun from whence it came. 　No cult was addressed to Nun. 　The consort of Nun was the goddess Nunut or Naunet (Ancient Egyptian: nnwt). 　The names of Nu and Naunet are written with the determiners for sky and water.

<font size=3>
In accounting, revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business. 　Commercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. 　Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other fees. 　"Revenue" may refer to income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit, earned during a period of time, as in "Last year, Company X had revenue of $42 million". 　Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total expenses in a given period. 　In accounting, in the balance statement, revenue is a subsection of the Equity section and revenue increases equity, it is often referred to as the "top line" due to its position on the income statement at the very top. 　This is to be contrasted with the "bottom line" which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses). 　In general usage, revenue is the total amount of income by the sale of goods or services related to the company's operations. 　Sales revenue is income received from selling goods or services over a period of time. 　Tax revenue is income that a government receives from taxpayers. 　Fundraising revenue is income received by a charity from donors etc. to further its social purposes. 　In more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income based on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a government or government agency. 　Two common accounting methods, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for measuring revenue. 　Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are usually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting principles or on International Financial Reporting Standards. 　In a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger accounts that are summarized periodically under the heading "Revenue" or "Revenues" on an income statement. 　Revenue account-names describe the type of revenue, such as "repair service revenue", "rent revenue earned" or "sales".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle>Rifle</a> 

<font size=3>
A rifle is a long-barreled firearm designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall. 　In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting. 　Rifles are used extensively in warfare, law enforcement, hunting, shooting sports, and crime. 　The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools. 　By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun rifle is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger (e.g., personnel halting and stimulation response rifle, which is actually a laser dazzler). 　Like all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other propulsive means are used, such as compressed air in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (plinking). 　The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns (e.g., arquebuses, muskets) is the rifling within its barrel. 　The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called lands; they make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin. 　When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, increasing accuracy and hence effective range. 　Early long rifles were muzzle-loaders firing spherical balls; the introduction of breech-loading allowed the use of elongated and aerodynamically efficient bullets, which did not yaw or tumble significantly in flight due to the spin.　[citation needed]
