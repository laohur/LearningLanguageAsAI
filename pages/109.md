## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism>Terrorism</a> 
<font size=3>
Terrorism, in its broadest sense, is the use of criminal violence to provoke a state of terror or fear, mostly with the intention to achieve political or religious aims. 　The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). 　The terms "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Basque conflict, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. 　The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States. 　There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it. 　Terrorism is a charged term. 　It is often used with the connotation of something that is "morally wrong". 　Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. 　Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. 　These include left-wing and right-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. 　Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states. 　State terrorism is that perpetrated by nation states, but is not considered such by the state conducting it, making legality a grey area. 　There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime. 　The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.

<font size=3>
Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented. 　Propaganda can be found in news and journalism, government, advertising, entertainment, education, and activism and is often associated with material which is prepared by governments as part of war efforts, political campaigns, health campaigns, revolutionaries, big businesses, ultra-religious organizations, the media, and certain individuals such as soapboxers. 　In the 20th century, the English term propaganda was often associated with a manipulative approach, but historically, propaganda has been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies. 　Equivalent non-English terms have also largely retained the original neutral connotation.　[citation needed] A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. 　More recently, the digital age has given rise to new ways of disseminating propaganda, for example, bots and algorithms are currently being used to create computational propaganda and fake or biased news and spread it on social media.

<font size=3>
Bacteria (/bækˈtɪəriə/ (listen); singular: bacterium) are ubiquitous, mostly free-living organisms often consisting of one biological cell. 　They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. 　Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. 　Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth's crust. 　Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. 　The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. 　In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. 　Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. 　Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory. 　The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. 　Humans and most other animals carry millions of bacteria. 　Most are in the gut, and there are many on the skin. 　Most of the bacteria in and on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system, and many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. 　However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis, tetanus and bubonic plague. 　The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. 　Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. 　Bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals. 　Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes ("fission fungi"), bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. 　Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. 　Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. 　These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.

<font size=3>
Diana is a goddess in Roman and Hellenistic religion, primarily considered a patroness of the countryside, hunters, crossroads, and the Moon. 　She is equated with the Greek goddess Artemis, and absorbed much of Artemis' mythology early in Roman history, including a birth on the island of Delos to parents Jupiter and Latona, and a twin brother, Apollo, though she had an independent origin in Italy. 　Diana is considered a virgin goddess and protector of childbirth. 　Historically, Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities: Egeria the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and Virbius, the woodland god. 　Diana is revered in modern neopagan religions including Roman neopaganism, Stregheria, and Wicca. 　In the ancient, medieval, and modern periods, Diana has been considered a triple deity, merged with a goddess of the moon (Luna/Selene) and the underworld (usually Hecate).

Coordinates: 1°N 32°E﻿ / ﻿1°N 32°E﻿ / 1; 32 Uganda (Yuganda in Ugandan languages), officially the Republic of Uganda (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Uganda), is a landlocked country in East Africa. 　The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. 　The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. 　Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region. 　Uganda also lies within the Nile basin and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate. 　It has a population of around 49 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala. 　Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the country. 　From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established administrative law across the territory. 　Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. 　The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long military dictatorship led by Idi Amin. 　The official language is English, although the Constitution states that "any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law." 　Luganda, a central region-based language, is widely spoken across the Central and South Eastern regions of the country, and several other languages are also spoken, including Ateso, Lango, Acholi, Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, Luo, Rutooro, Samia, Jopadhola, and Lusoga. 　In 2005 Swahili, which is foreign and so viewed as being neutral, was proposed as the Uganda's second official language. 　But this has yet to be ratified by parliament. 　In 2022 Uganda has decided to make Swahili a mandatory subject in the school curriculum. 　Uganda's current president is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who took power in January 1986 after a protracted six-year guerrilla war. 　Following constitutional amendments that removed term limits for the president, he was able to stand and was elected president in the 2011, 2016 and 2021 general elections.

<font size=3>
Granite (/ˈɡrænɪt/) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. 　It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. 　It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions. 　These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers. 　Granite is typical of a larger family of granitic rocks, or granitoids, that are composed mostly of coarse-grained quartz and feldspars in varying proportions. 　These rocks are classified by the relative percentages of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase (the QAPF classification), with true granite representing granitic rocks rich in quartz and alkali feldspar. 　Most granitic rocks also contain mica or amphibole minerals, though a few (known as leucogranites) contain almost no dark minerals. 　Granite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures), hard, and tough. 　These properties have made granite a widespread construction stone throughout human history.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald>Herald</a> 
<font size=3>
A herald, or a herald of arms, is an officer of arms, ranking between pursuivant and king of arms. 　The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms. 　Heralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey messages or proclamations—in this sense being the predecessors of modern diplomats. 　In the Hundred Years' War, French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. 　During the Battle of Agincourt, the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle. 　Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a tabard, decorated with the coat of arms of his master. 　It was possibly due to their role in managing the tournaments of the Late Middle Ages that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' coats of arms. 　Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. 　Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament. 　This practice of heraldry became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. 　In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the royal coat of arms. 　There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. 　In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called "Heralds of Arms in Ordinary". 　Temporary appointments can be made of "Heralds of Arms Extraordinary". 　These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a coronation. 　The Canadian Heraldic Authority has created the position of "Herald of Arms Emeritus" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists. 　In Scotland, some Scottish clan chiefs, the heads of great noble houses, still appoint private officers of arms to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants. 　In addition, many orders of chivalry have heralds attached to them. 　These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. 　Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. 　In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the Dutch monarch's inauguration where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.

A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a health facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. 　Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded. 　They typically cover the primary care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer more specialized treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays. 　Most commonly, the English word clinic refers to a general practice, run by one or more general practitioners offering small therapeutic treatments, but it can also mean a specialist clinic. 　Some clinics retain the name "clinic" even while growing into institutions as large as major hospitals or becoming associated with a hospital or medical school.

Stockholm (Swedish: [ˈstɔ̂kː(h)ɔlm] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Sweden as well as the largest urban area in Scandinavia. 　Approximately 980,000 people live in the municipality, with 1.6 million in the urban area, and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area. 　The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea. 　Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. 　The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. 　It is also the county seat of Stockholm County. 　For several hundred years, Stockholm was the capital of Finland as well (Finnish: Tukholma), which was then a part of Sweden. 　The population of the municipality of Stockholm is expected to reach one million people in 2024. 　Stockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden. 　The Stockholm region alone accounts for over a third of the country's GDP, and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per capita. 　Ranked as an alpha-global city, it is the largest in Scandinavia and the main centre for corporate headquarters in the Nordic region. 　The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm School of Economics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University. 　It hosts the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies and banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall. 　One of the city's most prized museums, the Vasa Museum, is the most visited non-art museum in Scandinavia. 　The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950, is well known for the decor of its stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world. 　Sweden's national football arena is located north of the city centre, in Solna. 　Avicii Arena, the national indoor arena, is in the southern part of the city. 　The city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics. 　Stockholm is the seat of the Swedish government and most of its agencies, including the highest courts in the judiciary, and the official residencies of the Swedish monarch and the Prime Minister. 　The government has its seat in the Rosenbad building, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) is seated in the Parliament House, and the Prime Minister's residence is adjacent at Sager House. 　Stockholm Palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the Swedish monarch, while Drottningholm Palace in neighboring Ekerö serves as the Royal Family's private residence.

A lease is a contractual arrangement calling for the user (referred to as the lessee) to pay the owner (referred to as the lessor) for the use of an asset. 　Property, buildings and vehicles are common assets that are leased. 　Industrial or business equipment are also leased. 　Basically a lease agreement is a contract between two parties: the lessor and the lessee. 　The lessor is the legal owner of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments. 　The lessee also agrees to abide by various conditions regarding their use of the property or equipment. 　For example, a person leasing a car may agree to the condition that the car will only be used for personal use. 　The term rental agreement can refer to two kinds of leases: A lease in which the asset is tangible property. 　Here, the user rents the asset (e.g. land or goods) let out or rented out by the owner (the verb to lease is less precise because it can refer to either of these actions). 　Examples of a lease for intangible property include use of a computer program (similar to a license, but with different provisions), or use of a radio frequency (such as a contract with a cell-phone provider). 　A periodic lease agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some regions of the United States.
