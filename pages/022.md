A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice. 　Religions which erect temples include Christianity (whose temples are typically called churches), Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism (whose temples are called gurudwara), Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), Islam (whose temples are called mosques), Judaism (whose temples are called synagogues), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called Agiary), the Baha'i Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baha'i House of Worship), Taoism (which are sometimes called Daoguan), Shinto (which are sometimes called Jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion. 　The form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be, in some sense, the "house" of one or more deities. 　Typically, offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. 　The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts, or even the whole main building. 　can only be accessed by the clergy. 　Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like an igloo. 　The word comes from Ancient Rome, where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. 　It has the same root as the word "template," a plan in preparation for the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur.

<font size=3>
A medal or medallion is a small portable artistic object, a thin disc, normally of metal, carrying a design, usually on both sides. 　They typically have a commemorative purpose of some kind, and many are presented as awards. 　They may be intended to be worn, suspended from clothing or jewellery in some way, although this has not always been the case. 　They may be struck like a coin by dies or die-cast in a mould. 　A medal may be awarded to a person or organisation as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, cultural, academic, or various other achievements. 　Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. 　Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. 　In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. 　An artist who creates medals or medallions is called a "medalist". 　Medals have long been popular collectible items, and in numismatics form a class called either exonumia or militaria. 　In the proper use of the term, medallions are larger, starting at perhaps four inches across, and are, as such, usually too large to be worn very comfortably, though in colloquial use, "medallion" is often used to refer to a medal used as the pendant of a necklace (as in the medallion man fashion style of the 1960s and 1970s), or for other types of medals. 　Medallions may also be called "table medals" because they are too large to be worn and can only be displayed on a wall, table top, desk, or cabinet.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle>Castle</a> 
<font size=3>
A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. 　Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. 　This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. 　Use of the term has varied over time and has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. 　Over the approximately 900 years when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace. 　European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. 　These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies. 　Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. 　Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source. 　Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. 　Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. 　In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. 　This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. 　Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower. 　These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. 　Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. 　Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape. 　Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. 　While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. 　As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. 　From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.

<font size=3>
The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life forms. 　Every cell consists of a cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, and contains many biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites. 　The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'. 　Cells can acquire specified function and carry out various tasks within the cell such as replication, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and motility. 　Cells are capable of specialization and mobility within the cell. 　Most cells are measured in micrometers due to their small size. 　Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres. 　Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure. 　Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). 　Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms. 　The number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species; it has been approximated that the human body contains an estimated 37 trillion (3.72×1013) cells. 　The brain accounts for around 80 billion of these cells. 　The study of cells and how they work has led to many other studies in related areas of biology, including: discovery of DNA, cancer systems biology, aging and developmental biology. 　Cell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. 　Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. 　Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.

Meaning is an epistemological concept used in multiple disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, linguistics, semiotics, and sociology, with its definition depending upon the field of study by which it is being used. 　These multidisciplinary uses of the term are not independent and can more or less overlap; each construction of the term meaning can correspond with related constructions in other fields. 　The logical positivists, for example, associated meaning with scientific verification.

<font size=3>
Genus (/ˈdʒiːnəs/ plural genera /ˈdʒɛnərə/) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. 　In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. 　In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. 　E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. 　Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae. 　The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. 　The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. 　There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful: monophyly – all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together (i.e. phylogenetic analysis should clearly demonstrate both monophyly and validity as a separate lineage). 　reasonable compactness – a genus should not be expanded needlessly. 　distinctness – with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria, i.e. ecology, morphology, or biogeography; DNA sequences are a consequence rather than a condition of diverging evolutionary lineages except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g. postzygotic barriers). 　Moreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera.

<font size=3>
An attempt to commit a crime occurs if a criminal has an intent to commit a crime and takes a substantial step toward completing the crime, but for reasons not intended by the criminal, the final resulting crime does not occur. 　Attempt to commit a particular crime is a crime, usually considered to be of the same or lesser gravity as the particular crime attempted.　: 669–671  Attempt is a type of inchoate crime, a crime that is not fully developed. 　The crime of attempt has two elements, intent and some conduct toward completion of the crime. 　One group of theories in criminal law is that attempt to commit an act occurs when a person comes dangerously close to carrying out a criminal act, and intends to commit the act, but does not commit it. 　The person may have carried out all the necessary steps (or thought they had) but still failed, or the attempt may have been abandoned or prevented at a late stage. 　The attempt must have gone beyond mere planning or preparation, and is distinct from other inchoate offenses such as conspiracy to commit a crime or solicitation of a crime. 　There are many specific crimes of attempt, such as attempted murder, which may vary by jurisdiction. 　Punishment is often less severe than would be the case if the attempted crime had been carried out. 　Abandonment of the attempt may constitute a not guilty defence, depending partly on the extent to which the attempt was abandoned freely and voluntarily. 　Early common law did not punish attempts; the law of attempt was not recognised by common law until the case of b. 　Rex v. Scofield in 1784.: 669  The essence of the crime of attempt in legal terms is that the defendant has failed to commit the actus reus (the Latin term for the "guilty act") of the full offense, but has the direct and specific intent to commit that full offense. 　The normal rule for establishing criminal liability is to prove an actus reus accompanied by a mens rea ("guilty mind") at the relevant time (see concurrence and strict liability offenses as the exception to the rule).

Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. 　In everyday language, truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences. 　Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsehood. 　The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. 　Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. 　Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. 　Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. 　This is called the correspondence theory of truth. 　Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. 　There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates, such as: the question of defining truth. 　If it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth. 　Identifying things are truth-bearers and are therefore capable of being true or false. 　If truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if there are other truth values. 　Identifying the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood. 　The role that truth plays in constituting knowledge. 　And if truth is always absolute, or if it can be relative to one's perspective.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain>Pain</a> 
<font size=3>
Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. 　The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage." 　In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. 　Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. 　Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. 　Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. 　Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. 　It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. 　Simple pain medications are useful in 20% to 70% of cases. 　Psychological factors such as social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, excitement, or distraction can affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. 　In some debates regarding physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, pain has been used as an argument to permit people who are terminally ill to end their lives.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine>Machine</a> 
<font size=3>
A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action. 　The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines. 　Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. 　They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. 　Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage. 　Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. 　Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory>Victory</a> 
<font size=3>
The term victory (from Latin victoria) originally applied to warfare, and denotes success achieved in personal combat, after military operations in general or, by extension, in any competition. 　Success in a military campaign constitutes a strategic victory, while the success in a military engagement is a tactical victory. 　In terms of human emotion, victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in human behaviour often exhibits movements and poses paralleling threat display preceding the combat, which are associated with the excess endorphin built up preceding and during combat. 　Victory dances and victory cries similarly parallel war dances and war cries performed before the outbreak of physical violence.　[citation needed] Examples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term victoria originated, include: the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus); and also the "abominable song" to Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579.[citation needed] The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn. 　The Roman Republic and Empire celebrated victories with triumph ceremonies and with monuments such as victory columns (e.g. Trajan's Column) and arches. 　A trophy is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (spolia), or body parts (as in the case of head hunters). 　Mythology often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek Nike or the Roman Victoria. 　The victorious agent is a hero, often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a monster (as Saint George slaying the dragon, Indra slaying Ahi, Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent etc.). 　Sol Invictus ("the Invincible Sun") of Roman mythology became an epithet of Christ in Christianity. 　Paul of Tarsus presents the resurrection of Christ as a victory over Death and Sin (1 Corinthians 15:55). 　The Latinate English-language word victory (from the 14th century) replaced the Old English equivalent term sige (cognate with Gothic sigis, Old High German sigu and Sieg in modern German), a frequent element in Germanic names (as in Sigibert, Sigurd etc.), cognate to Celtic sego and Sanskrit sahas.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry. 　In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed. 　Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role. 　Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoir, letters, and essays. 　Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other printed information on a particular subject. 　Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura/litteraturacode: lat promoted to code: la "learning, a writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from litera/litteracode: lat promoted to code: la "letter". 　In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. 　Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature. 　Literature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are often further categorized according to historical period, adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 23°N 102°W﻿ / ﻿23°N 102°W﻿ / 23; -102 Mexico (Spanish: México), officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. 　It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. 　Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi), making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with approximately 126,014,024 inhabitants, it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. 　Mexico is organized as a federal republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital. 　Other major urban areas include Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León. 　Human presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico goes back to 8,000 BCE and it went to become one of the world's six cradles of civilization. 　In particular, the Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. 　Last were the Aztecs, who dominated the region in the century before European contact. 　In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of New Spain. 　Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church played an important role expanding the territory, enforcing Christianity and spreading the Spanish language throughout. 　With the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain soon became one of the most important mining centers worldwide. 　Wealth coming from Asia and the New World contributed to Spain's status as a major world power for the next centuries, and brought about a price revolution in Western Europe. 　The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the War of Independence against Spain. 　Mexico's early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs. 　The Federal Republic of Central America shortly seceded the country. 　Then two invasions by foreign powers took place: first, by the United States as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers, which led to the Mexican–American War and huge territorial losses in 1848. 　After the introduction of liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with the war of Reform and prompted France to invade the country and install an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal President Benito Juárez, which emerged victorious. 　The last decades of the 19th century were dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order. 　However, the Porfiriato era led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican Revolution (civil war). 　This conflict led to profound changes in Mexican society, including the proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. 　The remaining war generals ruled as a succession of presidents until the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) emerged in 1929. 　The PRI governed Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic developmental policies of considerable economic success. 　During World War II Mexico also played an important role for the Allied war effort. 　Nonetheless, the PRI regime resorted to repression and electoral fraud to maintain power, and moved the country to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic policy during the late 20th century. 　This culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which caused a major indigenous rebellion in the state of Chiapas. 　PRI lost the presidency for the first time in 2000, against the conservative party (PAN). 　Mexico has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest economic partner. 　As a newly industrialized and developing country ranking 86th, high in the Human Development Index, its large economy and population, cultural influence, and steady democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power which is also identified as an emerging power by several analysts. 　Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity. 　Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals. 　However, the country continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and extensive crime. 　It ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index, due in large part to ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates, which violently compete for the US drug market and trade routes. 　This "drug war" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006. 　Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine>Engine</a> 
<font size=3>
An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy. 　Available energy sources include potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth's gravitational field as exploited in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g. geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and nuclear energy (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). 　Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form, so heat engines have special importance. 　Some natural processes, such as atmospheric convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the form of rising air currents). 　Mechanical energy is of particular importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing. 　Mechanical heat engines convert heat into work via various thermodynamic processes. 　The internal combustion engine is perhaps the most common example of a mechanical heat engine, in which heat from the combustion of a fuel causes rapid pressurisation of the gaseous combustion products in the combustion chamber, causing them to expand and drive a piston, which turns a crankshaft. 　Unlike internal combustion engines, a reaction engine (such as a jet engine) produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, in accordance with Newton's third law of motion. 　Apart from heat engines, electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air, and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. 　In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and ultimately motion (a chemical engine, but not a heat engine). 　Chemical heat engines which employ air (ambient atmospheric gas) as a part of the fuel reaction are regarded as airbreathing engines. 　Chemical heat engines designed to operate outside of Earth's atmosphere (e.g. rockets, deeply submerged submarines) need to carry an additional fuel component called the oxidizer (although there exist super-oxidizers suitable for use in rockets, such as fluorine, a more powerful oxidant than oxygen itself); or the application needs to obtain heat by non-chemical means, such as by means of nuclear reactions.

<font size=3>
The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. 　The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. 　The shoulder joint, also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. 　In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, and the head sits in the glenoid cavity. 　The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint. 　The shoulder joint is the main joint of the shoulder. 　It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. 　The joint capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. 　It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. 　The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint and contribute to the shoulder's stability. 　The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. 　The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head. 　The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing, and pulling.
