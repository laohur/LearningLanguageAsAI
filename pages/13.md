<font size=3>
Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that use polymers as a main ingredient. 　Their plasticity makes it possible for plastics to be moulded, extruded or pressed into solid objects of various shapes. 　This adaptability, plus a wide range of other properties, such as being lightweight, durable, flexible, and inexpensive to produce, has led to its widespread use. 　Plastics typically are made through human industrial systems. 　Most modern plastics are derived from fossil fuel-based chemicals like natural gas or petroleum; however, recent industrial methods use variants made from renewable materials, such as corn or cotton derivatives. 　9.2 billion tonnes of plastic are estimated to have been made between 1950 and 2017. 　More than half this plastic has been produced since 2004. 　In 2020, 400 million tonnes of plastic were produced. 　If global trends on plastic demand continue, it is estimated that by 2050 annual global plastic production will reach over 1,100 million tonnes. 　The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century has caused widespread environmental problems, due to their slow decomposition rate in natural ecosystems. 　Most plastic produced has not been reused, either being captured in landfills or persisting in the environment as plastic pollution. 　Plastic pollution can be found in all the world's major water bodies, for example, creating garbage patches in all of the world's oceans and contaminating terrestrial ecosystems. 　Of all the plastic discarded so far, some 14% has been incinerated and less than 10% has been recycled. 　In developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing or vinyl siding. 　Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic), furniture, and toys. 　In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ; 42% of India's consumption is used in packaging. 　In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic. 　Worldwide, about 50 kg of plastic is produced annually per person, with production doubling every ten years. 　The world's first fully synthetic plastic was Bakelite, invented in New York in 1907, by Leo Baekeland, who coined the term "plastics". 　Dozens of different types of plastics are produced today, such as polyethylene, which is widely used in product packaging, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used in construction and pipes because of its strength and durability. 　Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger, who has been called "the father of polymer chemistry" and Herman Mark, known as "the father of polymer physics".

<font size=3>
Look up legend in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived, both by teller and listeners, to have taken place in human history. 　Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. 　Legend, for its active and passive participants may include miracles. 　Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital. 　Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. 　Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters rather than gods, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not. 　The Brothers Grimm defined legend as "folktale historically grounded". 　A by-product of the "concern with human beings" is the long list of legendary creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends are "historically grounded." 　A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990: Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.

<font size=3>
Seattle (/siˈætəl/ (listen) see-AT-əl) is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. 　It is the seat of King County, Washington. 　With a 2020 population of 737,015, it is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. 　The Seattle metropolitan area's population is 4.02 million, making it the 15th-largest in the United States. 　Its growth rate of 21.1% between 2010 and 2020 makes it one of the nation's fastest-growing large cities. 　Seattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington. 　It is the northernmost major city in the United States, located about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canadian border. 　A major gateway for trade with East Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2021[update]. 　The Seattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. 　Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. 　The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named "Seattle" in 1852, in honor of Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. 　Today, Seattle has high populations of Native, Scandinavian, European American, Asian American and African American people, as well as a thriving LGBT community that ranks sixth in the United States by population. 　Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. 　Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. 　The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite by birth. 　Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international airport, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. 　The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. 　Seattle also has a significant musical history. 　Between 1918 and 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. 　The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson, and others. 　Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix, as well as the origin of the bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Heart, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters, and the alternative rock movement grunge.

<font size=3>
Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. 　Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. 　Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. 　The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. 　The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. 　When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. 　The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. 　If the charge moves, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. 　Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts. 　Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for: Electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment; Electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. 　Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 　The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. 　The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. 　Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. 　Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.

A grave is a location where a dead body (typically that of a human, although sometimes that of an animal) is buried or interred after a funeral. 　Graves are usually located in special areas set aside for the purpose of burial, such as graveyards or cemeteries. 　Certain details of a grave, such as the state of the body found within it and any objects found with the body, may provide information for archaeologists about how the body may have lived before its death, including the time period in which it lived and the culture that it had been a part of. 　In some religions, it is believed that the body must be burned or cremated for the soul to survive; in others, the complete decomposition of the body is considered to be important for the rest of the soul (see bereavement).

<font size=3>
In biology, an organ is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function. 　In the hierarchy of life, an organ lies between tissue and an organ system. 　Tissues are formed from same type cells to act together in a function. 　Tissues of different types combine to form an organ which has a specific function. 　The intestinal wall for example is formed by epithelial tissue and smooth muscle tissue. 　Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. 　An organ's tissues can be broadly categorized as parenchyma, the functional tissue, and stroma, the structural tissue with supportive, connective, or ancillary functions. 　For example, the gland's tissue that makes the hormones is the parenchyma, whereas the stroma includes the nerves that innervate the parenchyma, the blood vessels that oxygenate and nourish it and carry away its metabolic wastes, and the connective tissues that provide a suitable place for it to be situated and anchored. 　The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have common embryologic origins, such as arising from the same germ layer. 　Organs exist in most multicellular organisms. 　In single-celled organisms such as bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is known as an organelle. 　In plants, there are three main organs. 　In the study of anatomy, viscera (singular viscus) refers to the internal organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic cavities. 　The abdominal organs may be classified as solid organs, or hollow organs. 　The solid organs are the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands. 　The hollow organs of the abdomen are the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, bladder, and rectum. 　In the thoracic cavity the heart is a hollow, muscular organ. 　The number of organs in any organism depends on the definition used. 　By one widely adopted definition, 79 organs have been identified in the human body.

Rotation, or spin, is the circular movement of an object around a central axis. 　A two-dimensional rotating object has only one possible central axis and can rotate in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. 　A three-dimensional object has an infinite number of possible central axes and rotational directions. 　If the rotation axis passes internally through the body's own center of mass, then the body is said to be autorotating or spinning, and the surface intersection of the axis can be called a pole. 　A rotation around a completely external axis, e.g. the planet Earth around the Sun, is called revolving or orbiting, typically when it is produced by gravity, and the ends of the rotation axis can be called the orbital poles.

Jacob (/ˈdʒeɪkəb/; Hebrew: יַעֲקֹב‎, Modern: Yaʿaqōv (help·info), Tiberian: Yaʿăqōḇ; Arabic: يَعْقُوب, romanized: Yaʿqūb; Greek: Ἰακώβ, romanized: Iakṓb), later given the name Israel, is regarded as a patriarch of the Israelites and is an important figure in Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 　Jacob first appears in the Book of Genesis, where he is described as the son of Isaac and Rebecca, and the grandson of Abraham, Sarah, and Bethuel. 　According to the biblical account, he was the second-born of Isaac's children, the elder being Jacob's fraternal twin brother, Esau. 　Jacob is said to have bought Esau's birthright and, with his mother's help, deceived his aging father to bless him instead of Esau. 　Later in the narrative, following a severe drought in his homeland of Canaan, Jacob and his descendants, with the help of his son Joseph (who had become a confidant of the pharaoh), moved to Egypt where Jacob died at the age of 147. 　He is supposed to have been buried in the Cave of Machpelah. 　Jacob had twelve sons through four women, his wives, Leah and Rachel, and his concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah, who were, in order of their birth, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin, all of whom became the heads of their own family groups, later known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel. 　He also had a daughter named Dinah. 　According to Genesis, Jacob displayed favoritism among his wives and children, preferring Rachel and her sons, Joseph and Benjamin, causing tension within the family—culminating in Joseph's older brothers selling him into slavery. 　Scholars have taken a mixed view as to Jacob's historicity, with archaeology so far producing no evidence for his existence.

A bathroom or washroom is a room, typically in a home or other residential building, that contains either a bathtub or a shower (or both). 　The inclusion of a wash basin is common. 　In some parts of the world e.g. India, a toilet is typically included in the bathroom; in others, the toilet is typically given a dedicated room separate from the one allocated for personal hygiene activities. 　In North American English the word 'bathroom' is sometimes used to refer to any room in a residence that contains a toilet, regardless of the inclusion of a bath or shower. 　Historically, bathing was often a collective activity, which took place in public baths. 　In some countries the shared social aspect of cleansing the body is still important, as for example with sento in Japan and the "Turkish bath" (also known by other names) throughout the Islamic world.

<font size=3>
Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. 　A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity. 　Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. 　Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. 　The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. 　Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. 　This way they save time and the cost of traveling. 　A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods. 　Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. 　They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.

<font size=3>
Snapped is an American true crime television series produced by Jupiter Entertainment. 　The series depicts high profile or bizarre cases of women accused of murder. 　Each episode outlines the motivation for murder, whether it be revenge against a cheating husband or lover, a large insurance payoff, or the ending to years of abuse, with each murder's circumstances as unique as the women profiled. 　Snapped premiered on August 6, 2004 on Oxygen. 　It has since become the network's longest-running original series, with its 28 defined seasons and sixteen years in production (and two spin-offs) outlasting the seventeen seasons and thirteen years of the Bad Girls Club. 　The show also played a large role in the decision by parent company NBCUniversal to relaunch Oxygen as a crime network in 2017. 　As of November 22, 2020[update], 500 original episodes of Snapped have aired.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues>Blues</a> 

<font size=3>
Blues is a music genre and musical form which originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1860s. 　Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads from the African-American culture. 　The blues form is ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale, and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. 　Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. 　Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. 　Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. 　Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. 　It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. 　Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans. 　Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the music of Africa. 　The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the spirituals. 　The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and, later, the development of juke joints. 　It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. 　Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. 　The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. 　Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. 　Blues subgenres include country blues, such as Delta blues and Piedmont blues, as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago blues and West Coast blues. 　World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. 　In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock developed, which blended blues styles with rock music.

<font size=3>
An atmosphere (from Ancient Greek ἀτμός (atmós) 'vapour, steam', and σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'sphere') is a layer of gas or layers of gases that envelop a planet, and is held in place by the gravity of the planetary body. 　A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. 　A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules. 　The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and trace gases. 　Most organisms use oxygen for respiration; lightning and bacteria perform nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia that is used to make nucleotides and amino acids; plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. 　The layered composition of the atmosphere minimises the harmful effects of sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, the solar wind, and cosmic rays to protect organisms from genetic damage. 　The current composition of the atmosphere of the Earth is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms. 　Evolution of the Atmosphere

<font size=3>
In celestial mechanics, an orbit is the curved trajectory of an object such as the trajectory of a planet around a star, or of a natural satellite around a planet, or of an artificial satellite around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. 　Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. 　To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. 　For most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. 　However, Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics, provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection>Intersection</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, the intersection of two or more objects is another object consisting of everything that is contained in all of the objects simultaneously. 　For example, in Euclidean geometry, when two lines in a plane are not parallel, their intersection is the point at which they meet. 　More generally, in set theory, the intersection of sets is defined to be the set of elements which belong to all of them. 　Unlike the Euclidean definition, this does not presume that the objects under consideration lie in a common space. 　Intersection is one of the basic concepts of geometry. 　An intersection can have various geometric shapes, but a point is the most common in a plane geometry. 　Incidence geometry defines an intersection (usually, of flats) as an object of lower dimension that is incident to each of original objects. 　In this approach an intersection can be sometimes undefined, such as for parallel lines. 　In both cases the concept of intersection relies on logical conjunction. 　Algebraic geometry defines intersections in its own way with intersection theory.

<font size=3>
Vienna (/viˈɛnə/ (listen) vee-EN-ə; German: Wien [viːn] (listen); Austro-Bavarian: Wean [veɐ̯n]) is the capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria. 　Vienna is Austria's most populous city and its primate city, with about two million inhabitants (2.9 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political center. 　It is the 5th-largest city proper by population in the European Union and the largest of all cities on the Danube river. 　Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had two million inhabitants. 　Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin. 　Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. 　The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 　These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. 　Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. 　In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger. 　Additionally, Vienna is known as the "City of Music" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home. 　Vienna is also said to be the "City of Dreams" because it was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud. 　Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city. 　It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. 　The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks. 　Vienna is known for its high quality of life. 　In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most livable cities. 　Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne. 　Monocle's 2015 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within". 　Monocle's 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010). 　The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most prosperous city in the world in 2012–2013. 　The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets. 　Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners. 　Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions. 　It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.

<font size=3>
Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of a thing, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. 　Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression. 　To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves. 　Some sources describe abuse as "socially constructed", which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome>Welcome</a> 

<font size=3>
A welcome is a kind of greeting designed to introduce a person to a new place or situation, and to make them feel at ease. 　The term can similarly be used to describe the feeling of being accepted on the part of the new person. 　In some contexts, a welcome is extended to a stranger to an area or a household. 　"The concept of welcoming the stranger means intentionally building into the interaction those factors that make others feel that they belong, that they matter, and that you want to get to know them". 　It is also noted, however, that "[i]n many community settings, being welcoming is viewed as in conflict with ensuring safety. Thus, welcoming becomes somewhat self-limited: 'We will be welcoming unless you do something unsafe'". 　Different cultures have their own traditional forms of welcome, and a variety of different practices can go into an effort to welcome: Making a welcome is not a physical fabrication, though welcome may be embodied and fostered by appropriate physical arrangements. 　There can be an aesthetics of welcome. 　What is there when one makes a welcome? 　No thing really, and yet more than any thing. 　When one makes a welcome one creates the conditions that promise of home. 　One makes it possible for the other not any longer to feel outside or out of it, but to feel at home. 　Indications that visitors are welcome can occur at different levels. 　For example, a welcome sign, at the national, state, or municipal level, is a road sign at the border of a region that introduces or welcomes visitors to the region. 　A welcome sign might also be present for a specific community, or an individual building. 　One architect suggests that "[a] primary distinction between a gateway and a Welcome sign is that the gateway is usually designed and built by an outsider, a developer or architect, while the Welcome sign has been designed and built by an inside member of the community". 　A welcome mat is a doormat that welcomes visitors to a house or other building by providing them with a place to wipe their feet before entering. 　Another community tradition, the welcome wagon, a phrase that originally referred to an actual wagon containing a collection of useful gifts collected from residents of an area to welcome new people moving to that area.

<font size=3>
An expert is somebody who has a broad and deep understanding and competence in terms of knowledge, skill and experience through practice and education in a particular field. 　Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. 　An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. 　Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. 　An expert can be believed, by virtue of credentials, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion on that topic. 　Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage. 　The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. 　In specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic qualification for them to be accepted as an expert. 　In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. 　Another example from computer science is that an expert system may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. 　In law, an expert witness must be recognized by argument and authority. 　Research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. 　Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. 　The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. 　Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.

<font size=3>
Malaysia (/məˈleɪziə, -ʒə/ (listen) mə-LAY-zee-ə, -⁠zhə; Malay: [məlejsiə]) is a country in Southeast Asia. 　The federal constitutional monarchy consists of thirteen states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo's East Malaysia. 　Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. 　East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia, and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. 　Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, the country's largest city, and the seat of the legislative branch of the federal government. 　The nearby planned capital of Putrajaya is the administrative capital, which represents the seat of both the executive branch (the Cabinet, federal ministries, and agencies) and the judicial branch of the federal government. 　With a population of over 32 million, Malaysia is the world's 45th-most populous country. 　The southernmost point of continental Eurasia is in Tanjung Piai. 　Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to numerous endemic species. 　Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms, which, from the 18th century on, became subject to the British Empire, along with the British Straits Settlements protectorate. 　During World War Two, British Malaya, along with other nearby British and American colonies, was occupied by the Empire of Japan. 　Following three years of occupation, peninsular Malaysia was unified as the Malayan Union in 1946 and then restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948. 　The country achieved independence on 31 August 1957. 　The independent Malaya united with the then British crown colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. 　In August 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation and became a separate independent country. 　The country is multiethnic and multicultural, which has a significant effect on its politics. 　About half the population is ethnically Malay, with minorities of Chinese, Indians, and indigenous peoples. 　The country's official language is Malaysian Malay, a standard form of the Malay language. 　English remains an active second language. 　While recognising Islam as the country's established religion, the constitution grants freedom of religion to non-Muslims. 　The government is modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, and the legal system is based on common law. 　The head of state is an elected monarch, chosen from among the nine state sultans every five years. 　The head of government is the Prime Minister. 　After independence, the Malaysian GDP grew at an average rate of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years. 　The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources but is expanding in the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and medical tourism. 　Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked third-largest in Southeast Asia and 36th-largest in the world. 　It is a founding member of ASEAN, EAS, and OIC and a member of APEC, the Commonwealth, and the Non-Aligned Movement.

<font size=3>
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions. 　This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word weal, which is from an Indo-European word stem. 　The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. 　An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy. 　Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts). 　At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "the total of anything of value" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. 　Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts. 　Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own. 　A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy. 　The United Nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets. 　Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals. 　Human capital is the population's education and skills. 　Physical (or "manufactured") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit>Summit</a> 

<font size=3>
A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. 　The topographic terms acme, apex, peak (mountain peak), and zenith are synonymous. 　The term top (mountain top) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. 　For example, a big, massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. 　Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered subsummits (or subpeaks) of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. 　A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top. 　Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route. 　The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) above sea level. 　The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. 　They reached the mountain's peak in 1953. 　Whether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. 　The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres (98 ft) or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres (980 ft). 　Otherwise, it's a subpeak. 　In many parts of the Western United States, the term summit can also be used for the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad, more commonly referred to as a pass. 　For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit. 　This can lead to confusion as to whether a labeled "summit" is a pass or a peak.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser>Laser</a> 

<font size=3>
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. 　The term is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. 　The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. 　A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light that is coherent. 　Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. 　Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar (light detection and ranging). 　Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum. 　Alternatively, temporal coherence can be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond. 　Lasers are used in optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic, and free-space optical communication, semiconducting chip manufacturing (photolithography), laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment. 　Semiconductor lasers in the blue to near-UV have also been used in place of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to excite fluorescence as a white light source. 　This permits a much smaller emitting area due to the much greater radiance of a laser and avoids the droop suffered by LEDs; such devices are already used in some car headlamps.

<font size=3>
Montreal (/ˌmʌntriˈɔːl/ (listen) MUN-tree-AWL; French: Montréal [mɔ̃ʁeal] (listen)) is the second most populous city in Canada and most populous city in the Canadian province of Quebec. 　Founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or "City of Mary", it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill around which the early city of Ville-Marie is built. 　The city is centred on the Island of Montreal, which obtained its name from the same origin as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. 　The city is 196 km (122 mi) east of the national capital Ottawa, and 258 km (160 mi) southwest of the provincial capital, Quebec City. 　As of 2021,[update] the city had a population of 1,762,949, and a metropolitan population of 4,291,732, making it the second-largest city, and second-largest metropolitan area in Canada. 　French is the city's official language. 　In 2021, it was spoken at home by 59.1% of the population and 69.2% in the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area. 　Overall, 85.7% of the population of the city of Montreal considered themselves fluent in French while 90.2% could speak it in the metropolitan area. 　Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada, with 58.5% of the population able to speak both English and French. 　Historically the commercial capital of Canada, Montreal was surpassed in population and in economic strength by Toronto in the 1970s. 　It remains an important centre of commerce, aerospace, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, education, art, culture, tourism, food, fashion, video game development, film, and world affairs. 　Montreal is the location of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and was named a UNESCO City of Design in 2006. 　In 2017, Montreal was ranked the 12th-most liveable city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit in its annual Global Liveability Ranking, although it slipped to rank 40 in the 2021 index, primarily due to stress on the healthcare system from the COVID-19 pandemic. 　It is regularly ranked as a top ten city in the world to be a university student in the QS World University Rankings. 　Montreal has hosted multiple international conferences and events, including the 1967 International and Universal Exposition and the 1976 Summer Olympics. 　It is the only Canadian city to have held the Summer Olympics. 　In 2018, Montreal was ranked as a global city. 　The city hosts the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One; the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the largest jazz festival in the world; the Just for Laughs festival, the largest comedy festival in the world; and Les Francos de Montréal, the largest French-language music festival in the world. 　It is also home to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, who have won the Stanley Cup more times than any other team.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy>Fantasy</a> 

<font size=3>
Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction involving magical elements, typically set in a fictional universe and sometimes inspired by mythology and folklore. 　Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became fantasy literature and drama. 　From the twentieth century, it has expanded further into various media, including film, television, graphic novels, manga, animations and video games. 　Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the respective absence of scientific or macabre themes, although these genres overlap. 　In popular culture, the fantasy genre predominantly features settings that emulate Earth, but with a sense of otherness. 　In its broadest sense, however, fantasy consists of works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield>Shield</a> 

<font size=3>
A shield is a piece of personal armour held in the hand, which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. 　Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, whether from close-ranged weaponry or projectiles such as arrows, by means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat. 　Shields vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from large panels that protect the user's whole body to small models (such as the buckler) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use. 　Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of spears and crossbow bolts, others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes (like the roromaraugi or qauata). 　Finally, shields vary greatly in shape, ranging in roundness to angularity, proportional length and width, symmetry and edge pattern; different shapes provide more optimal protection for infantry or cavalry, enhance portability, provide secondary uses such as ship protection or as a weapon and so on. 　In prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilisations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or wicker. 　In classical antiquity, the Barbarian Invasions and the Middle Ages, they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. 　They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry. 　Depending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial or scalloped. 　Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eye-hole, to look through when used with combat. 　The shield was held by a central grip or by straps with some going over or around the user's arm and one or more being held by the hand. 　Often shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. 　These designs developed into systematized heraldic devices during the High Middle Ages for purposes of battlefield identification. 　Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. 　In the 18th century, for example, Scottish Highland fighters liked to wield small shields known as targes, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as Zulu warriors) employed them when waging war. 　In the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta>Atlanta</a> 

<font size=3>
Atlanta (/ætˈlæntə/ at-LAN-tə) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Georgia. 　It is the seat of Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, although a portion of the city extends into neighboring DeKalb county. 　With a population of 498,715 living within the city limits, it is the eighth most populous city in the Southeast and 38th most populous city in the United States according to the 2020 U.S. census. 　It is the core of the much larger Atlanta metropolitan area, which is home to more than 6.1 million people, making it the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. 　Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, it features unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the most dense urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States. 　Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth. 　The largest was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name "Atlanta" is derived, signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of transportation. 　During the American Civil War, it served a strategically important role for the Confederacy until it was captured in 1864. 　The city was almost entirely burnt to the ground during General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. 　However, the city rebounded dramatically in the post-war period and quickly became a national industrial center and the unofficial capital of the "New South". 　After World War II, it also became a manufacturing and technology hub. 　During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals becoming prominent figures in the movement's leadership. 　In the modern era, Atlanta has stayed true to its reputation as a major center of transportation, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998 (a position it has held every year since, with the exception of 2020 as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). 　With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $406 billion, Atlanta has the tenth largest economy of cities in the U.S. and the 20th largest in the world. 　Its economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors in industries including transportation, aerospace, logistics, healthcare, news and media operations, film and television production, information technology, finance, and biomedical research and public policy. 　The gentrification of some its neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline. 　This has altered its demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.

Donald is a masculine given name derived from the Gaelic name Dòmhnall. 　This comes from the Proto-Celtic *Dumno-ualos ("world-ruler" or "world-wielder"). 　The final -d in Donald is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers, and partly associated with the spelling of similar-sounding Germanic names, such as Ronald. 　A short form of Donald is Don. 　Pet forms of Donald include Donnie and Donny. 　The feminine given name Donella is derived from Donald. 　Donald has cognates in other Celtic languages: Modern Irish Dónal (anglicised as Donal and Donall); Scottish Gaelic Dòmhnall, Domhnull and Dòmhnull; Welsh Dyfnwal and Cumbric Dumnagual. 　Although the feminine given name Donna is sometimes used as a feminine form of Donald, the names are not etymologically related.

In law, a witness is someone who has knowledge about a matter, whether they have sensed it or are testifying on another witnesses' behalf. 　In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what they know or claim to know. 　In law a witness might be compelled to provide testimony in court, before a grand jury, before an administrative tribunal, before a deposition officer, or in a variety of other legal proceedings. 　A subpoena is a legal document that commands a person to appear at a proceeding. 　It is used to compel the testimony of a witness in a trial. 　Usually, it can be issued by a judge or by the lawyer representing the plaintiff or the defendant in a civil trial or by the prosecutor or the defense attorney in a criminal proceeding, or by a government agency. 　In many jurisdictions, it is compulsory to comply with the subpoena and either take an oath or solemnly affirm to testify truthfully under penalty of perjury. 　Although informally a witness includes whoever perceived the event, in law, a witness is different from an informant. 　A confidential informant is someone who claimed to have witnessed an event or have hearsay information, but whose identity is being withheld from at least one party (typically the criminal defendant). 　The information from the confidential informant may have been used by a police officer or other official acting as a hearsay witness to obtain a search warrant.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride>Pride</a> 

<font size=3>
Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or "confidence and satisfaction in oneself". 　However, "pride" sometimes is used interchangeably with "conceit" or "arrogance" (among other words) with negative connotations. 　Oxford defines it as "the quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own importance." 　This may be related to one's own abilities or achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's country. 　Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of oneself", as opposed to false pride or narcissism. 　Similarly, St. Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence", and Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism manifests." 　Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others. 　Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status. 　Pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice, sometimes as proper or as a virtue. 　With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. 　With a negative connotation pride refers to a foolishly and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments, used synonymously with hubris. 　While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. 　In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. 　When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, the greatness of soul or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, vanity or vainglory. 　Other possible objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sexual identity (especially LGBT pride).　[citation needed]

An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). 　Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 　The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. 　Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. 　Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. 　Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. 　Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. 　Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. 　Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. 　There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. 　Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. 　Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. 　In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. 　Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)>Endemic (epidemiology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In epidemiology, an infection is said to be endemic in a specific population or populated place when that infection is constantly maintained at a baseline level without extra infections being brought into the group as a result of travel or similar means. 　An endemic disease always has a steady, predictable number of people getting sick, but that number can be high (hyperendemic) or low (hypoendemic), and the disease can be severe or mild. 　Also, a disease that is usually endemic can become epidemic. 　For example, chickenpox is endemic (steady state) in the United Kingdom, but malaria is not. 　Every year, there are a few cases of malaria reported in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable vector (mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles). 　Consequently, the number of people infected by malaria is too variable to be called endemic. 　However, the number of people who get chickenpox in the UK varies little from year to year, so chickenpox is considered endemic in the UK.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond>Diamond</a> 

<font size=3>
Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic. 　Another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form of carbon at room temperature and pressure, but diamond is metastable and converts to it at a negligible rate under those conditions. 　Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material, properties that are used in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. 　They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth. 　Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid, few types of impurity can contaminate it (two exceptions are boron and nitrogen). 　Small numbers of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange, or red. 　Diamond also has a very high refractive index and a relatively high optical dispersion. 　Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years. 　Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres (93 and 155 mi) in the Earth's mantle, although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres (500 mi). 　Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolved various minerals and replaced them with diamonds. 　Much more recently (hundreds to tens of million years ago), they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites. 　Synthetic diamonds can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from hydrocarbon gases by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 　Imitation diamonds can also be made out of materials such as cubic zirconia and silicon carbide. 　Natural, synthetic and imitation diamonds are most commonly distinguished using optical techniques or thermal conductivity measurements.

<font size=3>
Portugal (Portuguese pronunciation: [puɾtuˈɣal]), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa [ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ puɾtuˈɣezɐ]), is a country located on the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern Europe, and whose territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. 　It features the westernmost point in continental Europe, and its Iberian portion is bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain, the sole country to have a land border with Portugal. 　Its two archipelagos form two autonomous regions with their own regional governments. 　Lisbon is the capital and largest city by population. 　One of the oldest countries in Europe, its territory has been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. 　The territory was first inhabited by pre-Roman and Celtic peoples (at the time of the first large-scale Roman invasions in Western Iberia, they preponderantly were the Lusitanians, the Gallaecians, the Celtici and, to some extent, the Conii). 　These peoples had contact with Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Carthaginians. 　It was later ruled by the Romans, followed by the invasions of Germanic peoples (most prominently, the Suebi and the Visigoths) together with the Alans, and the Islamic invasion the Umayyad Caliphate, whose rule were eventually expelled during the Reconquista. 　Founded first as a county within the Kingdom of León in 868, the country officially gained its independence as the Kingdom of Portugal with the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. 　In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established one of the longest-lived maritime and commercial empires, becoming one of the main economic and political powers of the time. 　At the end of the 16th century, however, Portugal suffered a war for the crown succession which led to the incorporation of the country into the Spanish monarchy during the Iberian Union. 　By the early 19th century, the accumulative crisis, events such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the country's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the resulting independence of Brazil in 1822 led to a marked decay of Portugal's prior opulence. 　This was followed by the civil war between liberal constitutionalists and conservative absolutists over royal succession, which lasted from 1828 to 1834. 　The 1910 revolution deposed Portugal's centuries-old monarchy, and established the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic, later being superseded by the Estado Novo (New State) authoritarian regime. 　Democracy was restored after the Carnation Revolution (1974), ending the Portuguese Colonial War and eventually losing its remanent colonial possessions. 　Portugal has left a profound cultural, architectural and linguistic influence across the globe, with a legacy of around 250 million Portuguese speakers around the world. 　It is a developed country with an advanced economy which holds the 14th largest gold reserve at its national central bank, the 8th largest proven reserves of lithium, with the weight of exports representing 49% of its GDP in 2022 and high living standards. 　Additionally, it ranks highly in peacefulness, democracy, press freedom, stability, social progress, prosperity and English proficiency. 　A member of the United Nations, the European Union, the Schengen Area and the Council of Europe (CoE), Portugal was also one of the founding members of NATO, the eurozone, the OECD, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.

A parent is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species. 　In humans, a parent is the caretaker of a child (where "child" refers to offspring, not necessarily age). 　A biological parent is a person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum. 　Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. 　A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. 　Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child. 　Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members. 　A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. 　With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents. 　Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material. 　The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents. 　A mother is, "a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth." 　The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect, while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling>Ceiling</a> 

<font size=3>
A ceiling /ˈsiːlɪŋ/ is an overhead interior surface that covers the upper limits of a room. 　It is not generally considered a structural element, but a finished surface concealing the underside of the roof structure or the floor of a story above. 　Ceilings can be decorated to taste, and there are many fine examples of frescoes and artwork on ceilings especially in religious buildings. 　A ceiling can also be the upper limit of a tunnel. 　The most common type of ceiling is the dropped ceiling, which is suspended from structural elements above. 　Panels of drywall are fastened either directly to the ceiling joists or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists. 　Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. 　Alternatively, ceilings may be spray painted instead, leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted, and using spray foam. 　A subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling, wherein a network of aluminum struts, as opposed to drywall, are attached to the joists, forming a series of rectangular spaces. 　Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard, interspersed with aluminum rails, is seen as the ceiling from below. 　This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling, since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard, rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it. 　Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. 　Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. 　Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy>Democracy</a> 

<font size=3>
Democracy (From Ancient Greek: δημοκρατία, romanized: dēmokratía, dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule') is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation ("direct democracy"), or to choose governing officials to do so ("representative democracy"). 　Who is considered part of "the people" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries. 　Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, property rights, freedom of religion and speech, inclusiveness and equality, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights. 　The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably. 　Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. 　Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. 　Prevalent day-to-day decision making of democracies is the majority rule, though other decision making approaches like supermajority and consensus have also been integral to democracies. 　They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues—counterbalancing majoritarianism—and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level. 　In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority—usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech or freedom of association. 　The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean "rule of the people", in contrast to aristocracy (ἀριστοκρατία, aristokratía), meaning "rule of an elite". 　Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in antiquity, is generally considered to have originated in city-states such as those in Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. 　In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. 　In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 　Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in autocratic systems like absolute monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy—oppositions inherited from ancient Greek philosophy. 　Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 　World public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government. 　According to the V-Dem Institute and Economist Intelligence Unit democracy indices, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2021. 　Democratic backsliding with a rise in hybrid regimes has exceeded democratization since the early to mid 2010s.

In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). 　It is the largest joint in the human body. 　The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. 　The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis. 　It is often termed a compound joint having tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components. 　(The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool>Liverpool</a> 

<font size=3>
Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough in North West England. 　With a population of 486,100 in 2021, it is located within the county of Merseyside and is the principal city of the wider Liverpool City Region. 　Its metropolitan area is the fifth largest in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2.24 million. 　On the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, Liverpool historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the county of Lancashire. 　It became a borough in 1207, a city in 1880, and a county borough independent of the newly-created Lancashire County Council in 1889. 　Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. 　Along with general cargo, freight, and raw materials such as coal and cotton, merchants were involved in the slave trade. 　In the 19th century, Liverpool was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to North America. 　It was also home to both the Cunard and White Star Lines, and was the port of registry of the ocean liners RMS Titanic, RMS Lusitania, RMS Queen Mary, RMS Queen Elizabeth and RMS Olympic. 　In 2019, Liverpool was the fifth most visited UK city. 　It is noted for its culture, architecture, and transport links. 　The city is closely associated with the arts, especially music. 　The popularity of the Beatles, widely regarded as the most influential band of all time, led to it becoming a tourist destination. 　Liverpool has continued to be the home of numerous notable musicians and record labels—musicians from the city have released 56 No. 1 hit singles, more than any other city in the world. 　The city also has a long-standing reputation for producing countless actors and actresses, artists, athletes, comedians, journalists, novelists, and poets. 　Liverpool has the second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and listed parks in the UK; only the capital, London, has more. 　The former Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street. 　In sport, the city is best known as the home of Premier League football teams Liverpool FC and Everton FC, with matches between the two rivals being known as the Merseyside derby. 　The annual Grand National horse race takes place at Aintree Racecourse. 　Several areas of Liverpool city centre carried World Heritage Site status from 2004 until 2021; the city's vast collection of parks and open spaces has been described as the "most important in the country" by England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. 　Its status as a port city historically attracted a diverse population from a wide range of cultures, primarily Ireland, Norway, and Wales. 　It is also home to the oldest black community in the UK and the oldest Chinese community in Europe. 　Natives of Liverpool (and some longtime residents from elsewhere) are formally referred to as "Liverpudlians" but are usually called "Scousers" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city; "Scouse" is also the most common name for the Liverpool accent and dialect. 　The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 European Capital of Culture, which it shared with the Norwegian city of Stavanger. 　Its selection as a European Capital of Culture has been credited with kickstarting its economic renaissance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant>Merchant</a> 

<font size=3>
A merchant is a person who trades in commodities produced by other people, especially one who trades with foreign countries. 　Historically, a merchant is anyone who is involved in business or trade. 　Merchants have operated for as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed. 　In 16th-century Europe, two different terms for merchants emerged: meerseniers referred to local traders (such as bakers and grocers) and koopman (Dutch: koopman) referred to merchants who operated on a global stage, importing and exporting goods over vast distances and offering added-value services such as credit and finance. 　The status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies. 　In modern times, the term merchant has occasionally been used to refer to a businessperson or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue using a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth. 　Merchants have been known for as long as humans have engaged in trade and commerce. 　Merchants and merchant networks operated in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Phoenicia, and Rome. 　During the European medieval period, a rapid expansion in trade and commerce led to the rise of a wealthy and powerful merchant class. 　The European age of discovery opened up new trading routes and gave European consumers access to a much broader range of goods. 　From the 1600s, goods began to travel much further distances as they found their way into geographically dispersed market-places. 　Following the opening of Asia to European trade and the discovery of the New World, merchants imported goods over very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. 　By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant had started to emerge and modern business practices were becoming evident.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen>Dozen</a> 

<font size=3>
A dozen (commonly abbreviated doz or dz) is a grouping of twelve. 　The dozen may be one of the earliest primitive integer groupings, perhaps because there are approximately a dozen cycles of the Moon, or months, in a cycle of the Sun, or year. 　Twelve is convenient because it has a maximal number of divisors among the numbers up to its double, a property only true of 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 360, and 2520. 　The use of twelve as a base number, known as the duodecimal system (also as dozenal), originated in Mesopotamia (see also sexagesimal). 　Counting in base-12 can easily be accomplished on one's hands by counting each finger bone with one's thumb. 　Using this method, one hand can count to twelve, and two hands (with the second hand as a placeholder for representing units of twelve) can count to 144. 　Twelve dozen (122 = 144) are known as a gross; and twelve gross (123 = 1,728, the duodecimal 1,000) are called a great gross, a term most often used when shipping or buying items in bulk. 　A great hundred, also known as a small gross, is 120 or ten dozen. 　Dozen may also be used to express a moderately large quantity as in "several dozen" (e.g., dozens of people came to the party). 　Varying by country, some products are packaged or sold by the dozen, often foodstuff (a dozen eggs).

<font size=3>
Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. 　It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. 　Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. 　Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. 　Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose. 　As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. 　In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. 　India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, but it exports few other milk products. 　Because there is an ever-increasing demand for dairy products within India, it could eventually become a net importer of dairy products. 　New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. 　The US CDC recommends that children over the age of 12 months should have two servings of dairy milk products a day. 　More than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, and between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.

An archive is an accumulation of historical records or materials – in any medium – or the physical facility in which they are located. 　Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. 　Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. 　They have been metaphorically defined as "the secretions of an organism", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. 　In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. 　Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines of which many identical copies may exist. 　This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings. 　A person who works in archives is called an archivist. 　The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science. 　The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the United Kingdom), an archives (more usual in the United States), or a repository. 　The computing use of the term "archive" should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.

<font size=3>
Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. 　It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague. 　In some cultures, the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; in others, such as the U.S. and Canada, a person could have many friends, and perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called good friends or best friends. 　Other colloquial terms include besties or Best Friends Forever (BFFs). 　Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many such bonds. 　Such features include choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together, and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another. 　Sometimes friends are distinguished from family, as in the saying "friends and family", and sometimes from lovers (e.g., "lovers and friends"), although the line is blurred with friends with benefits. 　Similarly, the friend zone is a term for when someone is restricted from rising up to the status of lover, hence the name (see also Unrequited love). 　Friendship has been studied in academic fields, such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. 　Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.

<font size=3>
A scholarship is a form of financial aid awarded to students for further education. 　Generally, scholarships are awarded based on a set of criteria such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need. 　Scholarship criteria usually reflect the values and goals of the donor of the award, and while scholarship recipients are not required to repay scholarships, the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements during their period of support, such maintaining a minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity (e.g., playing on a school sports team for athletic scholarship holders). 　Scholarships also range in generosity; some range from covering partial tuition ranging all the way to a 'full-ride', covering all tuition, accommodation, housing and others. 　Some prestigious, highly competitive scholarships are well-known even outside the academic community, such as Fulbright Scholarship and the Rhodes Scholarships at the graduate level, and the Robertson, Morehead-Cain and Jefferson Scholarships at the undergraduate level.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography>Photography</a> 

<font size=3>
Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. 　It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. 　Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. 　With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. 　The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. 　A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

Baltimore (/ˈbɔːltɪmɔːr/ BAWL-tim-or, locally: /bɔːldəˈmɔːr/ bawl-da-MOR or /ˈbɔːlmər/ BAWL-mər) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland, the fourth most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic, and the 30th most populous city in the United States with a population of 585,708 in 2020. 　Baltimore was designated an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851, and today it is the most populous independent city in the nation. 　As of 2021, the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be 2,838,327, making it the nation's 20th largest metropolitan area. 　Baltimore is located about 40 miles (64 km) north northeast of Washington, D.C., making it a principal city in the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area (CSA), the third-largest CSA in the nation, with a 2021 estimated population of 9,946,526. 　Prior to European colonization, the Baltimore region was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannock Native Americans, who were primarily settled further northwest than where the city was later built. 　Colonists from the Province of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe, and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729. 　The first printing press and newspapers were introduced to Baltimore by Nicholas Hasselbach and William Goddard respectively, in the mid-18th century. 　The Battle of Baltimore was a pivotal engagement during the War of 1812, culminating in the failed British bombardment of Fort McHenry, during which Francis Scott Key wrote a poem that would become "The Star-Spangled Banner", which was eventually designated as the American national anthem in 1931. 　During the Pratt Street Riot of 1861, the city was the site of some of the earliest violence associated with the American Civil War. 　The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the oldest railroad in the United States, was built in 1830 and cemented Baltimore's status as a major transportation hub, giving producers in the Midwest and Appalachia access to the city's port. 　Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States. 　In addition, Baltimore was a major manufacturing center. 　After a decline in major manufacturing, heavy industry, and restructuring of the rail industry, Baltimore has shifted to a service-oriented economy. 　Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University are the city's top two employers. 　Baltimore and its surrounding region are home to the headquarters of a number of major organizations and government agencies, including the NAACP, ABET, the National Federation of the Blind, Catholic Relief Services, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, World Relief, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Social Security Administration. 　Baltimore is also home to the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball and the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. 　Many of Baltimore's neighborhoods have rich histories. 　The city is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation, including Fell's Point, Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. 　These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971, soon after historic preservation legislation was passed. 　Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country. 　Nearly one third of the city's buildings (over 65,000) are designated as historic in the National Register, which is more than any other U.S. city. 　Baltimore has 66 National Register Historic Districts and 33 local historic districts. 　The historical records of the government of Baltimore are located at the Baltimore City Archives.

<font size=3>
Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. 　Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. 　Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. 　Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. 　While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. 　Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and quality of life. 　However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. 　This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature. 　Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. 　Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. 　This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. 　Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment. 　Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth, and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event. 　According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.

<font size=3>
Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication. 　In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed towards a deity or a deified ancestor. 　More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of thanksgiving or praise, and in comparative religion is closely associated with more abstract forms of meditation and with charms or spells. 　Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set liturgy or ritual, and it can be performed alone or in groups. 　Prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. 　The act of prayer is attested in written sources as early as 5000 years ago. 　Today, most major religions involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time. 　Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. 　The efficacy of prayer in faith healing has been evaluated in numerous studies, with contradictory results.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower>Flower</a> 

<font size=3>
A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). 　The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. 　Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs. 　There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and cross-pollination. 　Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. 　Cross-pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. 　Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. 　This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. 　Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). 　Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. 　Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. 　After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. 　In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to the environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft, religion, holistic medicine, and as a source of food.

<font size=3>
An ion (/ˈaɪ.ɒn, -ən/) is an atom or molecule with a net electrical charge. 　The charge of an electron is considered to be negative by convention and this charge is equal and opposite to the charge of a proton, which is considered to be positive by convention. 　The net charge of an ion is not zero because its total number of electrons is unequal to its total number of protons. 　A cation is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons while an anion is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons. 　Opposite electric charges are pulled towards one another by electrostatic force, so cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds. 　Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions, while two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. 　In the case of physical ionization in a fluid (gas or liquid), "ion pairs" are created by spontaneous molecule collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion. 　Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a direct current through a conducting solution, dissolving an anode via ionization.

A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. 　It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. 　Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of their life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. 　Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. 　One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. 　Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the genre known as biography. 　An authorized biography is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. 　An autobiography is written by the person themselves, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or ghostwriter.

Cleveland (/ˈkliːvlənd/ KLEEV-lənd), officially the City of Cleveland, is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County. 　Located in the northeastern part of the state, it is situated along the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S. maritime border with Canada, 252 miles (406 km) northeast of Cincinnati, 143 miles (230 km) northeast of Columbus, and approximately 60 miles (97 km) west of Pennsylvania. 　The largest city on Lake Erie and one of the major cities of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland ranks as the 54th-largest city in the U.S. with a 2020 population of 372,624. 　The city anchors both the Greater Cleveland metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton combined statistical area (CSA). 　The CSA is the most populous in Ohio and the 17th-largest in the country, with a population of 3.63 million in 2020, while the MSA ranks as 34th-largest at 2.09 million. 　Cleveland was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River by General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city was named. 　Its location on both the river and the lake shore allowed it to grow into a major commercial and industrial center, attracting large numbers of immigrants and migrants. 　Cleveland is a port city, connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 　Its economy relies on diverse sectors that include higher education, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedicals. 　The GDP for the Greater Cleveland MSA was $135 billion in 2019. 　Combined with the Akron MSA, the seven-county Cleveland–Akron metropolitan economy was $175 billion in 2019, the largest in Ohio, accounting for 25% of the state's GDP. 　Designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, Cleveland is home to several major cultural institutions, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 　Known as "The Forest City" among many other nicknames, Cleveland serves as the center of the Cleveland Metroparks nature reserve system. 　The city's major league professional sports teams include the Cleveland Browns, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Cleveland Guardians.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster>Monster</a> 

<font size=3>
A monster is a type of fictional creature found in horror, fantasy, science fiction, folklore, mythology and religion. 　Monsters are very often depicted as dangerous and aggressive with a strange, grotesque appearance that causes terror and fear. 　Monsters usually resemble bizarre, deformed, otherworldly and/or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of varying sizes, but may also take a human form, such as mutants, ghosts and spirits, zombies or cannibals, among other things. 　They may or may not have supernatural powers, but are usually capable of killing or causing some form of destruction, threatening the social or moral order of the human world in the process. 　Animal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice to Poseidon the white bull which the god sent him, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasiphaë, fall in love with the bull. She copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, the Minotaur). 　Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human (Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity (werewolves, Frankenstein's monster), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society. 　Monsters may also be depicted as misunderstood and friendly creatures who frighten individuals away without wanting to, or may be so large, strong and clumsy that they cause unintentional damage or death. 　Some monsters in fiction are depicted as mischievous and boisterous but not necessarily threatening (such as a sly goblin), while others may be docile but prone to becoming angry or hungry, thus needing to be tamed and taught to resist savage urges, or killed if they cannot be handled or controlled successfully. 　Monsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as monstrophy. 　Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. 　Well-known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, vampires, demons, mummies, and zombies.

<font size=3>
Identification is a psychological process whereby the individual assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other and is transformed wholly or partially by the model that other provides. 　It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. 　The roots of the concept can be found in Freud's writings. 　The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, narcissistic (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification. 　While "in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another", it has also been adjudged '"the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area" in psychoanalysis'.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(biology)>Identification (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Identification in biology is the process of assigning a pre-existing taxon name to an individual organism. 　Identification of organisms to individual scientific names (or codes) may be based on individualistic natural body features, experimentally created individual markers (e.g., color dot patterns), or natural individualistic molecular markers (similar to those used in maternity or paternity identification tests). 　Individual identification is used in ecology, wildlife management and conservation biology. 　The more common form of identification is the identification of organisms to common names (e. g., "lion") or scientific name (e. g., "Panthera leo"). 　By necessity this is based on inherited features ("characters") of the sexual organisms, the inheritance forming the basis of defining a class. 　The features may, e. 　g.　, be morphological, anatomical, physiological, behavioral, or molecular. 　The term "determination" may occasionally be used as a synonym for identification (e. g.), or as in "determination slips". 　Identification methods may be manual or computerized and may involve using identification keys, browsing through fields guide that contain (often illustrated) species accounts, comparing the organism with specimens from natural history collections, or taking images to be analyzed and compared against a pre-trained knowledge base with species information.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment>Payment</a> 

<font size=3>
A payment is the voluntary tender of money or its equivalent or of things of value by one party (such as a person or company) to another in exchange for goods or services provided by them or to fulfill a legal obligation. 　The party making the payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment. 　Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example: the use of money, cheque, or debit, credit, or bank transfers, whether through mobile payment or otherwise the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, or personal data, the exchange of one good or service for another. 　In general, payees are at liberty to determine what method of payment they will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit. 　Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee unless the parties agree otherwise. 　Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction. 　The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. 　On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc. 　Payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follows the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is not uncommon for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided. 　In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. 　In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer’s legal obligations. 　The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. 　A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. 　A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer. 　A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as "paid in full". 　The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.

<font size=3>
Determination is a positive emotional feeling that involves persevering towards a difficult goal in spite of obstacles. 　Determination occurs prior to goal attainment and serves to motivate behavior that will help achieve one's goal. 　Empirical research suggests that people consider determination to be an emotion; in other words, determination is not just a cognitive state, but rather an affective state. 　In the psychology literature, researchers have studied determination under other terms, including challenge and anticipatory enthusiasm; this may explain one reason for the relative lack of research on determination compared to other positive emotions. 　In the field of psychology, emotion research is heavily focused on negative emotions and the action tendencies that they encourage. 　However, recent work in positive psychology incorporates the study of determination as a positive emotion that pushes individuals toward action and results in important outcomes such as perseverance and determination take success.

A holiday is a day or other period of time set aside for festivals or recreation. 　Public holidays are set by public authorities and vary by state or region. 　Religious holidays are set by religious organisations for their members and are often also observed as public holidays in religious majority countries. 　Some religious holidays such as Christmas have become or are becoming secularised by part or all of those who observe it. 　In addition to secularisation, many holidays have become commercialised due to the growth of industry. 　Holidays can be thematic, celebrating or commemorating particular groups, events or ideas, or non-thematic, days of rest which do not have any particular meaning. 　In Commonwealth English, the term can refer to any period of rest from work, such as vacations or school holidays. 　In American English, the holidays typically refers to the period from Thanksgiving to New Year's, which contains many important holidays in American culture.

Purple is any of a variety of colors with hue between red and blue. 　In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, purples are produced by mixing red and blue light. 　In the RYB color model historically used by painters, purples are created with a combination of red and blue pigments. 　In the CMYK color model used in printing, purples are made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment, black pigment, or both. 　Purple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye, made from the mucus secretion of a species of snail, was extremely expensive in antiquity. 　Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. 　Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy. 　According to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States, purple is the color most often associated with rarity, royalty, magic, mystery, and piety. 　When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.

<font size=3>
Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. 　Advertising aims to put a product or service in the spotlight in hopes of drawing it attention from consumers. 　It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are wide range of uses, the most common being the commercial advertisement. 　Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. 　On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. 　Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. 　Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. 　Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. 　In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. 　Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster-girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. 　Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising. 　Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. 　Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor and 4.3% on radio. 　Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu. 　In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 24°N 121°E﻿ / ﻿24°N 121°E﻿ / 24; 121 Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a country in East Asia. 　It is located at the junction of the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the northwest, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. 　The territories controlled by the ROC consist of 168 islands, with a combined area of 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 sq mi). 　The main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. 　The capital, Taipei, forms along with New Taipei City and Keelung the largest metropolitan area of Taiwan. 　Other major cities include Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. 　With around 23.9 million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries in the world. 　Taiwan has been settled for at least 25,000 years. 　Ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around 6,000 years ago. 　In the 17th century, large-scale Han Chinese (specifically the Hakkas and Hoklos) immigration to western Taiwan began under a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning, the first predominantly Han Chinese state in Taiwanese history. 　The island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. 　The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing in 1911, took control of Taiwan following the surrender of Japan in 1945. 　Japan would renounce sovereignty over Taiwan in 1952. 　The immediate resumption of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the loss of the Chinese mainland to Communist forces who established the People's Republic of China, and the flight of the ROC central government to Taiwan in 1949. 　The effective jurisdiction of the ROC has since been limited to Taiwan, Penghu, and smaller islands. 　In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the "Taiwan Miracle". 　In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party state under martial law to a multi-party democracy, with democratically elected presidents since 1996. 　Taiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the 21st-largest in the world by nominal GDP and 19th-largest by PPP measures, with a focus on steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing. 　Taiwan is a developed country, ranking 20th on GDP per capita. 　It is ranked highly in terms of civil liberties, healthcare, and human development. 　The political status of Taiwan is contentious. 　The ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations, after UN members voted in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead. 　The ROC maintained its claim of being the sole legitimate representative of China and its territory, although this has been downplayed since its democratization in the 1990s. 　Taiwan is claimed by the PRC, which refuses diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC. 　Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with 13 out of 193 UN member states and the Holy See, though many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. 　International organisations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only on a non-state basis under various names. 　Domestically, the major political contention is between parties favouring eventual Chinese unification and promoting a pan-Chinese identity, contrasted with those aspiring to formal international recognition and promoting a Taiwanese identity; into the 21st century, both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration>Consideration</a> 

<font size=3>
Look up consideration in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Consideration is a concept of English common law and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by deed). 　The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions. 　The court in Currie v Misa declared consideration to be a “Right, Interest, Profit, Benefit, or Forbearance, Detriment, Loss, Responsibility”. 　Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. 　Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right. 　Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into contracts. 　Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as "consideration": for example, if A contracts to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the promise of $5,000, and B's consideration is the promise of the car. 　Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own house in any other colour than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also a consideration. 　Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. 　A's consideration to B is the forbearance in painting his own house in a colour other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. 　Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. 　However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it is a valid gift. 　In common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. 　The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. 　If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed. 　However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of quantum meruit (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or promissory estoppel.

A soundtrack is recorded music accompanying and synchronised to the images of a motion picture, drama, book, television program, radio program, or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film, video, or television presentation; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronised recorded sound. 　In movie industry terminology usage, a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production. 　Initially, the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a film each has its own separate track (dialogue track, sound effects track, and music track), and these are mixed together to make what is called the composite track, which is heard in the film. 　A dubbing track is often later created when films are dubbed into another language. 　This is also known as an M&E (music and effects) track. 　M&E tracks contain all sound elements minus dialogue, which is then supplied by the foreign distributor in the native language of its territory. 　Current dictionary entries for soundtrack document soundtrack as a noun, and as verb. 　An early attempt at popularizing the term “sound track” was printed in the magazine Photoplay in 1929. 　A 1992 technical dictionary entry in Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology does not distinguish between the form sound track and soundtrack. 　The contraction soundtrack came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called "soundtrack albums" in the late 1940s. 　First conceived by movie companies as a promotional gimmick for new films, these commercially available recordings were labeled and advertised as "music from the original motion picture soundtrack", or "music from and inspired by the motion picture." 　These phrases were soon shortened to just "original motion picture soundtrack." 　More accurately, such recordings are made from a film's music track, because they usually consist of isolated music from a film, not the composite (sound) track with dialogue and sound effects. 　The abbreviation OST is often used to describe the musical soundtrack on a recorded medium, such as CD, and it stands for original soundtrack; however, it is sometimes also used to differentiate the original music heard and recorded versus a rerecording or cover.

<font size=3>
Debt is an obligation that requires one party, the debtor, to pay money or other agreed-upon value to another party, the creditor. 　Debt is a deferred payment, or series of payments, which differentiates it from an immediate purchase. 　The debt may be owed by sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. 　Commercial debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. 　Loans, bonds, notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. 　In financial accounting, debt is a type of financial transaction, as distinct from equity. 　The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on a monetary value. 　For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a "debt of gratitude" to the second person.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter>Diameter</a> 

<font size=3>
In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. 　It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. 　Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere. 　In more modern usage, the length d {\displaystyle d} of a diameter is also called the diameter. 　In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r . 　{\displaystyle r.　} d = 2 r or equivalently r = d 2 . 　{\displaystyle d=2r\qquad {\text{or equivalently}}\qquad r={\frac {d}{2}}.　} For a convex shape in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to its boundary, and the width is often defined to be the smallest such distance. 　Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating calipers. 　For a curve of constant width such as the Reuleaux triangle, the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance. 　For an ellipse, the standard terminology is different. 　A diameter of an ellipse is any chord passing through the centre of the ellipse. 　For example, conjugate diameters have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the conjugate diameter. 　The longest diameter is called the major axis. 　The word "diameter" is derived from Ancient Greek: διάμετρος (diametros), "diameter of a circle", from διά (dia), "across, through" and μέτρον (metron), "measure". 　It is often abbreviated DIA , dia , d , {\displaystyle {\text{DIA}},{\text{dia}},d,} or ∅ . 　{\displaystyle \varnothing .　}

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture>Sculpture</a> 

<font size=3>
Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. 　Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. 　It is one of the plastic arts. 　Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. 　A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast. 　Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. 　However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost. 　Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. 　Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa. 　The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. 　During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. 　The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David. 　Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.

The trace in semiotics[citation needed] is a concept developed by Jacques Derrida in Writing and Difference to denote the history that a sign carries with it as the result of its use through time.　[page needed] Words like "black", for example, carry the trace of all their previous uses with them, making them sensitive, loaded words when used in any context. 　The trace then reveals the possibility for alternative interpretation of concepts, regardless of how carefully articulated they may be, whenever they are expressed in language.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment>Punishment</a> 

<font size=3>
Punishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority—in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. 　It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is. 　The reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law—and respect for rule of law—under which the social group is governed. 　Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion. 　The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable. 　The individual may be a person, or even an animal. 　The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family. 　Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. 　The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called "correctional process". 　Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention. 　Justifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. 　The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult. 　If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than "punishment" may be considered more accurate. 　Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority or not on the basis of a breach of rules is typically considered only revenge or spite rather than punishment. 　In addition, the word "punishment" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences "punishment" during a fight. 　In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. 　Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment. 　Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty. 　Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor. 　Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense. 　Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment_(psychology)>Punishment (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In operant conditioning, punishment is any change in a human or animal's surroundings which, occurring after a given behavior or response, reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. 　As with reinforcement, it is the behavior, not the human/animal, that is punished. 　Whether a change is or is not punishing is determined by its effect on the rate that the behavior occurs. 　This is called motivating operations (MO), because they alter the effectiveness of a stimulus. 　MO can be categorized in abolishing operations, decrease the effectiveness of the stimuli and establishing, increase the effectiveness of the stimuli. 　For example, a painful stimulus which would act as a punisher for most people may actually reinforce some behaviors of masochistic individuals. 　There are two types of punishment, positive and negative. 　Positive punishment involves the introduction of a stimulus to decrease behavior while negative punishment involves the removal of a stimulus to decrease behavior. 　While similar to reinforcement, punishment's goal is to decrease behaviors while reinforcement's goal is to increase behaviors. 　Different kinds of stimuli exist as well. 　There are rewarding stimuli which are considered pleasant and aversive stimuli, which are considered unpleasant. 　There are also two types of punishers. 　There are primary punishers which directly affect the individual such as pain and are a natural response and then there are secondary punishers which are things that are learned to be negative like a buzzing sound when getting an answer wrong on a game show. 　Conflicting findings have been found on the effectiveness of the use of punishment. 　Some have found that punishment can be a useful tool in suppressing behavior while some have found it to have a weak effect on suppressing behavior. 　Punishment can also lead to lasting negative unintended side effects as well. 　Punishment has been found to be effective in countries that are wealthy, high in trust, cooperation, and democracy. 　Punishment has been used in a lot of different applications. 　Punishment has been used in applied behavioral analysis, specifically in situations to try and punish dangerous behaviors like head banging. 　Punishment has also been used to psychologically manipulate individuals to gain control over victims. 　It has also been used in scenarios where an abuser may try punishment in order to traumatically bond their victim with them. 　Stuttering therapy has also seen the use of punishment with effective results. 　Certain punishment techniques have been effective in children with disabilities, such as autism and intellectual disabilities.

A scientist is a person who researches to advance knowledge in an area of the natural sciences. 　By modern definitions, many scientists are required to have advanced degrees in an area of science and careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofits pertaining to their discipline. 　In classical antiquity, there was no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. 　Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. 　Though Thales (circa 624–545 BC) was arguably the first scientist for describing how cosmic events may be seen as natural, not necessarily caused by gods, it was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.

Stochastic (/stəˈkæstɪk/, from Greek στόχος (stókhos) 'aim, guess') refers to the property of being well described by a random probability distribution. 　Although stochasticity and randomness are distinct in that the former refers to a modeling approach and the latter refers to phenomena themselves, these two terms are often used synonymously. 　Furthermore, in probability theory, the formal concept of a stochastic process is also referred to as a random process. 　Stochasticity is used in many different fields, including the natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, and physics, as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography, and telecommunications. 　It is also used in finance, due to seemingly random changes in financial markets as well as in medicine, linguistics, music, media, colour theory, botany, manufacturing, and geomorphology.

<font size=3>
In ecology, the term habitat summarises the array of resources, physical and biotic factors that are present in an area, such as to support the survival and reproduction of a particular species. 　A species habitat can be seen as the physical manifestation of its ecological niche. 　Thus "habitat" is a species-specific term, fundamentally different from concepts such as environment or vegetation assemblages, for which the term "habitat-type" is more appropriate. 　The physical factors may include (for example): soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity. 　Biotic factors will include the availability of food and the presence or absence of predators. 　Every species has particular habitat requirements, with habitat generalist species able to thrive in a wide array of environmental conditions while habitat specialist species requiring a very limited set of factors to survive. 　The habitat of a species is not necessarily found in a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss; a parasitic organism has as its habitat the body of its host, part of the host's body (such as the digestive tract), or a single cell within the host's body. 　Habitat types are environmental categorizations of different environments based on the characteristics of a given geographical area, particularly vegetation and climate. 　Thus habitat types do not refer to a single species but to multiple species living in the same area. 　For example, terrestrial habitat types include forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. 　Fresh-water habitat types include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds; marine habitat types include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, estuaries, reefs, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents. 　Habitat types may change over time. 　Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents); or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. 　Other changes come as a direct result of human activities, such as deforestation, the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. 　The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife – through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity.
