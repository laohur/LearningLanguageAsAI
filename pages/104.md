<font size=3>
Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) involves the vertical and horizontal dimensions of land surface. 　The term bathymetry is used to describe underwater relief, while hypsometry studies terrain relative to sea level. 　The Latin word terra (the root of terrain) means "earth." 　In physical geography, terrain is the lay of the land. 　This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation, slope, and orientation of terrain features. 　Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution. 　Over a large area, it can affect weather and climate patterns.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking>Smoking</a> 
<font size=3>
Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke is typically breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. 　Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small rectangle of rolling paper to create a small, round cylinder called a cigarette. 　Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. 　In the case of cigarette smoking, these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. 　In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment. 　Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. 　Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practised by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. 　Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. 　Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. 　Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. 　Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs. 　Smoking has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. 　Smoking tobacco is among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. 　Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. 　Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015. 　Non-smokers account for 600,000 deaths globally due to second-hand smoke. 　The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, publish advertisements to discourage use, limit advertisements that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke. 　Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. 　Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities; in cleansing rituals; or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. 　After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. 　In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). 　In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown. 　Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. 　In the last decade of the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries.

The Angles (Old English: Ængle, Engle; Latin: Angli) were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period. 　They founded several kingdoms of the Heptarchy in Anglo-Saxon England. 　Their name is the root of the name England ("land of Ængle"). 　According to Tacitus, writing around 100 AD, a people known as Angles (Anglii) lived east of the Lombards and Semnones, who lived near the Elbe river.

<font size=3>
Unlikely is the second album by Brazilian stoner rock band Far from Alaska, released on 4 August 2017. 　It was recorded in the United States, produced by Sylvia Massy and financed via a crowdfunding campaign. 　It is their last album with bassist Edu Filgueira, who left the band in January 2018. 　The band sees the album as a more unpretentious and free work than its predecessor, modeHuman, and believes it to be more representative of what they really are. 　They wanted to create songs that were easier to sing along in shows and that could be easily played with an acoustic guitar in a circle of friends, for example. 　In studio, the members, encouraged by Masy, experimented with a couple of different things, like playing synths with the cables going through electricity-conducting food. 　Like modeHuman, Unlikely was well received by the critics.

<font size=3>
A quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. 　The word serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. 　Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. 　In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. 　The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). 　The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. 　The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.

<font size=3>
Wilderness or wildlands (usually in the plural) are natural environments on Earth that have not been significantly modified by human activity or any nonurbanized land not under extensive agricultural cultivation. 　The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness. 　Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity. 　Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity. 　Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. 　These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas. 　Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation. 　They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resist>Resist</a> 
<font size=3>
A resist, used in many areas of manufacturing and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process. 　Often the resist is then removed. 　For example in the resist dyeing of textiles, wax or a similar substance is added to places where the dye is not wanted. 　The wax will "resist" the dye, and after it is removed there will be a pattern in two colours. 　Batik, shibori and tie-dye are among many styles of resist dyeing. 　Wax or grease can also be used as a resist in pottery, to keep some areas free from a ceramic glaze; the wax burns away when the piece is fired. 　Song dynasty Jizhou ware used paper cut-outs and leaves as resists or stencils under glaze to create patterns. 　Other uses of resists in pottery work with slip or paints, and a whole range of modern materials used as resists. 　A range of similar techniques can be used in watercolour and other forms of painting. 　While these artistic techniques stretch back centuries, a range of new applications of the resist principle have recently developed in microelectronics and nanotechnology. 　An example is resists in semiconductor fabrication, using photoresists (often just referred to as "resists") in photolithography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure>Cure</a> 
<font size=3>
A cure is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured. 　The medical condition could be a disease, mental illness, genetic disorder, or simply a condition a person considers socially undesirable, such as baldness or lack of breast tissue. 　An incurable disease may or may not be a terminal illness; conversely, a curable illness can still result in the patient's death. 　The proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment, called the cure fraction or cure rate, is determined by comparing disease-free survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease. 　Another way of determining the cure fraction and/or "cure time" is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population. 　Inherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease. 　When a person has the common cold, and then recovers from it, the person is said to be cured, even though the person might someday catch another cold. 　Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as diabetes mellitus, so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured. 　Related concepts, whose meaning can differ, include response, remission and recovery.

<font size=3>
A tent (/tɛnt/ (listen)) is a shelter consisting of sheets of fabric or other material draped over, attached to a frame of poles or a supporting rope. 　While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using guy ropes tied to stakes or tent pegs. 　First used as portable homes by nomads, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and as temporary shelters. 　Tents range in size from "bivouac" structures, just big enough for one person to sleep in, up to huge circus tents capable of seating thousands of people. 　Tents for recreational camping fall into two categories. 　Tents intended to be carried by backpackers are the smallest and lightest type. 　Small tents may be sufficiently light that they can be carried for long distances on a touring bicycle, a boat, or when backpacking. 　The second type are larger, heavier tents which are usually carried in a car or other vehicle. 　Depending on tent size and the experience of the person or people involved, such tents can usually be assembled (pitched) in between 5 and 25 minutes; disassembly (striking) takes a similar length of time. 　Some very specialised tents have spring-loaded poles and can be pitched in seconds, but take somewhat longer to strike (take down and pack). 　Over the past decade, tents have also been increasingly linked with homelessness crises in the United States, Canada, and other regions. 　Places of multiple homeless people living in tents closely pitched or plotted near each other are often referred to as tent cities.

In military operations, reconnaissance or scouting is the exploration of an area by military forces to obtain information about enemy forces, the terrain, and civil activities in the area of operations. 　In military jargon, reconnaissance is abbreviated to recce (British, Canadian, Australian English) and to recon (American English), both derived from the root word reconnoitre. 　The types of reconnaissance include patrolling the local area of operations and long-range reconnaissance patrols, which are tasks usually realized by U.S. Army Rangers, cavalry scouts, and military intelligence specialists, using navy ships and submarines, reconnaissance aircraft, satellites to collect raw intelligence; and establishing observation posts. 　Moreover, espionage is different from reconnaissance, because spies work as civilians in enemy territory.

Dispersion is a process that occurs in soils that are particularly vulnerable to erosion by water. 　In soil layers where clays are saturated with sodium ions ("sodic soils"), soil can break down very easily into fine particles and wash away. 　This can lead to a variety of soil and water quality problems, including: large soil losses by gully erosion and tunnel erosion Soil structural degradation, clogging and sealing where dispersed particles settle Suspended soil causing turbidity in water and transporting nutrients off the land.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral>Mineral</a> 
<font size=3>
In geology and mineralogy, a mineral or mineral species is, broadly speaking, a solid chemical compound with a fairly well-defined chemical composition and a specific crystal structure that occurs naturally in pure form. 　The geological definition of mineral normally excludes compounds that occur only in living organisms. 　However, some minerals are often biogenic (such as calcite) or are organic compounds in the sense of chemistry (such as mellite). 　Moreover, living organisms often synthesize inorganic minerals (such as hydroxylapatite) that also occur in rocks. 　The concept of mineral is distinct from rock, which is any bulk solid geologic material that is relatively homogeneous at a large enough scale. 　A rock may consist of one type of mineral, or may be an aggregate of two or more different types of minerals, spacially segregated into distinct phases. 　Some natural solid substances without a definite crystalline structure, such as opal or obsidian, are more properly called mineraloids. 　If a chemical compound occurs naturally with different crystal structures, each structure is considered a different mineral species. 　Thus, for example, quartz and stishovite are two different minerals consisting of the same compound, silicon dioxide. 　The International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is the generally recognized standard body for the definition and nomenclature of mineral species. 　As of November 2022[update], the IMA recognizes 5,863 official mineral species. 　The chemical composition of a named mineral species may vary somewhat by the inclusion of small amounts of impurities. 　Specific varieties of a species sometimes have conventional or official names of their own. 　For example, amethyst is a purple variety of the mineral species quartz. 　Some mineral species can have variable proportions of two or more chemical elements that occupy equivalent positions in the mineral's structure; for example, the formula of mackinawite is given as (Fe,Ni) 9S 8, meaning Fe xNi 9-xS 8, where x is a variable number between 0 and 9. 　Sometimes a mineral with variable composition is split into separate species, more or less arbitrarily, forming a mineral group; that is the case of the silicates Ca xMg yFe 2-x-ySiO 4, the olivine group. 　Besides the essential chemical composition and crystal structure, the description of a mineral species usually includes its common physical properties such as habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting, specific gravity, magnetism, fluorescence, radioactivity, as well as its taste or smell and its reaction to acid. 　Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. 　Silicate minerals comprise approximately 90% of the Earth's crust. 　Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.

A toy or plaything is an object that is used primarily to provide entertainment. 　Simple examples include toy blocks, board games, and dolls. 　Toys are often designed for use by children, although many are designed specifically for adults and pets. 　Toys can provide utilitarian benefits, including physical exercise, cultural awareness, or academic education. 　Additionally, utilitarian objects, especially those which are no longer needed for their original purpose, can be used as toys. 　Examples include children building a fort with empty cereal boxes and tissue paper spools, or a toddler playing with a broken TV remote control. 　The term "toy" can also be used to refer to utilitarian objects purchased for enjoyment rather than need, or for expensive necessities for which a large fraction of the cost represents its ability to provide enjoyment to the owner, such as luxury cars, high-end motorcycles, gaming computers, and flagship smartphones. 　Playing with toys can be an enjoyable way of training young children for life experiences. 　Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. 　Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment and smart toys. 　Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only. 　The origin of toys is prehistoric; dolls representing infants, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults, are readily found at archaeological sites. 　The origin of the word "toy" is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. 　Toys are mainly made for children. 　The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old. 　Playing with toys is an important part of aging. 　Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help with cognition, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, become stronger physically, and practice skills needed in adulthood. 　Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.

<font size=3>
Perturbation (from Latin: perturbare "to confuse, disorder, disturb", from per- "through" + turbare "disturb, confuse," from turba "turmoil, crowd") is a set of pedology (soil study) and sedimentary geology processes relating to changes in the nature of water-borne alluvial sediments and in situ soil deposits over time. 　Pedoturbation (from Greek: πέδον (pédon), "soil") involves mixing between soil horizons, and is an important factor in soil formation. 　Pedoturbation includes churning clays, cryoturbation, and bioturbation. 　Types of bioturbation include faunal pedoturbation (animal burrowing), and floral pedoturbation (root growth, tree-uprootings). 　Pedoturbation transforms soils through destratification, mixing, and sorting, as well as creating preferential flow paths for soil gas and infiltrating water. 　The zone of active bioturbation is termed the soil biomantle. 　Soil perturbation that is not pedoturbation. 　Precipitation of surface salts also causes localized disruption of soils. 　Because it does not result in mixing between soil horizons, it is not considered pedoturbation. 　In geology, bioturbation is the displacement and mixing of sediment particles (i.e. sediment reworking) and solutes (i.e. biologically-mediated irrigation) by benthic zone (bottom water) fauna (animals) or flora (plants). 　Activity of bacteria is yet another important cause of perturbation in the geological record. 　Field termites are especially important in tropical climate regions within 15° of the equator.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass>Brass</a> 
<font size=3>
Brass is an alloy of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), in proportions which can be varied to achieve different colours and mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties, but copper typically has the larger proportion. 　In use since prehistoric times, it is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. 　Brass is similar to bronze, another copper alloy that uses tin instead of zinc. 　Both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic (As), lead (Pb), phosphorus (P), aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), and silicon (Si). 　Historically, the distinction between the two alloys has been less consistent and clear, and increasingly museums use the more general term "copper alloy." 　Brass has long been a popular material for its bright gold-like appearance and is still used for drawer pulls and doorknobs. 　It has also been widely used to make sculpture and utensils because of its low melting point, high workability (both with hand tools and with modern turning and milling machines), durability, and electrical and thermal conductivity. 　Brasses with higher copper content are softer and more golden in colour; conversely those with less copper and thus more zinc are harder are more silver in colour. 　Brass is still commonly used in applications where corrosion resistance and low friction are required, such as locks, hinges, gears, bearings, ammunition casings, zippers, plumbing, hose couplings, valves, and electrical plugs and sockets. 　It is used extensively for musical instruments such as horns and bells. 　The composition of brass, generally 66% copper and 34% zinc, makes it a favorable substitute for copper in costume jewelry and fashion jewelry, as it exhibits greater resistance to corrosion. 　Brass is not as hard as bronze, and so is not suitable for most weapons and tools nor marine uses, because the zinc reacts with minerals in salt water, leaving porous copper behind; Marine bronze, with added tin, avoids this, as does bronze. 　Brass is often used in situations in which it is important that sparks not be struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario>Mario</a> 
<font size=3>
Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. 　He is the title character of the video game franchise of the same name and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. 　Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. 　Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. 　Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. 　Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi. 　Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. 　Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. 　Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. 　Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. 　He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. 　Since 1992, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet. 　After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. 　These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. 　He has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. 　Mario has also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. 　He will be voiced by Chris Pratt in the upcoming 2023 film adaptation. 　Mario is near-unanimously considered to be the most famous character in the video game industry and an established pop culture icon. 　Mario's likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. 　He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media. 　With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail>Sail</a> 
<font size=3>
Sail rigs A sail is a tensile structure—which is made from fabric or other membrane materials—that uses wind power to propel sailing craft, including sailing ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles. 　Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials—including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments—usually in a three- or four-sided shape. 　A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack—its angle with respect to the apparent wind. 　Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. 　Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail. 　On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface—just as an airplane wing generates lift—which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion. 　The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. 　Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind. 　Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. 　They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet. 　In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. 　Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points. 　Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.
