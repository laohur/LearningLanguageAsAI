<font size=3>
In general, flux in biology relates to movement of a substance between compartments. 　There are several cases where the concept of flux is important. 　The movement of molecules across a membrane: in this case, flux is defined by the rate of diffusion or transport of a substance across a permeable membrane. 　Except in the case of active transport, net flux is directly proportional to the concentration difference across the membrane, the surface area of the membrane, and the membrane permeability constant. 　In ecology, flux is often considered at the ecosystem level – for instance, accurate determination of carbon fluxes using techniques like eddy covariance (at a regional and global level) is essential for modeling the causes and consequences of global warming. 　Metabolic flux refers to the rate of flow of metabolites through a biochemical network, along a linear metabolic pathway, or through a single enzyme. 　A calculation may also be made of carbon flux or flux of other elemental components of biomolecules (e.g. nitrogen). 　The general unit of flux is chemical mass /time (e.g., micromole/minute; mg/kg/minute). 　Flux rates are dependent on a number of factors, including: enzyme concentration; the concentration of precursor, product, and intermediate metabolites; post-translational modification of enzymes; and the presence of metabolic activators or repressors. 　Metabolic flux in biologic systems can refer to biosynthesis rates of polymers or other macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, polynucleotides, or complex carbohydrates, as well as the flow of intermediary metabolites through pathways. 　Metabolic control analysis and flux balance analysis provide frameworks for understanding metabolic fluxes and their constraints.

Flux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. 　Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications to physics. 　For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. 　In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface.

<font size=3>
Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. 　It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. 　Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds. 　In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. 　It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. 　For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).

<font size=3>
Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. 　Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. 　Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response. 　Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. 　As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics. 　Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. 　While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest out of four primary strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as for training. 　There are various risks present during swimming, mainly due to it taking place in water. 　Swimmers are at risk of incapacitation due to panic and exhaustion, which may cause death due to drowning. 　Other dangers include getting an infection or contact with hostile aquatic fauna. 　To minimize these risks, most facilities employ a lifeguard to look for signs of distress. 　Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the culture of the area, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. 　In addition to this, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.

Dublin (/ˈdʌblɪn/; Irish: Baile Átha Cliath, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of Ireland. 　On a bay at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster, bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. 　At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,173,179, while the preliminary results of the 2022 census recorded that County Dublin as a whole had a population of 1,450,701, and that the population of the Greater Dublin Area was over 2 million, or roughly 40% of the Republic of Ireland's total population. 　A settlement was established in the area by the Gaels during or before the 7th century, followed by the Vikings. 　As the Kingdom of Dublin grew, it became Ireland's principal settlement by the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. 　The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest in the British Empire and sixth largest in Western Europe after the Acts of Union in 1800. 　Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937. 　Dublin is a centre for education, arts and culture, administration and industry. 　As of 2018[update], the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the world.

<font size=3>
Quebec (/k(w)ɪˈbɛk/ k(w)ih-BEK; French: Québec [kebɛk] (listen)) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. 　It is the largest province by area and the second-largest by population. 　Much of the population lives in urban areas along the St. Lawrence River, between the most populous city, Montreal, and the provincial capital, Quebec City. 　Quebec is the home of the Québécois nation. 　Located in Central Canada, the province shares land borders with Ontario to the west, Newfoundland and Labrador to the northeast, New Brunswick to the southeast, and a coastal border with Nunavut; in the south it borders Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York in the United States. 　Between 1534 and 1763, Quebec was called Canada and was the most developed colony in New France. 　Following the Seven Years' War, Quebec became a British colony: first as the Province of Quebec (1763–1791), then Lower Canada (1791–1841), and lastly Canada East (1841–1867), as a result of the Lower Canada Rebellion. 　It was confederated with Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in 1867, beginning the Dominion of Canada. 　Until the early 1960s, the Catholic Church played a large role in the social and cultural institutions in Quebec. 　However, the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1980s increased the role of the Government of Quebec in l'État québécois (the state of Quebec). 　The Government of Quebec functions within the context of a Westminster system and is both a liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy. 　The Premier of Quebec, presently François Legault, acts as head of government. 　Québécois political culture mostly differs on a nationalist-vs-federalist continuum, rather than a left-vs-right continuum. 　Independence debates have played a large role in politics. 　Quebec society's cohesion and specificity is based on three of its unique statutory documents: the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, the Charter of the French Language, and the Civil Code of Quebec. 　Furthermore, unlike elsewhere in Canada, law in Quebec is mixed: private law is exercised under a civil-law system, while public law is exercised under a common-law system. 　Quebec's official language is French; Québécois French is the regional variety. 　The economy of Quebec is mainly supported by its large service sector and varied industrial sector. 　For exports, it leans on the key industries of aeronautics, hydroelectricity, mining, pharmaceuticals, aluminum, wood, and paper. 　Quebec is well known for producing maple syrup, for its comedy, and for making hockey one of the most popular sports in Canada. 　It is also renowned for its culture; the province produces literature, music, films, TV shows, festivals, folklore, and more.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing>Sharing</a> 
<font size=3>
Sharing is the joint use of a resource or space. 　It is also the process of dividing and distributing. 　In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common pasture or a shared residence. 　Still more loosely, "sharing" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to "share" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. 　Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being. 　Apart from obvious instances, which can be observed in human activity, many examples can be found in nature. 　When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen, for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. 　Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. 　In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as nonrival goods, such as information.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention>Intention</a> 
<font size=3>
Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action. 　Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention. 　The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content. 　Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan. 　Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so. 　Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs. 　Theories of intention try to capture the characteristic features of intentions. 　The belief-desire theory is the traditionally dominant approach. 　According to a simple version of it, having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action. 　Belief-desire theories are frequently criticized based on the fact that neither beliefs nor desires involve a practical commitment to performing an action, which is often illustrated in various counterexamples. 　The evaluation theory tries to overcome this problem by explaining intentions in terms of unconditional evaluations. 　That is to say that intentions do not just present the intended course of action as good in some respect, as is the case for desires, but as good all things considered. 　This approach has problems in explaining cases of akrasia, i.e. that agents do not always intend what they see as the best course of action. 　A closely related theory identifies intentions not with unconditional evaluations but with predominant desires. 　It states that intending to do something consists in desiring it the most. 　Opponents of this approach have articulated various counterexamples with the goal of showing that intentions do not always coincide with the agent's strongest desire. 　A different approach to the theories mentioned so far is due to Elizabeth Anscombe and denies the distinction between intentions and actions. 　On her view, to intend a goal is already a form of acting towards this goal and therefore not a distinct mental state. 　This account struggles to explain cases in which intentions and actions seem to come apart, as when the agent is not currently doing anything towards realizing their plan or in the case of failed actions. 　The self-referentiality theory suggests that intentions are self-referential, i.e. that they do not just represent the intended course of action but also represent themselves as the cause of the action. 　But the claim that this happens on the level of the content of the intention has been contested. 　The term "intention" refers to a group of related phenomena. 　For this reason, theorists often distinguish various types of intentions in order to avoid misunderstandings. 　The most-discussed distinction is that between prospective and immediate intentions. 　Prospective intentions, also known as "prior intentions", involve plans for the future. 　They can be subdivided according to how far they plan ahead: proximal intentions involve plans for what one wants to do straightaway whereas distal intentions are concerned with a more remote future. 　Immediate intentions, on the other hand, are intentions that guide the agent while they are performing the action in question. 　They are also called "intentions-in-action" or "act-related" intentions. 　The term "intention" usually refers to anticipated means or ends that motivate the agent. 　But in some cases, it can refer to anticipated side-effects that are neither means nor ends to the agent. 　In this case, the term "oblique intention" is sometimes used. 　Intentions are rationally evaluable: they are either rational or irrational. 　Conscious intentions are the paradigmatic form of intention: in them, the agent is aware of their goals. 　But it has been suggested that actions can also be guided by unconscious intentions of which the agent is not aware. 　The formation of intentions is sometimes preceded by the deliberation of promising alternative courses of action and may happen in decisions, in which the agent chooses between these alternatives. 　Intentions are responsible for initiating, sustaining, and terminating actions and are frequently used to explain why people engage in a certain behavior. 　Understanding the behavior of others in terms of intentions already happens in early childhood. 　Important in this context is the role of gestures, pointing, attention, and eye movement to understand the intentions of others and to form shared intentions. 　In the philosophy of action, a central question is whether it is true for all intentional actions that they are caused or accompanied by intentions. 　The theory of reasoned action aims to predict behavior based on how pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms determine behavioral intentions. 　In ethics, the intention principle states that whether an action is morally permissible sometimes depends on the agent's intention for performing this action.

A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. 　It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and it is that sense which is retained in modern usage of the term. 　The word entered the English language from the Old French charte, via Latin chartacode: lat promoted to code: la , and ultimately from Greek χάρτης (khartes, meaning "layer of papyrus"). 　It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.

<font size=3>
A schedule or a timetable, as a basic time-management tool, consists of a list of times at which possible tasks, events, or actions are intended to take place, or of a sequence of events in the chronological order in which such things are intended to take place. 　The process of creating a schedule — deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the variety of possible tasks — is called scheduling, and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may be called a scheduler. 　Making and following schedules is an ancient human activity. 　Some scenarios associate this kind of planning with learning life skills. 　Schedules are necessary, or at least useful, in situations where individuals need to know what time they must be at a specific location to receive a specific service, and where people need to accomplish a set of goals within a set time period. 　Schedules can usefully span both short periods, such as a daily or weekly schedule, and long-term planning with respect to periods of several months or years. 　They are often made using a calendar, where the person making the schedule can note the dates and times at which various events are planned to occur. 　Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list algorithmically an expected order in which events either can or must take place. 　In some situations, schedules can be uncertain, such as where the conduct of daily life relies on environmental factors outside human control. 　People who are vacationing or otherwise seeking to reduce stress and achieve relaxation may intentionally avoid having a schedule for a certain period of time.

<font size=3>
Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. 　Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. 　Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. 　More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination. 　It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. 　Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). 　Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. 　Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing. 　The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product's target market. 　Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements. 　The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut>Connecticut</a> 
<font size=3>
Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ (listen)) is the southernmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. 　Its capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. 　Historically, the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey. 　The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. 　The word "Connecticut" is derived from various anglicized spellings of "Quinnetuket”, a Mohegan-Pequot word for "long tidal river". Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called House of Hope in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. Connecticut was one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution. It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. Connecticut is the third smallest state by area, the 29th most populous, and the fourth most densely populated of the fifty states. It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". 　The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. 　The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford County and hedge funds in Fairfield County. 　As of the 2010 census, it has the highest per-capita income, second-highest level of human development behind Massachusetts, and highest median household income in the United States.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 56°N 10°E﻿ / ﻿56°N 10°E﻿ / 56; 10 Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic constituent country in Northern Europe. 　It is the most populous and politically central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean. 　Metropolitan Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying south-west of Sweden, south of Norway, and north of Germany. 　As of 2013, the Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, has a total of 1,419 islands above 100 square metres (1,100 sq ft); 443 of which have been named and of which 78 are inhabited. 　Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi), metropolitan Denmark consists of the northern part of the Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands. 　Of these, the most populated island is Zealand, on which the capital Copenhagen is situated, followed by Funen, the North Jutlandic Island, and Amager. 　Denmark's geography is characterised by flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevation, and a temperate climate. 　As of 2022, it had a population of 5.928 million (1 October 2022), of which 800,000 live in the capital and largest city, Copenhagen. 　Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. 　Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the latter obtained further autonomy in 2009. 　The unified Kingdom of Denmark emerged in the eighth century as a proficient maritime power amid the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. 　In 1397, it joined Norway and Sweden to form the Kalmar Union, which persisted until the latter's secession in 1523. 　The remaining Kingdom of Denmark–Norway endured a series of wars in the 17th century that resulted in further territorial cessions to the Swedish Empire. 　Following the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was absorbed into Sweden, leaving Denmark with the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. 　A surge of nationalist movements in the 19th century were defeated in the First Schleswig War of 1848, though the Second Schleswig War of 1864 resulted in further territorial losses to Prussia. 　The period saw the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy that was established in 1660 and introducing the current parliamentary system. 　An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century, which formed the basis for the present welfare state model and advanced mixed economy. 　Denmark remained neutral during World War I but regained the northern half of Schleswig in 1920. 　Danish neutrality was violated in World War II following a swift German invasion in April 1940. 　During occupation, a resistance movement emerged in 1943 while Iceland declared independence in 1944; Denmark was liberated in May 1945. 　In 1973, Denmark, together with Greenland but not the Faroes, became a member of what is now the European Union, but negotiated certain opt-outs, such as retaining its own currency, the krone. 　Denmark is a highly developed country with a high standard of living: the country performs at or near the top in measures of education, health care, civil liberties, democratic governance and LGBT equality. 　Denmark is a founding member of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area. 　Denmark maintains close political, cultural, and linguistic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours, with the Danish language being partially mutually intelligible with both Norwegian and Swedish.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listening>Listening</a> 
<font size=3>
Listening is giving attention to a sound or action. 　When listening, a person hears what others are saying and tries to understand what it means. 　The act of listening involves complex affective, cognitive and behavioral processes. 　Affective processes include the motivation to listen to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding to others with verbal and nonverbal feedback. 　Listening is a skill for creating problems. 　Poor listening can lead to misinterpretations, thus causing conflict or a dispute. 　Other causes can be excessive interruptions, inattention, hearing what you want to hear, mentally composing a response, and having a closed mind. 　Listening is also linked to memory. 　According to one study, during a speech some background noises heard by listeners helped them recall some of the information by hearing it again. 　For example, when a person reads or does something else while listening to music, he or she can recall what that was when hearing the music again later. 　Listening also functions rhetorically as a means of promoting the cross-culture communicative discourses. 　Ratcliffe built her argument upon two incidents in which individuals demonstrated a tendency to refuse the cross-cultural discourses.

A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. 　Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage. 　Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami). 　There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: the former, except for February 29, occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the complete date when a person was born (e.g. January 15, 2001).
