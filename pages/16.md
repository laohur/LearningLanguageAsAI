<font size=3>
The term yield is used to describe the volume of water escaping from a spring over a certain period of time, the discharge quantity of which is measured in [l/s]. 　Measurement methods include volume–filling-time measurement and water level measurement. 　The discharge of a spring can fluctuate to a greater or lesser extent depending on precipitation and evaporation. 　Karst springs show particularly large time-dependent differences in the discharge.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver>Vancouver</a> 

<font size=3>
Vancouver (/vænˈkuːvər/ (listen) van-KOO-vər) is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. 　As the most populous city in the province, the 2021 Canadian census recorded 662,248 people in the city, up from 631,486 in 2016. 　The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2.6 million in 2021, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. 　Greater Vancouver, along with the Fraser Valley, comprises the Lower Mainland with a regional population of over 3 million. 　Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with over 5,700 people per square kilometre, and fourth highest in North America (after New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City). 　Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 49.3 percent of its residents are not native English speakers, 47.8 percent are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 54.5 percent of residents belong to visible minority groups. 　It has been consistently ranked one of the most livable cities in Canada and in the world. 　In terms of housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the most expensive cities in Canada and in the world. 　Vancouver plans to become the greenest city in the world. 　Vancouverism is the city's urban planning design philosophy. 　Indigenous settlement of Vancouver began more than 10,000 years ago, and included the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples. 　The beginnings of the modern city, which was originally named Gastown, grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings Mill that was built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor Gassy Jack. 　The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. 　Gastown then formally registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. 　The city was renamed "Vancouver" in 1886, through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway. 　The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. 　The city's large natural seaport on the Pacific Ocean became a vital link in the trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada. 　Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several matches of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup including the finals at BC Place in Downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city. 　In 1969, Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver. 　The city became the permanent home to TED conferences in 2014. 　As of 2016[update], the Port of Vancouver is the fourth-largest port by tonnage in the Americas, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. 　While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. 　Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the nickname "Hollywood North".

<font size=3>
A touchdown (abbreviated as TD) is a scoring play in gridiron football. 　Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. 　In American football, a touchdown is worth six points and is followed by an extra point or two-point conversion attempt.

<font size=3>
A physician (American English), medical practitioner (Commonwealth English), medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a health professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. 　Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. 　Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine. 　Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. 　Degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration, compassion, and benevolence for their patients.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear>Gear</a> 

<font size=3>
A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another (compatible) toothed part to transmit (convert) torque and speed. 　The basic principle behind the operation of gears is analogous to the basic principle of levers. 　A gear may also be known informally as a cog. 　Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. 　Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. 　The rotational speeds, and the torques, of two meshing gears differ in proportion to their diameters. 　The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape. 　Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a gear train or a transmission. 　The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed, belt pulley system. 　An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage. 　In transmissions with multiple gear ratios—such as bicycles, motorcycles, and cars—the term "gear" (e.g., "first gear") refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear. 　The term describes similar devices, even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete, or when the device does not actually contain gears, as in a continuously variable transmission (CVT). 　Sometimes a CVT is referred to as an "infinitely variable transmission". 　Furthermore, a gear can mesh with a linear toothed part, called a rack, producing movement in a straight line instead of rotation (movement in a circle). 　See Rack and Pinion for an example.

<font size=3>
Absorption is a disposition or personality trait in which a person becomes absorbed in their mental imagery, particularly fantasy. 　This trait thus correlates highly with a fantasy prone personality. 　The original research on absorption was by American psychologist Auke Tellegen. 　The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. 　Absorption has a variable correlation with hypnotisability (r = 0.13–0.89) perhaps because in addition to broad personality dispositions, situational factors play an important role in performance on tests of hypnotic susceptibility. 　Absorption is one of the traits assessed in the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire.

<font size=3>
Absorption is the journey of a drug travelling from the site of administration to the site of action. 　The drug travels by some route of administration (oral, topical-dermal, etc.) in a chosen dosage form (e.g., tablets, capsules, or in solution). 　Absorption by some other routes, such as intravenous therapy, intramuscular injection, enteral nutrition, is even more straightforward and there is less variability in absorption and bioavailability is often near 100%. 　Intravascular administration does not involve absorption, and there is no loss of drug. 　The fastest route of absorption is inhalation. 　Absorption is a primary focus in drug development and medicinal chemistry, since a drug must be absorbed before any medicinal effects can take place. 　Moreover, the drug's pharmacokinetic profile can be easily and significantly changed by adjusting factors that affect absorption.

A première, also spelled premiere, is the debut (first public presentation) of a play, film, dance, or musical composition. 　A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world), its first presentation in each country, and an online première (the first time it is published on the Internet). 　When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play The Maids by the French dramatist Jean Genet received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. 　Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain.

<font size=3>
Maine (/meɪn/ (listen)) is the easternmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It borders New Hampshire to the west, the Gulf of Maine to the southeast, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and northwest, respectively. 　The largest state by total area in New England, Maine is the 12th-smallest by area, the 9th-least populous, the 13th-least densely populated, and the most rural of the 50 U.S. states. 　It is also the northeasternmost among the contiguous United States, the northernmost state east of the Great Lakes, the only state whose name consists of a single syllable, and the only state to border exactly one other U.S. state. 　Approximately half the area of Maine lies on each side of the 45th parallel north in latitude. 　The most populous city in Maine is Portland, while its capital is Augusta. 　Maine has traditionally been known for its jagged, rocky Atlantic Ocean and bayshore coastlines; smoothly contoured mountains; heavily forested interior; picturesque waterways; and its wild lowbush blueberries and seafood cuisine, especially lobster and clams. 　Coastal and Down East Maine have emerged as important centers for the creative economy, especially in the vicinity of Portland, which is also bringing gentrification. 　The territory of Maine has been inhabited by aboriginal populations for thousands of years after the glaciers retreated during the last ice age. 　At the time of European arrival, several Algonquian-speaking nations governed the area and these nations are now known as the Wabanaki Confederacy. 　The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island, founded by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons. 　The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony, established by the Plymouth Company in 1607. 　A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate and conflict with the local Indigenous people caused many to fail. 　As Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. 　Loyalist and Patriot forces contended for Maine's territory during the American Revolution. 　During the War of 1812, the largely undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces with the goal of annexing it to Canada via the Colony of New Ireland, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that restored the pre-war boundaries. 　Maine was part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. 　On March 15, 1820, under the Missouri Compromise, it was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke>Stroke</a> 

<font size=3>
A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. 　There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. 　Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. 　Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. 　Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. 　If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. 　A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. 　The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. 　Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control. 　The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. 　Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. 　An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. 　A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. 　Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. 　Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. 　A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. 　Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. 　Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. 　Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. 　Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. 　A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. 　An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. 　Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. 　Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world. 　In 2013, approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. 　In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. 　Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. 　In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). 　About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. 　About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. 　Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.

<font size=3>
A ferry is a ship, watercraft or amphibious vehicle used to carry passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo, across a body of water. 　A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, Italy, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi. 　Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. 　Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services, and many carry vehicles.

<font size=3>
In grammar, a phrase—called expression in some contexts—is a group of words or singular word acting as a grammatical unit. 　For instance, the English expression "the very happy squirrel" is a noun phrase which contains the adjective phrase "very happy". 　Phrases can consist of a single word or a complete sentence. 　In theoretical linguistics, phrases are often analyzed as units of syntactic structure such as a constituent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying>Crying</a> 

<font size=3>
Crying is the dropping of tears (or welling of tears in the eyes) in response to an emotional state, or pain. 　Emotions that can lead to crying include sadness, anger, and even happiness. 　The act of crying has been defined as "a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures", instead, giving a relief which protects from conjunctivitis. 　A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. 　Various forms of crying are known as sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering. 　For crying to be described as sobbing, it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms, such as slow but erratic inhalation, occasional instances of breath holding and muscular tremor. 　A neuronal connection between the lacrimal gland and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established.　[citation needed] Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. 　They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and Leu-enkephalin, and the elements potassium and manganese.

Coordinates: 35°N 38°E﻿ / ﻿35°N 38°E﻿ / 35; 38 Syria (Arabic: سُورِيَا or سُورِيَة, romanized: Sūriyā), officially the Syrian Arab Republic (Arabic: الجمهورية العربية السورية, romanized: al-Jumhūrīyah al-ʻArabīyah as-Sūrīyah), is a Western Asian country located in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant. 　It is a unitary republic that consists of 14 governorates (subdivisions), and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east and southeast, Jordan to the south, and Israel and Lebanon to the southwest. 　Cyprus lies to the west across the Mediterranean Sea. 　A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including the majority Syrian Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Armenians, Circassians, Albanians, and Greeks. 　Religious groups include Muslims, Christians, Alawites, Druze, and Yazidis. 　The capital and largest city of Syria is Damascus. 　Arabs are the largest ethnic group, and Muslims are the largest religious group. 　Syria is the only country that is governed by Ba'athism, an ideology that advocates Arab socialism and Arab nationalism. 　The name "Syria" historically referred to a wider region, broadly synonymous with the Levant, and known in Arabic as al-Sham. 　The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC. 　Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. 　In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. 　The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman rule. 　After a period as a French mandate (1923–1946), the newly created state represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces. 　It gained de jure independence as a democratic parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 when the Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate (although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946). 　The post-independence period was tumultuous, with multiple military coups and coup attempts shaking the country between 1949 and 1971. 　In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the United Arab Republic, which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. 　The republic was renamed as the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after the December 1 constitutional referendum of that year. 　A significant event was the 1963 coup d'état carried out by the military committee of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party which established a one-party state. 　Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending the constitutional protections for citizens. 　Internal power-struggles within neo-Ba'athist factions caused further coups in 1966 and 1970, which eventually resulted in the seizure of power by General Hafez al-Assad. 　Assad assigned Alawite loyalists to key posts in the armed forces, bureaucracy, Mukhabarat and the ruling elite; effectively establishing an "Alawi minority rule" to consolidate power within his family. 　After the death of Hafez al-Assad in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad inherited the presidency and political system centred around a cult of personality to al-Assad family. 　The Ba'ath regime has been condemned for numerous human rights abuses, including frequent executions of citizens and political prisoners, massive censorship and for financing a multi-billion dollar illicit drug trade. 　Syria is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement. 　Following its violent suppression of Arab Spring protests of the 2011 Syrian Revolution, the Syrian government was suspended from the Arab League in November 2011 and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean in December 2011. 　Since July 2011, Syria has been embroiled in a multi-sided civil war, with the involvement of different countries. 　The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria in August 2012 citing "deep concern at the massacres and inhuman acts" perpetrated by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad. 　As of 2020, three political entities – the Syrian Interim Government, Syrian Salvation Government and Rojava – have emerged in Syrian territory to challenge Assad's rule. 　Syria was ranked last on the Global Peace Index from 2016 to 2018, making it the most violent country in the world due to the war. 　Syria is the most corrupt country in the MENA region and was ranked the second lowest ("second to the worst") globally on the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index. 　The Syrian civil war has killed more than 570,000 people, with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of the total civilian casualties. 　The war led to the Syrian refugee crisis, with an estimated 7.6 million internally displaced people (July 2015 UNHCR figure) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by UNHCR), making population assessment difficult in recent years. 　The war has also worsened economic conditions, with more than 90% of population living under poverty and 80% of Syrians face food insecurity.

<font size=3>
Discrimination is the act of making unjustified, prejudiced distinctions between people based on the groups, classes, or other categories to which they belong or are perceived to belong. 　People may be discriminated on the basis of race, gender, age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation, as well as other categories. 　Discrimination especially occurs when individuals or groups are unfairly treated in a way which is worse than other people are treated, on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories. 　It involves restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group. 　Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. 　In some places, attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. 　These attempts have often been met with controversy, and have sometimes been called reverse discrimination.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity>Trinity</a> 

<font size=3>
The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus 'threefold') is the central doctrine concerning the nature of God in most Christian churches, which defines one God existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons sharing one homoousion (essence) "each is God, complete and whole." 　As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. 　In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is. 　This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. 　Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes "from the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Holy Spirit." 　This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called Trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. 　Christian nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism. 　While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. 　The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians and fathers of the Church as they attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions. 　Though the Trinity is mainly a Christian concept, Judaism has had parallel views, especially among writings from the kabbalah tradition.

<font size=3>
Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, eating and/or working with an item, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). 　Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). 　Furniture can be a product of design and can be considered a form of decorative art. 　In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. 　It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. 　Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflects the local culture. 　People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites. 　Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. 　Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne. 　The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. 　Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt. 　This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. 　The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. 　The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented. 　Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. 　The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. 　The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles. 　The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. 　One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_(Chinese zoology)>Mo (Chinese zoology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Mo (貘) was the standard Chinese name for the giant panda from the 3rd century BCE to the 19th century CE, but in 1824, the French sinologist Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat mistakenly identified the mo as the recently discovered black-and-white Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), which never inhabited China in historical times. 　He based this misidentification on Chinese woodblock illustrations that depicted a mythological mo (貘) chimera with elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail and tiger paws (also known as the Japanese baku 獏), which the famous Tang poet Bai/Bo Juyi first described in the 9th century. 　The consequences of Abel-Rémusat's error were extensive. 　His presumption that mo meant "Chinese tapir" was immediately adopted in Western zoology, and by the end of the 19th century, it was accepted as modern scientific fact in China and Japan. 　In the 20th century, since mo had lost its original meaning, the giant panda was given a new Chinese name da xiongmao (大熊貓 lit. "large bear cat").

A subsidiary, subsidiary company or daughter company is a company owned or controlled by another company, which is called the parent company or holding company. 　Two or more subsidiaries that either belong to the same parent company or having a same management being substantially controlled by same entity/group are called sister companies. 　The subsidiary can be a company (usually with limited liability) and may be a government- or state-owned enterprise. 　They are a common feature of modern business life, and most multinational corporations organize their operations in this way. 　Examples of holding companies are Berkshire Hathaway, Jefferies Financial Group, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. 　Discovery, or Citigroup; as well as more focused companies such as IBM, Xerox, and Microsoft. 　These, and others, organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries, often with multiple levels of subsidiaries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving>Saving</a> 

<font size=3>
Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. 　Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash. 　Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs. 　In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. 　Saving does not automatically include interest. 　Saving differs from savings. 　The former refers to the act of not consuming one's assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one's assets in the form of cash. 　Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. 　This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to "saving" as "savings". 　In different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. 　For example, the part of a person's income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. 　However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as "saving" unless the institutions and people who receive them save them. 　Saving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter. 　By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. 　Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth. 　However, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. 　If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. 　This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. 　In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. 　In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. 　Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. 　However, savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to an (interest-free) loan to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan. 　In a primitive agricultural economy, savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. 　If the whole crop were consumed the economy would convert to hunting and gathering the next season.

<font size=3>
The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 　It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 　An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. 　It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. 　Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own. 　The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. 　It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. 　Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. 　What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra. 　The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 　As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most populations living in small isolated pockets. 　India currently hosts the largest tiger population. 　Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. 　Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density. 　The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. 　It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. 　The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mess>Mess</a> 

<font size=3>
The mess (also called a mess deck aboard ships) is a designated area where military personnel socialize, eat and (in some cases) live. 　The term is also used to indicate the groups of military personnel who belong to separate messes, such as the officers' mess, the chief petty officer mess, and the enlisted mess. 　In some civilian societies this military usage has been extended to the eating arrangements of other disciplined services such as fire fighting and police forces. 　The root of mess is the Old French mes, "portion of food" (cf. modern French mets), drawn from the Latin verb mittere, meaning "to send" and "to put" (cf. modern French mettre), the original sense being "a course of a meal put on the table"; cfr. 　also the modern Italian portata with the same meaning, past participle of portare, to bring. 　This sense of mess, which appeared in English in the 13th century, was often used for cooked or liquid dishes in particular, as in the "mess of pottage" (porridge or soup) or Eton mess.

A sphere (from Ancient Greek σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'globe, ball') is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle. 　A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space. 　That given point is the centre of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius. 　The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians. 　The sphere is a fundamental object in many fields of mathematics. 　Spheres and nearly-spherical shapes also appear in nature and industry. 　Bubbles such as soap bubbles take a spherical shape in equilibrium. 　The Earth is often approximated as a sphere in geography, and the celestial sphere is an important concept in astronomy. 　Manufactured items including pressure vessels and most curved mirrors and lenses are based on spheres. 　Spheres roll smoothly in any direction, so most balls used in sports and toys are spherical, as are ball bearings.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity>Christianity</a> 

<font size=3>
Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. 　It is the world's largest and most widespread religion with roughly 2.4 billion followers representing one-third of the global population. 　Its adherents, known as Christians, are estimated to make up a majority of the population in 157 countries and territories, and believe that Jesus is the Son of God, whose coming as the Messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and chronicled in the New Testament. 　Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century Hellenistic Judaism in the Roman province of Judea. 　Jesus' apostles and their followers spread around the Levant, Europe, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, the South Caucasus, Ancient Carthage, Egypt, and Ethiopia, despite significant initial persecution. 　It soon attracted gentile God-fearers, which led to a departure from Jewish customs, and, after the Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism, Christianity slowly separated from Judaism. 　Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. 　The creeds of various Christian denominations generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news". 　Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, with the Old Testament as the gospel's respected background. 　Emperor Constantine the Great decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire (380). 　The early history of Christianity's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the "Great Church" (though divergent sects existed at the same time, including Gnostics, Marcionites, and Jewish Christians). 　The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus (431) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon (451) over differences in Christology, while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East–West Schism (1054), mostly over the authority of the bishop of Rome. 　Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century) over theological and ecclesiological disputes, most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome. 　Christianity played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly in Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages. 　Following the Age of Discovery (15th–17th century), Christianity was spread into the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world via missionary work and European colonialism especially during the period of new imperialism. 　The four largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion), Protestantism (800 million), the Eastern Orthodox Church (220 million), and the Oriental Orthodox churches (60 million), though thousands of smaller church communities exist despite efforts toward unity (ecumenism). 　Despite a decline in adherence in the West, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the region, with about 70% of that population identifying as Christian. 　Christianity is growing in Africa and Asia, the world's most populous continents. 　Christians remain greatly persecuted in many regions of the world, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement>Requirement</a> 

<font size=3>
In product development and process optimization, a requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy. 　It is commonly used in a formal sense in engineering design, including for example in systems engineering, software engineering, or enterprise engineering. 　It is a broad concept that could speak to any necessary (or sometimes desired) function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, internal user, or other stakeholder. 　Requirements can come with different levels of specificity; for example, a requirement specification or requirement "spec" (often imprecisely referred to as "the" spec/specs, but there are actually different sorts of specifications) refers to an explicit, highly objective/clear (and often quantitative) requirement (or sometimes, set of requirements) to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. 　A set of requirements is used as inputs into the design stages of product development. 　Requirements are also an important input into the verification process, since tests should trace back to specific requirements. 　Requirements show what elements and functions are necessary for the particular project. 　When iterative methods of software development or agile methods are used, the system requirements are incrementally developed in parallel with design and implementation. 　With the waterfall model requirements are developed before design and implementation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft>Craft</a> 

<font size=3>
A craft or trade is a pastime or an occupation that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. 　In a historical sense, particularly the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. 　The traditional term craftsman is nowadays often replaced by artisan and by craftsperson (craftspeople). 　Historically, the more specialized crafts with high-value products tended to concentrate in urban centers and formed guilds. 　The skill required by their professions and the need to be permanently involved in the exchange of goods often demanded a generally higher level of education, and craftsmen were usually in a more privileged position than the peasantry in societal hierarchy. 　The households of craftsmen were not as self-sufficient as those of people engaged in agricultural work, and therefore had to rely on the exchange of goods. 　Some crafts, especially in areas such as pottery, woodworking, and various stages of textile production, could be practiced on a part-time basis by those also working in agriculture, and often formed part of village life. 　When an apprentice finished his apprenticeship, he became a journeyman searching for a place to set up his own shop and make a living. 　After he set up his own shop, he could then call himself a master of his craft. 　This stepwise approach to mastery of a craft, which includes the attainment of some education and skill, has survived in some countries until today. 　But crafts have undergone deep structural changes since and during the era of the Industrial Revolution. 　The mass production of goods by large-scale industry has limited crafts to market segments in which industry's modes of functioning or its mass-produced goods do not satisfy the preferences of potential buyers. 　As an outcome of these changes, craftspeople today increasingly make use of semi-finished components or materials and adapt these to their customers' requirements or demands. 　Thus, they participate in a certain division of labour between industry and craft.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(psychology)>Closure (psychology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Closure or need for closure (NFC), used interchangeably with need for cognitive closure (NFCC), are social psychological terms that describe an individual's desire for a clear, firm answer or peaceful resolution to a question or problem to avert ambiguity. 　The term "need" denotes a motivated tendency to seek out information. 　The need for closure is the motivation to find an answer to an ambiguous situation. 　This motivation is enhanced by the perceived benefits of obtaining closure, such as the increased ability to predict the world and a stronger basis for action. 　This motivation is also enhanced by the perceived costs of lacking closure, such as dealing with uncertainty. 　A sense of closure is not usually possible with ambiguous loss, such as a missing person, and the hoped-for benefits, such as a sense of relief after the death of a person who inflicted harm, are not necessarily obtained. 　Because of this mismatch between what individuals hope will happen if they achieve closure and what they actually experience, the idea of getting closure has been described as a myth. 　The level of the need for cognitive closure is a fairly stable individual characteristic. 　It can affect what information individuals seek out and how they process it. 　This need can be affected by situational factors. 　For example, in the presence of circumstances that increase the need for closure, individuals are more likely to use simple cognitive structures to process information. 　According to Kruglanski et al., need for closure exerts its effects via two general tendencies: the urgency tendency (the inclination to attain closure as quickly as possible) and the permanence tendency (the tendency to maintain it for as long as possible). 　Together, these tendencies may produce the inclinations to seize and then freeze on early judgmental cues, reducing the extent of information processing and hypothesis generation and introducing biases in thinking.

<font size=3>
Social closure refers to the phenomenon by which groups maintain their resources by the exclusion of others from their group based on varied criteria. 　Closure is ubiquitous, being found in groups all over the world at all sizes and classes. 　Some examples of social closure include, “Access to private schools follows explicit rules and depends on financial capacities; access to university depends on a certificate or diploma, eventually from certain schools only; membership in a highly prestigious club depends on economic and social capital and the respective social networks; and finally, in the case of migration, people will have to be eligible for citizenship and pass the thorny path of naturalization.”

<font size=3>
In topology, the closure of a subset S of points in a topological space consists of all points in S together with all limit points of S. The closure of S may equivalently be defined as the union of S and its boundary, and also as the intersection of all closed sets containing S. Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in S or "near" S. A point which is in the closure of S is a point of closure of S. The notion of closure is in many ways dual to the notion of interior.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis>Hypothesis</a> 

<font size=3>
A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. 　For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. 　Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 　Even though the words "hypothesis" and "theory" are often used interchangeably, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. 　A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought. 　A different meaning of the term hypothesis is used in formal logic, to denote the antecedent of a proposition; thus in the proposition "If P, then Q", P denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); Q can be called a consequent. 　P is the assumption in a (possibly counterfactual) What If question. 　The adjective hypothetical, meaning "having the nature of a hypothesis", or "being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis", can refer to any of these meanings of the term "hypothesis".

<font size=3>
Laughter is a pleasant physical reaction and emotion consisting usually of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. 　It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. 　Laughter can rise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. 　Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, or relief. 　On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. 　Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. 　Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling. 　Laughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. 　Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others. 　Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback. 　The study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity>Luminosity</a> 

<font size=3>
Luminosity is an absolute measure of radiated electromagnetic power (light), the radiant power emitted by a light-emitting object over time. 　In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit of time by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical objects. 　In SI units, luminosity is measured in joules per second, or watts. 　In astronomy, values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the luminosity of the Sun, L⊙. 　Luminosity can also be given in terms of the astronomical magnitude system: the absolute bolometric magnitude (Mbol) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission rate, while absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity within some specific wavelength range or filter band. 　In contrast, the term brightness in astronomy is generally used to refer to an object's apparent brightness: that is, how bright an object appears to an observer. 　Apparent brightness depends on both the luminosity of the object and the distance between the object and observer, and also on any absorption of light along the path from object to observer. 　Apparent magnitude is a logarithmic measure of apparent brightness. 　The distance determined by luminosity measures can be somewhat ambiguous, and is thus sometimes called the luminosity distance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion>Emotion</a> 

<font size=3>
Emotions are mental states brought on by neurophysiological changes, variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. 　There is currently no scientific consensus on a definition. 　Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or creativity. 　Research on emotion has increased over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology, medicine, history, sociology of emotions, and computer science. 　The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, function and other aspects of emotions have fostered more intense research on this topic. 　Current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion. 　In addition, PET scans and fMRI scans help study the affective picture processes in the brain. 　From a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as "a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity." 　Emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. 　The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and kin selection. 　In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. 　Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. 　Consciously experiencing an emotion is exhibiting a mental representation of that emotion from a past or hypothetical experience, which is linked back to a content state of pleasure or displeasure. 　The content states are established by verbal explanations of experiences, describing an internal state. 　Emotions are complex. 　There are various theories on the question of whether or not emotions cause changes in our behaviour. 　On the one hand, the physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system. 　Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. 　Extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. 　Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation. 　On the other hand, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behaviour, and physiological changes, but none of these components is the emotion. 　Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components. 　Emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. 　At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on. 　More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. 　The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. 　In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. 　A similar multi-componential description of emotion is found in sociology. 　For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts. 　Nowadays most research into emotions in the clinical and well-being context focuses on emotion dynamics in daily life, predominantly the intensity of specific emotions, and their variability, instability, inertia, and differentiation, and whether and how emotions augment or blunt each other over time, and differences in these dynamics between people and along the lifespan.

<font size=3>
Liberation is the first step in the process by which medication enters the body and liberates the active ingredient that has been administered. 　The pharmaceutical drug must separate from the vehicle or the excipient that it was mixed with during manufacture. 　Some authors split the process of liberation into three steps: disintegration, disaggregation and dissolution. 　A limiting factor in the adsorption of pharmaceutical drugs is the degree to which they are ionized, as cell membranes are relatively impermeable to ionized molecules. 　The characteristics of a medication's excipient play a fundamental role in creating a suitable environment for the correct absorption of a drug. 　This can mean that the same dose of a drug in different forms can have different bioequivalence, as they yield different plasma concentrations and therefore have different therapeutic effects. 　Dosage forms with modified release (such as delayed or extended release) allow this difference to be usefully applied.

<font size=3>
Exploration is the process of exploring, an activity which has some expectation of discovery. 　Organised exploration is largely a human activity, but exploratory activity is common to most organisms capable of directed locomotion and the ability to learn, and has been described in, amongst others, social insects foraging behaviour, where feedback from returning individuals affects the activity of other members of the group. 　Exploration has been defined as: To travel somewhere in search of discovery. 　To examine or investigate something systematically. 　To examine diagnostically. 　To (seek) experience first hand. 　To wander without any particular aim or purpose. 　In all these definitions there is an implication of novelty, or unfamiliarity or the expectation of discovery in the exploration, whereas a survey implies directed examination, but not necessarily discovery of any previously unknown or unexpected information. 　The activities are not mutually exclusive, and often occur simultaneously to a variable extent. 　The same field of investigation or region may be explored at different times by different explorers with different motivations, who may make similar or different discoveries. 　Intrinsic exploration involves activity that is not directed towards a specific goal other than the activity itself. 　Extrinsic exploration has the same meaning as appetitive behavior.　[clarification needed] It is directed towards a specific goal.

<font size=3>
Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services. 　ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 defines innovation as "a new or changed entity realizing or redistributing value". 　Others have different definitions; a common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, and spread of ideas or technologies. 　Innovation often takes place through the development of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, art works or business models that innovators make available to markets, governments and society. 　Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention: innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in a market or society, and not all innovations require a new invention. 　Technical innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. 　The opposite of innovation is exnovation.

<font size=3>
Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ (listen) ə-LAS-kə) is a U.S. state on the northwest extremity of North America. 　A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders British Columbia and the Yukon in Canada to the east, and it shares a western maritime border in the Bering Strait with the Russian Federation's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. 　To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. 　Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states of Texas, California, and Montana combined, and is the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. 　It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. 　The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area, and the former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. 　Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. 　Indigenous people have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, and it is widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. 　The Russian Empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state, and promoted and maintained a native Alaskan Creole population. 　The expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to $140 million in 2021). 　The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912. 　It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959. 　Abundant natural resources have enabled Alaska—with one of the smallest state economies—to have one of the highest per capita incomes, with commercial fishing, and the extraction of natural gas and oil, dominating Alaska's economy. 　U.S. Armed Forces bases and tourism also contribute to the economy; more than half the state is federally-owned land containing national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges. 　The Indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent. 　Various Indigenous languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives are influential in local and state politics.

A hallway or corridor is an interior space in a building that is used to connect other rooms. 　Hallways are generally long and narrow. 　Hallways must be sufficiently wide to ensure buildings can be evacuated during a fire, and to allow people in wheelchairs to navigate them. 　The minimum width of a hallway is governed by building codes. 　Minimum widths in residences are 36 inches (910 mm) in the United States. 　Hallways are wider in higher-traffic settings, such as schools and hospitals. 　In 1597 John Thorpe is the first recorded architect to replace multiple connected rooms with rooms along a corridor each accessed by a separate door.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer>Drummer</a> 

<font size=3>
A drummer is a percussionist who creates music using drums. 　Most contemporary western bands that play rock, pop, jazz, or R&B music include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. 　The drummer's equipment includes a drum kit (or "drum set" or "trap set"), which includes various drums, cymbals and an assortment of accessory hardware such as pedals, standing support mechanisms, and drum sticks. 　Particularly in the traditional music of many countries, drummers use individual drums of various sizes and designs rather than drum kits. 　Some use only their hands to strike the drums. 　In larger ensembles, the drummer may be part of a rhythm section with other percussionists playing. 　These musicians provide the timing and rhythmic foundation which allow the players of melodic instruments, including voices, to coordinate their musical performance. 　Some famous drummers include: Max Roach, Ringo Starr (The Beatles), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Ginger Baker (Cream), Keith Moon (The Who), Neil Peart (Rush), Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, Brian Blade, Jack DeJohnette, Tim "Herb" Alexander (Primus), Phil Rudd (AC/DC), Roger Taylor (Queen), Charlie Watts (The Rolling Stones), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Bill Ward (Black Sabbath), Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Travis Barker (Blink-182), Phil Collins (Genesis), Rick Allen (Def Leppard), Alex Van Halen (Van Halen), Tré Cool (Green Day), Dave Grohl (Nirvana), Joey Jordison (Slipknot), Lars Ulrich (Metallica), Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe), and James “The Rev” Sullivan (Avenged Sevenfold). 　As well as the primary rhythmic function, in some musical styles, such as world, jazz, classical, and electronica, the drummer is called upon to provide solo and lead performances, at times when the main feature of the music is the rhythmic development. 　Drummers tend to possess considerable stamina and hands-eyes-legs coordination. 　There are many tools that a drummer can use for either timekeeping or soloing. 　These include cymbals (china, crash, ride, splash, hi-hats, etc.), snare, toms, auxiliary percussion (bells, Latin drums, cowbells, temple blocks) and many others. 　There are also single, double, and triple bass pedals that drummers may use for the bass drum.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion>Mansion</a> 

<font size=3>
A mansion is a large dwelling house. 　The word itself derives through Old French from the Latin word mansio "dwelling", an abstract noun derived from the verb manere "to dwell". 　The English word manse originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself, but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this way (compare a Roman or medieval villa). 　Manor comes from the same root—territorial holdings granted to a lord who would "remain" there. 　Following the fall of Rome, the practice of building unfortified villas ceased. 　Today, the oldest inhabited mansions around the world usually began their existence as fortified houses in the Middle Ages. 　As social conditions slowly changed and stabilised fortifications were able to be reduced, and over the centuries gave way to comfort. 　It became fashionable and possible for homes to be beautiful rather than grim and forbidding allowing for the development of the modern mansion. 　In British English, a mansion block refers to a block of flats or apartments designed for the appearance of grandeur. 　In many parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Japan, the word mansion also refers to a block of apartments. 　In modern Japan, a "manshon" (Japanese: マンション), stemming from the English word "mansion", is used to refer to a multi-unit apartment complex or condominium.

<font size=3>
In biology, tissue is a historically derived biological organizational level between cells and a complete organ. 　A tissue is therefore often thought of as assembly of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. 　Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. 　The English word "tissue" derives from the French word "tissu", the past participle of the verb tisser, "to weave". 　The study of tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, as histopathology. 　Xavier Bichat is considered as the "Father of Histology". 　Plant histology is studied in both plant anatomy and physiology. 　The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. 　Developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue-sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. 　With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.

A presentation conveys information from a speaker to an audience. 　Presentations are typically demonstrations, introduction, lecture, or speech meant to inform, persuade, inspire, motivate, build goodwill, or present a new idea/product. 　Presentations usually require preparation, organization, event planning, writing, use of visual aids, dealing with stress, and answering questions. 　“The key elements of a presentation consists of presenter, audience, message, reaction and method to deliver speech for organizational success in an effective manner.” 　Presentations are widely used in tertiary work settings such as accountants giving a detailed report of a company's financials or an entrepreneur pitching their venture idea to investors. 　The term can also be used for a formal or ritualized introduction or offering, as with the presentation of a debutante. 　Presentations in certain formats are also known as keynote address. 　Interactive presentations, in which the audience is involved, are also represented more and more frequently. 　Instead of a monologue, this creates a dialogue between the speaker and the audience. 　The advantages of an interactive presentation is for example, that it attracts more attention from the audience and that the interaction creates a sense of community.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake>Snake</a> 

<font size=3>
Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes /sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/. 　Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. 　Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). 　To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. 　Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. 　Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards. 　These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae). 　Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans. 　Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. 　Around thirty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species. 　They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length. 　The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long. 　Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago. 　The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). 　The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus. 　Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. 　Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. 　Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance>Resonance</a> 

<font size=3>
Resonance describes the phenomenon of increased amplitude that occurs when the frequency of an applied periodic force (or a Fourier component of it) is equal or close to a natural frequency of the system on which it acts. 　When an oscillating force is applied at a resonant frequency of a dynamic system, the system will oscillate at a higher amplitude than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies. 　Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a relative maximum are also known as resonant frequencies or resonance frequencies of the system. 　Small periodic forces that are near a resonant frequency of the system have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations in the system due to the storage of vibrational energy. 　Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or waves: there is mechanical resonance, orbital resonance, acoustic resonance, electromagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) and resonance of quantum wave functions. 　Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., musical instruments), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters). 　The term resonance (from Latin resonantia, 'echo', from resonare, 'resound') originated from the field of acoustics, particularly the sympathetic resonance observed in musical instruments, e.g., when one string starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different one is struck.

Missile In military terminology, a missile is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor. 　Missiles are thus also called guided missiles or guided rockets (when a previously unguided rocket is made guided). 　Missiles have five system components: targeting, guidance system, flight system, engine and warhead. 　Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-submarine, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. 　Airborne explosive devices without propulsion are referred to as shells if fired by an artillery piece and bombs if dropped by an aircraft. 　Unguided jet- or rocket-propelled weapons are usually described as rocket artillery. 　Historically, the word missile referred to any projectile that is thrown, shot or propelled towards a target; this usage is still recognized today – this is in fact one sense of the Latin missile from which the English word is borrowed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback>Feedback</a> 

<font size=3>
Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. 　The system can then be said to feed back into itself. 　The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems: Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. 　This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole. 　As provided by Webster, feedback in business is the transmission of evaluative or corrective information about an action, event, or process to the original or controlling source. 　— Karl Johan Åström and Richard M.Murray, Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat>Bat</a> 

<font size=3>
Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera. 　With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight. 　Bats are more agile in flight than most birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. 　The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. 　The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus), reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in). 　The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species. 　These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. 　But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. 　Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters). 　A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood. 　Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators. 　Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. 　They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services. 　Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages. 　Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser. 　Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides and other insect management measures. 　They are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim. 　However, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by fruit growers. 　Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves. 　If humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans. 　Some bats are also predators of mosquitoes, suppressing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. 　Depending on the culture, bats may be symbolically associated with positive traits, such as protection from certain diseases or risks, rebirth, or long life, but in the West, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, vampires, and death.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust>Thrust</a> 

<font size=3>
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's third law. 　When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system. 　The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. 　Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second. 　In mechanical engineering, force orthogonal to the main load (such as in parallel helical gears) is referred to as static thrust.

<font size=3>
Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. 　It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. 　Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures. 　Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures. 　As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways. 　A ballet as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production. 　Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. 　Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery.

<font size=3>
Bristol (/ˈbrɪstəl/ (listen)) is a city, ceremonial county and unitary authority in England. 　Situated on the River Avon, it is bordered by the ceremonial counties of Gloucestershire to the north and Somerset to the south. 　Bristol is the most populous city in South West England. 　The wider Bristol Built-up Area is the eleventh most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. 　Iron Age hillforts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon. 　Around the beginning of the 11th century, the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English: 'the place at the bridge'). 　Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373 when it became a county corporate. 　From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities, after London, in tax receipts. 　A major port, Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. 　On a ship out of Bristol in 1497, John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European to land on mainland North America. 　In 1499, William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. 　At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. 　The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock. 　Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries; the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. 　The city has the largest circulating community currency in the UK, the Bristol Pound, which is pegged to the pound sterling. 　The city has two universities: the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol). 　There are a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. 　It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road and rail, and to the world by sea and air: road, by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32); rail, via Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations; and Bristol Airport. 　Bristol was named the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017; it won the European Green Capital Award in 2015.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise>Praise</a> 

<font size=3>
Praise as a form of social interaction expresses recognition, reassurance or admiration. 　Praise is expressed verbally as well as by body language (facial expression and gestures). 　Verbal praise consists of a positive evaluations of another's attributes or actions, where the evaluator presumes the validity of the standards on which the evaluation is based.　[clarification needed] As a form of social manipulation, praise becomes a form of reward and furthers behavioral reinforcement by conditioning. 　The influence of praise on an individual can depend on many factors, including the context, the meanings the praise may convey, and the characteristics and interpretations of the recipient. 　While praise may share some predictive relationships (both positive and negative) with tangible (material) rewards, praise tends to be less salient and expected, conveys more information about competence, and is typically given more immediately after the desired behavior. 　Praise is distinct from acknowledgement or feedback (more neutral forms of recognition) and from encouragement (expressedly future-oriented). 　Praise is given across social hierarchy, and both within the ingroup and towards an outgroup; it is an important aspect in the regulation of social hierarchy and the maintenance of group cohesion, influencing the potential for political action and social upheaval. 　When given by a dominant individual it takes the form of recognition and reassurance; when given by a submissive to a dominant individual it takes the form of deference, admiration or exultation, or deification. 　Praise of gods may form part of religious rites and practices (see for example prayer of praise and praise and worship).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull>Skull</a> 

<font size=3>
The skull is a bone protective cavity for the brain. 　The skull is composed of four types of bone i.e., cranial bones, facial bones, ear ossicles and hyoid bone. 　However two parts are more prominent: the cranium and the mandible. 　In humans, these two parts are the neurocranium and the viscerocranium (facial skeleton) that includes the mandible as its largest bone. 　The skull forms the anterior-most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisation—housing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. 　In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton. 　Functions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds. 　In some animals, such as horned ungulates (mammals with hooves), the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the frontal bone) for the horns. 　The English word skull is probably derived from Old Norse skulle, while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root κρανίον (kranion). 　The human skull fully develops two years after birth.The junctions of the skull bones are joined by structures called sutures. 　The skull is made up of a number of fused flat bones, and contains many foramina, fossae, processes, and several cavities or sinuses. 　In zoology there are openings in the skull called fenestrae.

<font size=3>
An engagement or betrothal is the period of time between the declaration of acceptance of a marriage proposal and the marriage itself (which is typically but not always commenced with a wedding). 　During this period, a couple is said to be fiancés (from the French), betrothed, intended, affianced, engaged to be married, or simply engaged. 　Future brides and grooms may be called fiancée (feminine) or fiancé (masculine), the betrothed, a wife-to-be or husband-to-be, respectively. 　The duration of the courtship varies vastly, and is largely dependent on cultural norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved. 　Long engagements were once common in formal arranged marriages, and it was not uncommon for parents betrothing children to arrange marriages many years before the engaged couple were old enough. 　This is still done in some countries. 　Many traditional Christian denominations have optional rites for Christian betrothal (also known as 'blessing an engaged couple' or 'declaration of intention') that bless and ratify the intent of a couple to marry before God and the Church.

Lighting or illumination is the deliberate use of light to achieve practical or aesthetic effects. 　Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. 　Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. 　This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. 　Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, or have positive psychological effects on occupants. 　Indoor lighting is usually accomplished using light fixtures, and is a key part of interior design. 　Lighting can also be an intrinsic component of landscape projects.

A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. 　A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. 　Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics. 　Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. 　By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. 　Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers. 　The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. 　These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. 　Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. 　These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics. 　From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling humans and other animals, such as animatronics, designed primarily as entertainment. 　As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control. 　The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. 　The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor. 　Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. 　The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal robotics company, Unimation. 　The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey. 　Robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. 　There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. 　Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions. 　The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. 　The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.

<font size=3>
Neil is a masculine name of Gaelic and Irish origin. 　The name is an anglicisation of the Irish Niall which is of disputed derivation. 　The Irish name may be derived from words meaning "cloud", "passionate", "victory", "honour" or "champion". 　As a surname, Neil is traced back to Niall of the Nine Hostages who was an Irish king and eponymous ancestor of the Uí Néill and MacNeil kindred. 　Most authorities cite the meaning of Neil in the context of a surname as meaning "champion".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_(Greek mythology)>Giants (Greek mythology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In Greek and Roman mythology, the Giants, also called Gigantes (Greek: Γίγαντες, Gígantes, singular: Γίγας, Gígas), were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size. 　They were known for the Gigantomachy (or Gigantomachia), their battle with the Olympian gods. 　According to Hesiod, the Giants were the offspring of Gaia (Earth), born from the blood that fell when Uranus (Sky) was castrated by his Titan son Cronus. 　Archaic and Classical representations show Gigantes as man-sized hoplites (heavily armed ancient Greek foot soldiers) fully human in form. 　Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Gigantes with snakes for legs. 　In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with other opponents of the Olympians, particularly the Titans, an earlier generation of large and powerful children of Gaia and Uranus. 　The vanquished Giants were said to be buried under volcanoes and to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

<font size=3>
Lucy is an English feminine given name derived from the Latin masculine given name Lucius with the meaning as of light (born at dawn or daylight, maybe also shiny, or of light complexion). 　Alternative spellings are Luci, Luce, Lucie, Lucia, and Luzia. 　The English Lucy surname is taken from the Norman language that was Latin-based and derives from place names in Normandy based on Latin male personal name Lucius. 　It was transmitted to England after the Norman Conquest in the 11th century (see also De Lucy).

<font size=3>
An advocate is a professional in the field of law. 　Different countries' legal systems use the term with somewhat differing meanings. 　The broad equivalent in many English law–based jurisdictions could be a barrister or a solicitor. 　However, in Scottish, Manx, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, Israeli, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, "Advocate" indicates a lawyer of superior classification. 　"Advocate" is in some languages an honorific for lawyers, such as "Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili". 　"Advocate" also has the everyday meaning of speaking out to help someone else, such as patient advocacy or the support expected from an elected politician; this article does not cover those senses.

<font size=3>
Rebuilt is the second and final studio album by the American girl group Girlicious. 　The album was released on November 22, 2010, by Universal Music Canada. 　The album draws from the dance-pop genre while infusing hints of R&B. 　Production initially started in 2009, after former member Tiffanie Anderson parted citing personal differences between the girls. 　The album has sparked four singles and one promotional single; The first being, "Over You" which was released on January 5, 2010. 　The song reached number fifty-two on the Canadian Hot 100. 　"Maniac" was released on April 6, 2010 as the album's second single. 　The song peaked lower than its previous single reaching number seventy-four. 　"Drank" was released on July 20, 2010 to Canada and to the United States as a promotional song for "Rebuilt" as well as being included on Jersey Shore's album soundtrack. 　The album's third single entitled "2 In The Morning" reached a peak of thirty-five giving the group their highest-charting single since "Stupid Shit". 　"Hate Love" was released on February 21, 2011 to Canadian radio stations as the group's fourth and final single from the album. 　Rebuilt was the only album released following the departure of group member Tiffanie Anderson, and was the last album released with group members Chrystina Sayers, Nichole Cordova, and Natalie Mejia, and the last to be released by the group itself.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb>Suburb</a> 

<font size=3>
A suburb, more broadly suburban area, is an area within a metropolitan area that is primarily a residential area, though may also include commercial and mixed-use areas. 　A suburb can exist either as part of a larger city/urban area or as a separate political entity. 　The name describes an area which is not as densely populated as an inner city, yet more densely populated than a rural area in the countryside. 　In many metropolitan areas, suburbs exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city (cf "bedroom suburb".) Suburbs can have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom, where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities. 　In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a "neighborhood" in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas. 　In some areas, such as India, China, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl. 　In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough. 　In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are known as "exurban areas" or exurbs; exurbs have less population density than suburbs, but still more than rural areas. 　Suburbs and exurbs are linked to the nearby larger metropolitan area economically, particularly by commuters. 　Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting. 　In general, they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs, planned communities, and satellite cities. 　Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe>Globe</a> 

<font size=3>
A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of the celestial sphere. 　Globes serve purposes similar to maps, but unlike maps, they do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down. 　A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe. 　A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe. 　A globe shows details of its subject. 　A terrestrial globe shows landmasses and water bodies. 　It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines. 　Some have raised relief to show mountains and other large landforms. 　A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. 　Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations. 　The word globe comes from the Latin word globus, meaning "sphere". 　Globes have a long history. 　The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC. 　The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, made by Martin Behaim in 1492. 　The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire.

The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change in a single period (such as time or spatial period). 　The amplitude of a non-periodic signal is its magnitude compared with a reference value. 　There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the differences between the variable's extreme values. 　In older texts, the phase of a periodic function is sometimes called the amplitude.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary>Dictionary</a> 

<font size=3>
A dictionary is a listing of lexemes from the lexicon of one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by radical and stroke for ideographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. 　It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data. 　A broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. 　Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. 　Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. 　In theory, general dictionaries are supposed[citation needed] to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. 　In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. 　There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. 　The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary. 　There is also a contrast between prescriptive or descriptive dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. 　Stylistic indications (e.g. "informal" or "vulgar") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive. 　The first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times around 2300 BCE, in the form of bilingual dictionaries, and the oldest surviving monolingual dictionaries are Chinese dictionaries c. 　3rd century BCE. 　The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was A Table Alphabeticall, written in 1604, and monolingual dictionaries in other languages also began appearing in Europe at around this time. 　The systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest arose as a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. 　The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, with the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of having an "astonishing" lack of method and critical-self reflection.

<font size=3>
Resignation is the formal act of leaving or quitting one's office or position. 　A resignation can occur when a person holding a position gained by election or appointment steps down, but leaving a position upon the expiration of a term, or choosing not to seek an additional term, is not considered resignation. 　When an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination. 　Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible. 　Abdication is the equivalent of resignation for a reigning monarch, pope, or holder of another similar position.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii>Hawaii</a> 

<font size=3>
Hawaii (/həˈwaɪi/ (listen) hə-WY-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi] or [həˈwɐjʔi]) is a state in the Western United States, about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland in the Pacific Ocean. 　It is the only U.S. state outside North America, the only state that is an archipelago, and the only state in the tropics. 　Hawaii comprises nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km) that are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. 　The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth-longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210 km). 　The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi—the last of these, after which the state is named, is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. 　The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the United States' largest protected area and the fourth-largest in the world. 　Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the eighth-smallest in land area and the 11th-least populous, but with 1.4 million residents ranks 13th in population density. 　Two-thirds of the population lives on O'ahu, home to the state's capital and largest city, Honolulu. 　Hawaii is among the country's most diverse states, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over two centuries of migration. 　As one of only six majority-minority states, it has the country's only Asian American plurality, its largest Buddhist community, and the largest proportion of multiracial people. 　Consequently, it is a unique melting pot of North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian heritage. 　Settled by Polynesians some time between 1000 and 1200 CE, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms. 　In 1778, British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the archipelago; early British influence is reflected in the state flag, which bears a Union Jack. 　An influx of European and American explorers, traders, and whalers soon arrived, leading to the decimation of the once isolated Indigenous community by introducing diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, leprosy, and typhoid fever, reducing the native Hawaiian population from between 300,000 and one million to less than 40,000 by 1890. 　Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until American and European businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. 　As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II. 　Hawaii is the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959. 　In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. 　Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the U.S. Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid-20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors. 　The state attracts tourists, surfers, and scientists with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island. 　Hawaii hosts the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department. 　Although its relative isolation results in one of the highest costs of living in the United States, Hawaii is the third-wealthiest state.

<font size=3>
A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) was, traditionally, any document written by hand – or, once practical typewriters became available, typewritten – as opposed to mechanically printed or reproduced in some indirect or automated way. 　More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include any written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author's work, as distinguished from the rendition as a printed version of the same. 　Before the arrival of printing, all documents and books were manuscripts. 　Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, music notation, explanatory figures, or illustrations.

<font size=3>
Milan (/mɪˈlæn/ mil-AN, US also /mɪˈlɑːn/ mil-AHN, Lombard: [miˈlãː] (listen); Italian: Milano [miˈlaːno] (listen)) is a city in northern Italy, capital of Lombardy, and the second-most populous city proper in Italy after Rome. 　The city proper has a population of about 1.4 million, while its metropolitan city has 3.26 million inhabitants. 　Its continuously built-up urban area (whose outer suburbs extend well beyond the boundaries of the administrative metropolitan city and even stretch into the nearby country of Switzerland) is the fourth largest in the EU with 5.27 million inhabitants. 　According to national sources, the population within the wider Milan metropolitan area (also known as Greater Milan), is estimated between 8.2 million and 12.5 million making it by far the largest metropolitan area in Italy and one of the largest in the EU. 　Milan is considered a leading alpha global city, with strengths in the fields of art, chemicals, commerce, design, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media (communication), services, research and tourism. 　Its business district hosts Italy's stock exchange (Italian: Borsa Italiana), and the headquarters of national and international banks and companies. 　In terms of GDP, Milan is the wealthiest city in Italy, has the third-largest economy among EU cities after Paris and Madrid, and is the wealthiest among EU non-capital cities. 　Milan is viewed along with Turin as the southernmost part of the Blue Banana urban development corridor (also known as the "European Megalopolis"), and one of the Four Motors for Europe. 　The city's role as a major political centre dates back to the late antiquity, when it served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire, while from the 12th century until the 16th century, Milan was one of the largest European cities, and a major trade and commercial centre, consequently becoming the capital of the Duchy of Milan, which was one of the greatest political, artistic and fashion forces in the Renaissance. 　Despite losing much of its political and cultural importance in the early modern period, the city regained its status as a major economic and political centre, being considered today as the industrial and financial capital of Italy. 　The city has been recognized as one of the world's four fashion capitals (the others being London, New York, and Paris) thanks to several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are among the world's biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. 　It hosted the Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. 　The city hosts numerous cultural institutions, academies and universities, with 11% of the national total of enrolled students. 　Milan received 10 million visitors in 2018, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from China, United States, France and Germany. 　The tourists are attracted by Milan's museums and art galleries that include some of the most important collections in the world, including major works by Leonardo da Vinci. 　The city is served by many luxury hotels and is the fifth-most starred in the world by Michelin Guide. 　Milan is also home to two of Europe's most successful football teams, A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, and one of Europe's main basketball teams, Olimpia Milano. 　Milan will host the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games for the first time in 2026, together with Cortina d'Ampezzo.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta>Alberta</a> 

<font size=3>
Alberta (/ælˈbɜːrtə/ al-BUR-tə) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. 　It is part of Western Canada and is one of the three prairie provinces. 　Alberta is bordered by British Columbia to the west, Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories (NWT) to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the south. 　It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada (Saskatchewan being the other). 　The eastern part of the province is occupied by the Great Plains, while the western part borders the Rocky Mountains. 　The province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity. 　Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional Chinook winds. 　Alberta is the fourth largest province by area at 661,848 square kilometres (255,541 square miles), and the fourth most populous, being home to 4,262,635 people. 　Alberta's capital is Edmonton, while Calgary is its largest city. 　The two are Alberta's largest census metropolitan areas. 　More than half of Albertans live in either Edmonton or Calgary, which contributes to continuing the rivalry between the two cities. 　English is the official language of the province. 　In 2016, 76.0% of Albertans were anglophone, 1.8% were francophone and 22.2% were allophone. 　Alberta's economy is based on hydrocarbons, petrochemical industries, livestock and agriculture. 　The oil and gas industry has been a pillar of Alberta's economy since 1947, when substantial oil deposits were discovered at Leduc No. 1 well. 　It has also become a part of the province's identity. 　Since Alberta is the province most rich in hydrocarbons, it provides 70% of the oil and natural gas exploited on Canadian soil. 　In 2018, Alberta's output was CA$338.2 billion, 15.27% of Canada's GDP. 　In the past, Alberta's political landscape hosted parties like the centre-left Liberals and the agrarian United Farmers of Alberta. 　Today, Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province. 　The right-wing Social Credit Party held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before the centre-right Progressive Conservatives held office continually from 1971 to 2015, the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian history. 　Before becoming part of Canada, Alberta was home to several First Nations like Plains Indians and Woodland Cree. 　It was also a territory used by fur traders of the rival companies Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company. 　The Dominion of Canada bought the lands that would become Alberta as part of the NWT in 1870. 　From the late 1800s to early 1900s, many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the US. 　Growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable. 　In 1905, the Alberta Act was passed, creating the province of Alberta. 　Massive oil reserves were discovered in 1947. 　The exploitation of oil sands began in 1967. 　Alberta is renowned for its natural beauty, richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves. 　Alberta is home to six UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites: the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Dinosaur Provincial Park, Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park. 　Other popular sites include Banff National Park, Elk Island National Park, Jasper National Park, Waterton Lakes National Park, and Drumheller.

<font size=3>
Tau is the name of an evil spirit in Guaraní mythology. 　Although Tau is not quite synonymous with the Devil in Christian beliefs, for example, he was sometimes referred to as The Evil Spirit and as such may have been a personification of evil itself. 　Tau was created along with his opposite, Angatupyry, by the supreme god of the Guaraní creation myth, Tupã, and was left with humanity on Earth.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau>Tau</a> 

<font size=3>
Tau /ˈtɔː, ˈtaʊ/ (uppercase Τ, lowercase τ, or τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} ; Greek: ταυ [taf]) is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless dental or alveolar plosive IPA: [t]. 　In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 300. 　The name in English is pronounced /taʊ/ or /tɔː/, but in Greek it is [taf]. 　This is because the pronunciation of the combination of Greek letters αυ can have the pronunciation of either [ai], [av] or [af], depending on what follows and if a diaeresis is present on the second vowel (see Greek orthography). 　Tau was derived from the Phoenician letter taw (𐤕). 　Letters that arose from tau include Roman T and Cyrillic Te (Т, т). 　The letter occupies the Unicode slots U+03C4 (lowercase) and U+03A4 (uppercase). 　In HTML, they can be produced with named entities (&tau; and &Tau;), decimal references (&#964; and &#932;), or hexadecimal references (&#x3C4; and &#x3A4;).

<font size=3>
Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. 　Marble is typically not foliated (layered), although there are exceptions. 　In geology, the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone. 　Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.
