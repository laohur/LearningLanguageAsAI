<font size=3>
A girl is a young female human, usually a child or an adolescent. 　When a girl becomes an adult, she is accurately described as a woman. 　However, the term girl is also used for other meanings, including young woman, and is sometimes used as a synonym for daughter, or girlfriend.　[citation needed] In certain contexts, the usage of girl for a woman may be derogatory. 　Girl may also be a term of endearment used by an adult, usually a woman, to designate adult female friends. 　Girl also appears in portmanteaus (compound words) like showgirl, cowgirl, and schoolgirl. 　The treatment and status of girls in any society is usually closely related to the status of women in that culture. 　In cultures where women have a low societal position, girls may be unwanted by their parents, and the state may invest less in services for girls. 　Girls' upbringing ranges from being relatively the same as that of boys to complete sex segregation and completely different gender roles.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood>Blood</a> 
<font size=3>
Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. 　Blood in the circulatory system is also known as peripheral blood, and the blood cells it carries, peripheral blood cells. 　Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. 　Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. 　Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.　[citation needed] The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes), and in mammals platelets (also called thrombocytes). 　The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. 　These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas thereby increasing its solubility in blood. 　In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma. 　Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. 　Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. 　Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. 　In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen. 　Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. 　White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. 　Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. 　Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system. 　Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. 　In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. 　Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo-, hemato-, haemo- or haemato- from the Greek word αἷμα (haima) for "blood". 　In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean>Mean</a> 
<font size=3>
There are several kinds of mean in mathematics, especially in statistics. 　Each mean serves to summarize a given group of data, often to better understand the overall value (magnitude and sign) of a given data set. 　For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also known as "arithmetic average", is a measure of central tendency of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. 　The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar, x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} . 　If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean ( x ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} ) to distinguish it from the mean, or expected value, of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted μ {\displaystyle \mu } or μ x {\displaystyle \mu _{x}} ). 　Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self>Self</a> 
<font size=3>
The self is an individual as the object of that individual’s own reflective consciousness. 　Since the self is a reference by a subject to the same subject, this reference is necessarily subjective. 　The sense of having a self—or selfhood—should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself. 　Ostensibly, this sense is directed outward from the subject to refer inward, back to its "self" (or itself). 　Examples of psychiatric conditions where such "sameness" may become broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occurs in schizophrenia: the self appears different from the subject. 　The first-person perspective distinguishes selfhood from personal identity. 　Whereas "identity" is (literally) sameness and may involve categorization and labeling, selfhood implies a first-person perspective and suggests potential uniqueness. 　Conversely, we use "person" as a third-person reference. 　Personal identity can be impaired in late-stage Alzheimer's disease and in other neurodegenerative diseases. 　Finally, the self is distinguishable from "others". 　Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience. 　Although subjective experience is central to selfhood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the Philosophy of self and scientific study of consciousness.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue>Blue</a> 
<font size=3>
Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model. 　It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. 　The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 　Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. 　The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. 　An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. 　Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective. 　Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. 　The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. 　In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. 　In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. 　Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. 　In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. 　Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. 　Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union. 　Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. 　In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. 　The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm, and concentration.

<font size=3>
A daughter is a female offspring; a girl or a woman in relation to her parents. 　Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter. 　The male counterpart is a son. 　Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements. 　From biological perspective, a daughter is a first degree relative. 　The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity. 　It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder. 　In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. 　A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide. 　In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price. 　The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman and is known as a dowry. 　The payment of a dowry can be found in societies where women do not labour outside the home.

Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. 　Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. 　The history of social conflicts has often involved attempts to define and redefine rights. 　According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake>Lake</a> 
<font size=3>
A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water localized in a basin surrounded by land, with much slower-moving flow than any inflow or outflow streams that serve to feed or drain the lake. 　Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing water reservoirs. 　Most lakes are freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater. 　Lakes are typically much larger and deeper than ponds, which also water-filled basins on land, although there are no official definitions or scientific criteria distinguishing the two. 　Most lakes are both fed and drained by creeks and rivers, but some lakes are endorheic without any outflowing drainage, while volcanic lakes are filled directly by precipitation runoffs and do not have any inflow streams. 　Lakes are also distinct from lagoons, which are shallow tidal pools dammed by sandbars at coastal regions. 　Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas (i.e. alpine lakes), dormant volcanic craters, rift zones and areas with ongoing glaciation. 　Other lakes are found in depressed landforms or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened over a basin formed by eroded floodplains and wetlands. 　Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age. 　All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them. 　Artificially controlled lakes are known as reservoirs, and are usually constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydroelectric power generation, for supplying domestic drinking water, for ecological or recreational purposes, or for other human activities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future>Future</a> 
<font size=3>
The future is the time after the past and present. 　Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics. 　Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end. 　In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur. 　In special relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future light cone. 　In the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal. 　Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. 　Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future. 　Future studies, or futurology, is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures. 　Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures. 　Predeterminism is the belief that the past, present, and future have been already decided. 　The concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including art movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement futurism.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)>Function (biology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In evolutionary biology, function is the reason some object or process occurred in a system that evolved through natural selection. 　That reason is typically that it achieves some result, such as that chlorophyll helps to capture the energy of sunlight in photosynthesis. 　Hence, the organism that contains it is more likely to survive and reproduce, in other words the function increases the organism's fitness. 　A characteristic that assists in evolution is called an adaptation; other characteristics may be non-functional spandrels, though these in turn may later be co-opted by evolution to serve new functions. 　In biology, function has been defined in many ways. 　In physiology, it is simply what an organ, tissue, cell or molecule does. 　In the philosophy of biology, talk of function inevitably suggests some kind of teleological purpose, even though natural selection operates without any goal for the future. 　All the same, biologists often use teleological language as a shorthand for function. 　In contemporary philosophy of biology, there are three major accounts of function in the biological world: theories of causal role, selected effect, and goal contribution.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular>Particular</a> 
<font size=3>
In metaphysics, particulars or individuals are usually contrasted with universals. 　Universals concern features that can be exemplified by various different particulars. 　Particulars are often seen as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers. 　There are, however, theories of abstract particulars or tropes. 　For example, Socrates is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars). 　Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (for example a bicycle, an apple, and a given woman's hair can all be red). 　In nominalist view everything is particular. 　Universals in each moment of time from point of view of an observer is the collection of particulars that participates it (even a void collection).

<font size=3>
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. 　The primary functions which distinguish money are as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. 　Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possess intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. 　Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private", in the case of the United States dollar. 　The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). 　Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.

<font size=3>
A style, sometimes referred to as a crystalline style (though there are no other biological kinds), is a rod made of glycoprotein located in the midgut of most bivalves and some gastropods which aids in extracellular digestion. 　It consists of a protein matrix coated with digestive enzymes secreted by the style sac in the animal's stomach. 　When feeding, its projecting end is scraped against the stomach wall and abraded, thus releasing the enzymes. 　When subjected to starvation or desiccation, some bivalves have been known to re-ingest this organ.

<font size=3>
In typography, leading (/ˈlɛdɪŋ/ LED-ing) is the space between adjacent lines of type; the exact definition varies. 　In hand typesetting, leading is the thin strips of lead (or aluminium) that were inserted between lines of type in the composing stick to increase the vertical distance between them. 　The thickness of the strip is called leading and is equal to the difference between the size of the type and the distance from one baseline to the next. 　For instance, given a type size of 10 points and a distance between baselines of 12 points, the leading would be 2 points. 　The term is still used in modern page-layout software such as QuarkXPress, the Affinity Suite, and Adobe InDesign. 　Consumer-oriented word-processing software often talks of line spacing or, more accurately, interline spacing.
