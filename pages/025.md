<font size=3>
Produce is a generalized term for many farm-produced crops, including fruits and vegetables (grains, oats, etc. are also sometimes considered produce). 　More specifically, the term produce often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were harvested.　[citation needed] In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept. 　Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets. 　The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries. 　In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes. 　These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop>Bishop</a> 
<font size=3>
A bishop is an ordained clergy member who is entrusted with a position of authority and oversight in a religious institution. 　In Christianity, bishops are normally responsible for the governance of dioceses. 　The role or office of bishop is called episcopacy. 　Organizationally, several Christian denominations utilize ecclesiastical structures that call for the position of bishops, while other denominations have dispensed with this office, seeing it as a symbol of power. 　Bishops have also exercised political authority. 　Traditionally, bishops claim apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles or Saint Paul. 　The bishops are by doctrine understood as those who possess the full priesthood given by Jesus Christ, and therefore may ordain other clergy, including other bishops. 　A person ordained as a deacon, priest (i.e. presbyter), and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ministerial priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the Body of Christ (the Church). 　Priests, deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry. 　Some Pentecostal and other Protestant denominations have bishops who oversee congregations, though they do not claim apostolic succession.

<font size=3>
A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. 　A judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. 　A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court. 　The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. 　In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. 　In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. 　The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection>Protection</a> 
<font size=3>
Protection is any measure taken to guard a thing against damage caused by outside forces. 　Protection can be provided to physical objects, including organisms, to systems, and to intangible things like civil and political rights. 　Although the mechanisms for providing protection vary widely, the basic meaning of the term remains the same. 　This is illustrated by an explanation found in a manual on electrical wiring: The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use. 　People protect themselves against personal or financial loss by means of insurance and from injury or discomfort by the use of protective clothing. 　They further protect their property by the installation of security measures such as locks and/or alarm systems. 　Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light. 　Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss. 　Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations. 　Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm. 　Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements. 　Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators. 　In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems. 　Humans seek to protect locations of historical and cultural significance through historic preservation efforts, and are also concerned with protecting the environment from damage caused by human activity, and with protecting the Earth as a whole from potentially harmful objects from space.

<font size=3>
A highway is any public or private road or other public way on land. 　It is used for major roads, but also includes other public roads and public tracks. 　In some areas of the United States, it is used as an equivalent term to controlled-access highway, or a translation for autobahn, autoroute, etc. 　According to Merriam Webster, the use of the term predates the 12th century. 　According to Etymonline, "high" is in the sense of "main". 　In North American and Australian English, major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways). 　Other roads may be designated "county highways" in the US and Ontario. 　These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway. 　In British English, "highway" is primarily a legal term. 　Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc. 　The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, highway patrol and highwayman.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida>Florida</a> 
<font size=3>
Florida is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico; Alabama to the northwest; Georgia to the north; the Bahamas and Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. 　It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　Spanning 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), Florida ranks 22nd in area among the 50 states, and with a population of over 21 million, it is the third-most populous. 　Florida's largest metro area is the Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, though its single largest city proper is Jacksonville. 　Florida's other large population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee. 　Various Native American groups have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. 　In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). 　Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. 　Florida was repeatedly contested by Spain and Great Britain before being ceded to the U.S. in 1819; it was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. 　Florida was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. 　The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868. 　Since the mid-20th century, Florida has experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. 　Its economy, with a gross state product (GSP) of $1.0 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation. 　Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of visitors annually. 　Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. 　The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. 　Florida has attracted or inspired writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway, and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, particularly in golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports. 　Florida was also heavily noted for being a battleground state in American presidential elections, particularly those in 2000, 2016, and 2020. 　About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. 　It has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier islands. 　Florida has 4,510 islands that are ten acres (4.0 hectares) or larger in area, the second highest number after Alaska. 　Much of the state is at or near sea level, and is characterized by sedimentary soil. 　Florida is the flattest state in the country, with the lowest high point of any U.S. state, at just 345 feet (105 meters). 　Florida's largest freshwater lake, Lake Okeechobee, is the second-largest located entirely within the contiguous 48 states and often referred to as an inland sea. 　Several beaches in Florida have turquoise and emerald-colored coastal waters. 　Florida's climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. 　It is the only state besides Hawaii to have a tropical climate, and is the only continental state with both a tropical climate (at the lower tip of the peninsula) and a coral reef. 　Consequently, Florida has several unique ecosystems, most notably Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the Americas. 　Unique wildlife include the American alligator, American crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther, bottlenose dolphin, and manatee. 　The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world after the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef.

A border divides two or more geographical boundaries, imposed either by features such as oceans and terrain, or by political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. 　Political borders can be established through warfare, colonization, or mutual agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation. 　Some borders—such as most states' internal administrative borders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area—are open and completely unguarded. 　Most external political borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints; adjacent border zones may also be controlled. 　Buffer zones may be set up on borders between belligerent entities to lower the risk of escalation. 　While border refers to the boundary itself, the area around the border is called the frontier.

<font size=3>
In biology and medicine, a host is a larger organism that harbours a smaller organism; whether a parasitic, a mutualistic, or a commensalist guest (symbiont). 　The guest is typically provided with nourishment and shelter. 　Examples include animals playing host to parasitic worms (e.g. nematodes), cells harbouring pathogenic (disease-causing) viruses, a bean plant hosting mutualistic (helpful) nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 　More specifically in botany, a host plant supplies food resources to micropredators, which have an evolutionarily stable relationship with their hosts similar to ectoparasitism. 　The host range is the collection of hosts that an organism can use as a partner.

In psychology and mental health, the host is the most prominent personality, state, or identity in someone who has dissociative identity disorder (DID) (formerly known as multiple personality disorder). 　The other personalities, besides the host, are known as alter personalities, or just "alters". 　The host may or may not be the original personality, which is the personality a person is born with. 　Additionally, the host may or may not be the personality that coincides with the official legal name of the person. 　Often this is thought to be the root of the person's psyche, or at least a key figure for completion of therapy, whether or not it has integration of the host and alters as a goal. 　There are arguments that a person can have multiple hosts.

Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, the Celtic Sea to the south west and the Bristol Channel to the south. 　It had a population in 2021 of 3,107,500 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi). 　Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit. 　The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. 　The capital and largest city is Cardiff. 　Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was formed as a kingdom under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. 　Wales is regarded as one of the Celtic nations. 　After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glyndŵr led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (Welsh: senedd). 　In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. 　Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. 　Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. 　Welsh national feeling grew over the century; a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. 　A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters. 　At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. 　Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys. 　The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. 　The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. 　Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism. 　Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency. 　The country has a distinct national and cultural identity and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the "land of song", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition and rousing choir singing. 　Both Welsh and English are official languages. 　A majority of the population in most areas speaks English whilst a majority of the population in parts of the north and west speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the whole country.

<font size=3>
Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. 　It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. 　Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.　[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. 　It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. 　Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber. 　Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. 　More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate. 　As of 2020, the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 557 billion cubic meters. 　As an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. 　In 2008, approximately 3.97 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. 　Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.

<font size=3>
A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. 　A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms a sign of disease. 　A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. 　The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these. 　The philosophical study of signs and symbols is called semiotics; this includes the study of semiosis, which is the way in which signs (in the semiotic sense) operate.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation>Nation</a> 
<font size=3>
A nation is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or society. 　A nation is thus the collective identity of a group of people understood as defined by those features. 　Some nations are equated with ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are equated with affiliation to a social and political constitution (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism). 　A nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. 　A nation has also been defined as a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity and particular interests. 　The consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed and historically contingent. 　Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism – the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state – did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century. 　There are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. 　Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. 　Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. 　Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible. 　Proponents of modernization theory describe nations as "imagined communities", a term coined by Benedict Anderson. 　A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. 　For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. 　Nationalism is consequently seen an "invented tradition" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. 　A nation's foundational "story" may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat>Heat</a> 
<font size=3>
In thermodynamics, heat is defined as the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across the boundary. 　A thermodynamic system does not contain heat. 　Nevertheless, the term is also often used to refer to the thermal energy contained in a system as a component of its internal energy and that is reflected in the temperature of the system. 　For both uses of the term, heat is a form of energy. 　An example of formal vs. informal usage may be obtained from the right-hand photo, in which the metal bar is "conducting heat" from its hot end to its cold end, but if the metal bar is considered a thermodynamic system, then the energy flowing within the metal bar is called internal energy, not heat. 　The hot metal bar is also transferring heat to its surroundings, a correct statement for both the strict and loose meanings of heat. 　Another example of informal usage is the term heat content, used despite the fact that physics defines heat as energy transfer. 　More accurately, it is thermal energy that is contained in the system or body, as it is stored in the microscopic degrees of freedom of the modes of vibration. 　Heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by a mechanism that involves the microscopic atomic modes of motion or the corresponding macroscopic properties. 　This descriptive characterization excludes the transfers of energy by thermodynamic work or mass transfer. 　Defined quantitatively, the heat involved in a process is the difference in internal energy between the final and initial states of a system, and subtracting the work done in the process. 　This is the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. 　The measurement of energy transferred as heat is called calorimetry, performed by measuring its effect on the states of interacting bodies. 　For example, heat can be measured by the amount of ice melted, or by change in temperature of a body in the surroundings of the system. 　In the International System of Units (SI) the unit of measurement for heat, as a form of energy, is the joule (J).

<font size=3>
Political "spring" is a term popularized in the late twentieth century to refer to any of a number of student protests, revolutionary political movements or revolutionary waves. 　It originated in the European Revolutions of 1848, which was sometimes referred to as the "Spring of Nations" or "Springtime of the Peoples". 　Prague Spring, a period of political liberalization of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1968 Croatian Spring, a 1971 movement for Croatian language rights and cultural identity in the second Yugoslavia Beijing Spring, a period of political liberalization in the People's Republic of China in the late 1970s Seoul Spring, a period of democratization in South Korea in the late 1970s and early 1980s Rangoon Spring, sometimes used to describe the period leading up to the August 8, 1988 "8888" Uprising Kathmandu Spring, sometimes used to describe the 1990 People's Movement in Nepal, as well as subsequent democratic movements. 　Tehran Spring, sometimes used to describe the period in Iran during the 1997–2005 presidency of Mohammad Khatami Damascus Spring, period in Syria following the death of Hafez al-Assad in 2001 Cedar Spring was a chain of demonstrations in Lebanon (especially in the capital Beirut) triggered by the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005. 　Harare Spring, sometimes used to describe the period in Zimbabwe after the 2008 power sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai Arab Spring, another term for the Middle East—North Africa protest of 2010–2014 Riyadh Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests. 　The 2012 Quebec student protests movement is also called the 'Maple' Spring, from the French "Printemps Érable" which sounds phonetically similar to "Printemps Arabe" (Arab Spring). 　"Printemps Québécois" for "Quebec Spring" is also used. 　The 2012 Valencia student protests, also called Valencian Spring [es; ca]. 　In February 2012 the students of the Lluís Vives High school participated in several demonstrations to protest against the cutbacks in the educational budgets of the Valencian Autonomous Community. 　The police’s performance in those demonstrations was extremely controversial and appeared in many international media. 　This sparked the interest of Parents Associations and both Student and International organisations, such as Amnesty International and Save the Children. 　The documentary Spanish Teen Rally collect the testimony of Valencian Spring's students. 　Venezuelan Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2014 Venezuelan protests. 　Russian Spring, sometimes used to describe the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. 　Latin American spring, sometimes used to describe mass protest events that took place in Latin America between 2019 and 2022.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)>Spring (hydrology)</a> 
<font size=3>
A spring is a natural exit point at which groundwater emerges out of the aquifer and flows onto the top of the Earth's crust (pedosphere) to become surface water. 　It is a component of the hydrosphere as well as a part of the water cycle. 　Springs have long been important for humans as a source of fresh water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall. 　Springs are driven out onto the surface by various natural forces, such as gravity and hydrostatic pressure. 　A spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater is known as a hot spring. 　The yield of spring water varies widely from a volumetric flow rate of nearly zero to more than 14,000 litres per second (490 cu ft/s) for the biggest springs.

A prize is an award to be given to a person or a group of people (such as sporting teams and organizations) to recognize and reward their actions and achievements. 　Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. 　Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Academy Awards. 　Prizes are also given to publicize noteworthy or exemplary behaviour, and to provide incentives for improved outcomes and competitive efforts. 　In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. 　However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy. 　Specific types of prizes include: Booby prize: typically awarded as a joke or insult to whoever finished last (e.g., wooden spoon award). 　Consolation prize: an award given to those who do not win but are deemed worthy of recognition. 　Hierarchical prizes, where the best award is "first prize", "grand prize", or "gold medal". 　Subordinate awards are "second prize", "third prize", etc., or "first runner-up" and "second runner-up", etc., or "silver medal" and "bronze medal". 　(In some contests, "grand prize" is more desirable than "first prize".) 　On game shows in the UK, the term is "star prize", while in Australia, it is "major prize". 　Purchase prize or acquisition prize: a monetary prize given in an art competition in exchange for the winning work. 　Winnings from an inducement prize contest, usually a reward for accomplishing a specific feat of use to the sponsor or society at large
