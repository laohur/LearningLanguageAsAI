Athens (/ˈæθɪnz/ ATH-inz; Greek: Αθήνα, romanized: Athína [aˈθina] (listen); Ancient Greek: Ἀθῆναι, romanized: Athênai (pl.) [atʰɛ̂ːnai̯]) is a coastal city in the Mediterranean and is both the capital and largest city of Greece. 　With a population close to four million, it is also the seventh largest city in the European Union. 　Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. 　Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. 　It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. 　It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political influence on the European continent—particularly Ancient Rome. 　In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. 　In 2021, Athens' urban area hosted more than three and a half million people, which is around 35% of the entire population of Greece.　[citation needed] Athens is a Beta-status global city according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and is one of the biggest economic centers in Southeastern Europe. 　It also has a large financial sector, and its port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe, and the third largest in the world. 　The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which actually constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire city, had a population of 637,798 (in 2021) within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi). 　The Athens Metropolitan Area or Greater Athens extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,722,544 (in 2021) over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi). 　Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland and the warmest major city in continental Europe with an average annual temperature of up to 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) locally. 　The heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments, and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. 　The city also retains Roman, Byzantine and a smaller number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. 　Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. 　Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament and the so-called "Architectural Trilogy of Athens", consisting of the National Library of Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and the Academy of Athens. 　Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art, the Benaki Museum, and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. 　Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics, making it one of the few cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once. 　Athens joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility>Utility</a> 
<font size=3>
As a topic of economics, utility is used to model worth or value. 　Its usage has evolved significantly over time. 　The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness as part of the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. 　The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a single consumer's preference ordering over a choice set but is not comparable across consumers. 　This concept of utility is personal and based on choice rather than on pleasure received, and so is specified more rigorously than the original concept but makes it less useful (and controversial) for ethical decisions.

An arch is a vertical curved structure that spans an elevated space and may or may not support the weight above it, or in case of a horizontal arch like an arch dam, the hydrostatic pressure against it. 　Arches may be synonymous with vaults, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. 　Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the ancient Romans, who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake>Earthquake</a> 
<font size=3>
An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. 　Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. 　The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period. 　The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. 　The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. 　At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. 　When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. 　Earthquakes can also trigger landslides. 　In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. 　Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. 　An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. 　The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia>Militia</a> 
<font size=3>
A militia (/mɪˈlɪʃə/) is generally an army or some other fighting organization of non-professional soldiers, citizens of a country, or subjects of a state, who may perform military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel; or, historically, to members of a warrior-nobility class (e.g. knights or samurai). 　Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces, militias commonly support regular troops by skirmishing, holding fortifications, or conducting irregular warfare, instead of undertaking offensive campaigns by themselves. 　Local civilian laws often limit militias to serve only in their home region, and to serve only for a limited time; this further reduces their use in long military campaigns. 　Beginning in the late 20th century, some militias (in particular officially recognized and sanctioned militias of a government) act as professional forces, while still being "part-time" or "on-call" organizations. 　For instance, the members of United States National Guard units are considered professional soldiers, as they are trained to the same standards as their "full-time" (active duty) counterparts are. 　Militias thus can be either military or paramilitary, depending on the instance. 　Some of the contexts in which the term "militia" can apply include: forces engaged in a defense activity or service, to protect a community, its territory, property, and laws, the entire able-bodied population of a community, town, county, or state available to be called to arms a subset of these who may be legally penalized for failing to respond to a call-up a subset of these who actually respond to a call-up regardless of legal obligation a private (non-governmental) force not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by a government an irregular armed force that enables its leader to exercise military, economic, or political control over a subnational territory within a sovereign state in Russia and some countries of the former Soviet Union, an official reserve army composed of citizen soldiers known as the militsiya or militia (police) a select militia composed of a small, non-representative portion of the population, maritime militias composed of fishermen and other participants of the marine industry which are organized and sanctioned by a state to enforce its maritime boundaries.

<font size=3>
A stranger is a person who is unknown to another person or group. 　Because of this unknown status, a stranger may be perceived as a threat until their identity and character can be ascertained. 　Different classes of strangers have been identified for social science purposes, and the tendency for strangers and foreigners to overlap has been examined. 　The presence of a stranger can throw an established social order into question, "because the stranger is neither friend nor enemy; and because he may be both". 　The distrust of strangers has led to the concept of stranger danger (and the expression "don't talk to strangers"), wherein excessive emphasis is given to teaching children to fear strangers despite the most common sources of abduction or abuse being people known to the child.

<font size=3>
The playoffs, play-offs, postseason or finals of a sports league are a competition played after the regular season by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade. 　Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a tournament, and may use a single-elimination system or one of several other different playoff formats. 　Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament. 　In team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. 　Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league's best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. 　Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. 　Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams – the term "wild card" refers to these teams. 　In England and Scotland, playoffs are used in association football to decide promotion for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. 　In the EFL Championship (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the final promotion spot to the Premier League.

<font size=3>
Chess is a board game between two players. 　It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). 　The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. 　Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide. 　Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. 　It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 　At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. 　The player controlling the white pieces moves first, followed by the player controlling the black pieces. 　The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. 　There are also several ways a game can end in a draw. 　Organized chess arose in the 19th century. 　Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). 　The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. 　A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. 　Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art, and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology. 　One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. 　In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. 　Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory. 　This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance>Renaissance</a> 
<font size=3>
The Renaissance (UK: /rɪˈneɪsəns/ rin-AY-sənss, US: /ˈrɛnəsɑːns/ (listen) REN-ə-sahnss) is a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries, characterized by an effort to revive and surpass ideas and achievements of classical antiquity. 　It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. 　In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a "long Renaissance" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century. 　The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages. 　However, the beginnings of the period – the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300 – overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c. 　1250–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; and as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either. 　The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "man is the measure of all things". 　This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science, and literature. 　Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. 　Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto. 　As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. 　In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. 　Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance man". 　The Renaissance began in Florence, one of the many states of Italy. 　Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. 　Other major centers were Venice, Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. 　From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe in Flanders, France, Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Poland, Hungary (with Beatrice of Naples), and elsewhere. 　The Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual cultural heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. 　Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, "by a thousand ties". 　The term rinascita ('rebirth') first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists (c. 1550), anglicized as the Renaissance in the 1830s. 　The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), Ottonian Renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the Renaissance of the 12th century.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep>Sheep</a> 
<font size=3>
Sheep or domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are domesticated, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. 　Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. 　Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. 　Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. 　An adult female is referred to as a ewe (/juː/), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb. 　Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia, with Iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center. 　One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. 　A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. 　In Commonwealth countries, ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones; in the United States, meat from both older and younger animals is usually called lamb. 　Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science. 　Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. 　In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production. 　There is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect. 　Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. 　A group of sheep is called a flock. 　Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age. 　Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. 　As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. 　Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. 　In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.

<font size=3>
An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell (a zygote) and to incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. 　Most arthropods such as insects, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not. 　Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. 　Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. 　When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell. 　Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering. 　The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm × 14 cm × 9 cm (11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in) in size. 　Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother. 　At 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) and up to 17.8 cm × 14 cm (7.0 in × 5.5 in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird,: 130  though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs. 　The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which measures between 6.35–11.4 millimetres (0.250–0.449 in) long and weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz).　: 132  Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller. 　Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed "spores," or in spermatophytes "seeds," or in gametophytes "egg cells".

<font size=3>
In topology, a branch of mathematics, the suspension of a topological space X is intuitively obtained by stretching X into a cylinder and then collapsing both end faces to points. 　One views X as "suspended" between these end points. 　The suspension of X is denoted by SX or susp(X).　: 76  There is a variation of the suspension for pointed space, which is called the reduced suspension and denoted by ΣX. 　The "usual" suspension SX is sometimes called the unreduced suspension, unbased suspension, or free suspension of X, to distinguish it from ΣX.

Derby (/ˈdɑːrbi/ (listen) DAR-bee) is a city and unitary authority area in Derbyshire, England. 　It lies on the banks of the River Derwent in the south of Derbyshire, which is in the East Midlands Region. 　It was traditionally the county town of Derbyshire. 　Derby gained city status in 1977. 　The last decade has seen the population increase by 5.1%, from around 248,800 in 2011 to 261,400 in 2021. 　Derby was settled by Romans, who established the town of Derventio, later captured by the Anglo-Saxons, and later still by the Vikings, who made their town of Djúra-bý one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. 　Initially a market town, Derby grew rapidly in the industrial era. 　Home to Lombe's Mill, an early British factory, Derby has a claim to be one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution.　[citation needed] It contains the southern part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. 　With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Derby became a centre of the British rail industry. 　Derby is a centre for advanced transport manufacturing, being home to the world's second largest aero-engine manufacturer: Rolls-Royce. 　Bombardier Transportation has a production facility at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works while Toyota Manufacturing UK's automobile headquarters is located southwest of the city at Burnaston.

<font size=3>
A parade is a procession of people, usually organized along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by marching bands, floats, or sometimes large balloons. 　Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually celebrations of some kind. 　In British English, the term "parade" is usually reserved for either military parades or other occasions where participants march in formation; for celebratory occasions, the word procession is more usual.　[citation needed] The term "parade" may also be used for multiple different subjects; for example, in the Canadian Armed Forces, "parade" is used both to describe the procession and in other informal connotations. 　Protest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but such cases are usually referred to as a march instead.

<font size=3>
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only than Mercury. 　In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. 　Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. 　Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. 　Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. 　Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest-known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. 　The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature. 　Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. 　Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth. 　Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. 　In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. 　It is not known whether life has ever existed on Mars. 　Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. 　NASA's Viking 1 lander transmitted the first images from the Martian surface in 1976. 　Two countries have successfully deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with Zhurong in 2021. 　There are also planned future missions to Mars, such as a NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return set to happen in 2026, and the Rosalind Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch in 2018 but was delayed to 2024 at the earliest, with a more likely launch date at 2028. 　Mars can be viewed from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. 　This appearance, due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars often being called the Red Planet. 　It is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude that reaches −2.94, comparable to that of Jupiter and surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun. 　Mars has been observed since ancient times. 　Over the millennia has been featured in culture and the arts in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.

<font size=3>
In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars (Latin: Mārs, pronounced [maːrs]) was the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. 　He was the son of Jupiter and Juno, and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods. 　Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming. 　Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares, whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. 　The character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature. 　Mars's altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome; in Republican times it was a focus of electoral activities. 　Augustus shifted the focus of Mars' cult to within the pomerium (Rome's ritual boundary), and built a temple to Mars Ultor as a key religious feature of his new forum. 　Unlike Ares, who was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father (pater) of the Roman people. 　In Rome's mythic genealogy and founding, Mars fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia. 　His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, celebrated as the Trojan refugee who "founded" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar>Grammar</a> 
<font size=3>
In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words. 　The term can also refer to the study of such constraints, a field that includes domains such as phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. 　There are currently two different approaches to the study of grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar. 　Fluent speakers of a language variety or lect have effectively internalized these constraints, the vast majority of which – at least in the case of one's native language(s) – are acquired not by conscious study or instruction but by hearing other speakers. 　Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more explicit instruction. 　In this view, grammar is understood as the cognitive information underlying a specific instance of language production. 　The term "grammar" can also describe the linguistic behavior of groups of speakers and writers rather than individuals. 　Differences in scales are important to this sense of the word: for example, the term "English grammar" could refer to the whole of English grammar (that is, to the grammar of all the speakers of the language), in which case the term encompasses a great deal of variation. 　At a smaller scale, it may refer only to what is shared among the grammars of all or most English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). 　At the smallest scale, this sense of "grammar" can describe the conventions of just one relatively well-defined form of English (such as standard English for a region). 　A description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as grammar. 　A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a "reference grammar" or simply "a grammar" (see History of English grammars). 　A fully explicit grammar, which exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech variety, is called descriptive grammar. 　This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to actively discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions while codifying and promoting others, either in an absolute sense or about a standard variety. 　For example, some prescriptivists maintain that sentences in English should not end with prepositions, a prohibition that has been traced to John Dryden (13 April 1668 – January 1688) whose unexplained objection to the practice perhaps led other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use. 　Yet preposition stranding has a long history in Germanic languages like English, where it is so widespread as to be a standard usage. 　Outside linguistics, the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. 　It may be used more broadly to include conventions of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider as part of grammar but rather as part of orthography, the conventions used for writing a language. 　It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding those aspects of a language's grammar which are not subject to variation or debate on their normative acceptability. 　Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to."

<font size=3>
A mosque (/mɒsk/ MOSK) or masjid (/ˈmæsdʒɪd, ˈmʌs-/ MASS-jid, MUSS-; both from Arabic: مَسْجِد, romanized: masjid, pronounced [ˈmasdʒid]; lit. 'place of ritual prostration') is a place of prayer for Muslims. 　Mosques are usually covered buildings, but can be any place where prayers (sujud) are performed, including outdoor courtyards. 　The first mosques were simple places of prayer for Muslims, and may have been open spaces rather than buildings. 　In the first stage of Islamic architecture, 650-750 CE, early mosques comprised open and closed covered spaces enclosed by walls, often with minarets from which calls to prayer were issued. 　Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche (mihrab) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca (qiblah) and ablution facilities. 　The pulpit (minbar), from which the Friday (jumu'ah) sermon (khutba) is delivered, was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques. 　Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women. 　This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period and denomination. 　Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer, Ramadan vigils, funeral services, marriage and business agreements, alms collection and distribution, as well as homeless shelters. 　Historically, mosques have served as a community center, a court of law, and a religious school. 　In modern times, they have also preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate. 　Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca (centre of the hajj), the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (burial place of Muhammad) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (believed to be the site of Muhammad's ascent to heaven). 　With the spread of Islam, mosques multiplied across the Islamic world. 　Sometimes churches and temples were converted into mosques, which influenced Islamic architectural styles. 　While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments, increasing government regulation of large mosques has been countered by a rise of privately funded mosques, many of which serve as bases for different Islamic revivalist currents and social activism. 　Mosques have played a number of political roles. 　The rates of mosque attendance vary widely depending on the region.

Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on the interaction of events, facts, ideas, and people that are the "news of the day" and that informs society to at least some degree of accuracy. 　The word, a noun, applies to the occupation (professional or not), the methods of gathering information, and the organizing literary styles. 　The appropriate role for journalism varies from countries to country, as do perceptions of the profession, and the resulting status. 　In some nations, the news media are controlled by government and are not independent. 　In others, news media are independent of the government and operate as private industry. 　In addition, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech, freedom of the press as well as slander and libel cases. 　The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. 　This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers, magazines, or television news channels. 　News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. 　Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.
