## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics>Statistics</a> 
<font size=3>
Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. "description of a state, a country") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. 　In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. 　Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 　Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. 　When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. 　Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. 　An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. 　In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. 　Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). 　Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. 　Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena. 　A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. 　A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. 　Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. 　Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving a "false negative"). 　Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. 　Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. 　Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. 　The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

<font size=3>
Melbourne (/ˈmɛlbərn/ (listen) MEL-bərn; Boonwurrung/Woiwurrung: Narrm or Naarm) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. 　Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2 (3,858 sq mi) metropolitan area known as Greater Melbourne, comprising an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used specifically for the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area. 　The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley, the Dandenong and Macedon Ranges. 　It has a population over 5 million (19% of the population of Australia, as per 2021 census), mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its inhabitants are commonly referred to as "Melburnians". 　The area of Melbourne has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans. 　Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land encompassing Melbourne are the Boonwurrung, Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples. 　A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip, then part of the British colony of New South Wales, in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), that Melbourne was founded. 　It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837, and named after the then British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. 　In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria. 　During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises. 　After the federation of Australia in 1901, it served as the interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927. 　Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 32nd globally in the March 2022 Global Financial Centres Index. 　Melbourne is home to many of Australia's best-known landmarks, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. 　Noted for its cultural heritage, the city gave rise to Australian rules football, Australian impressionism and Australian cinema, and has more recently been recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre. 　It hosts major annual international events, such as the Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open, and also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics. 　Melbourne consistently ranked as the world's most liveable city for much of the 2010s. 　Melbourne Airport, also known as the Tullamarine Airport, is the second-busiest airport in Australia, and the Port of Melbourne is the nation's busiest seaport. 　Its main metropolitan rail terminus is Flinders Street station and its main regional rail and road coach terminus is Southern Cross station. 　It also has Australia's most extensive freeway network and the largest urban tram network in the world.

<font size=3>
An experiment is a procedure carried out to support or refute a hypothesis, or determine the efficacy or likelihood of something previously untried. 　Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. 　Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. 　There also exist natural experimental studies. 　A child may carry out basic experiments to understand how things fall to the ground, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. 　Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. 　Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time. 　Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). 　Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences. 　Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. 　This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. 　Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. 　Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. 　In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variables.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank>Tank</a> 
<font size=3>
A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. 　Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. 　They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. 　Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. 　They have heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. 　The use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. 　These features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against heavier weapons, although anti-tank weapons used in 2022, some of them man-portable, have demonstrated the ability to destroy older generations of tanks with single shots),[disputed – discuss] all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. 　Fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armoured warfare. 　Until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-, cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks). 　Some being larger and very heavily armoured and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armoured, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. 　These smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. 　The smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily armoured tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

Missouri is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　Ranking 21st in land area, it is bordered by eight states (tied for the most with Tennessee): Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska to the west. 　In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. 　The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. 　With more than six million residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. 　The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City. 　Humans have inhabited what is now Missouri for at least 12,000 years. 　The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. 　When European explorers arrived in the 17th century, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. 　The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. 　Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. 　After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. 　Americans from the Upland South, including enslaved African Americans, rushed into the new Missouri Territory. 　Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. 　Many from Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. 　Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland. 　Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. 　The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri. 　As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. 　After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. 　Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. 　Missouri's culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. 　It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. 　The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond. 　Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. 　It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. 　Outside the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. 　Well-known Missourians include Chuck Berry, Sheryl Crow, Walt Disney, Edwin Hubble, Nelly, Brad Pitt, Harry S. Truman, and Mark Twain. 　Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. 　Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis. 　Missouri has been called the "Mother of the West" and the "Cave State", but its most famous nickname is the "Show Me State".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar>Familiar</a> 
<font size=3>
In European folklore of the medieval and early modern periods, familiars (sometimes referred to as familiar spirits) were believed to be supernatural entities that would assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic. 　According to records of the time, those alleging to have had contact with familiar spirits reported that they could manifest as numerous forms, usually as an animal, but sometimes as a human or humanoid figure, and were described as "clearly defined, three-dimensional... forms, vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound", as opposed to descriptions of ghosts with their "smoky, undefined form[s]". 　When they served witches, they were often thought to be malevolent, but when working for cunning folk they were often considered benevolent (although there was some ambiguity in both cases). 　The former were often categorized as demons, while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies. 　The main purpose of familiars was to serve the witch, providing protection for them as they came into their new powers. 　Since the 20th century some magical practitioners, including adherents of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, use the concept of familiars, due to their association with older forms of magic. 　These contemporary practitioners use pets or wildlife, or believe that invisible versions of familiars act as magical aides.

<font size=3>
Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ (listen), other variants) is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. 　It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains, as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. 　Colorado is the eighth most extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. 　The 2020 United States census enumerated the population of Colorado at 5,773,714, an increase of 14.80% since the 2010 United States census. 　The region has been inhabited by Native Americans and their ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. 　The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. 　"Colorado" is the Spanish adjective meaning "ruddy", the color of the Fountain Formation outcroppings found up and down the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. 　The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. 　Colorado is nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state one century after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. 　Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, and Utah to the west, and touches Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. 　Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. 　Colorado is one of the Mountain States, and is a part of the western and is often considered to be part of the southwestern United States. 　Denver is the capital of and most populous city in Colorado. 　Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although the antiquated "Coloradoan" is occasionally used. 　Major parts of the economy include government and defense, mining, agriculture, tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing. 　With increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability, Colorado's agriculture, forestry, and tourism economies are expected to be heavily affected by climate change. 　Colorado is one of the most educated, developed, and wealthiest states, ranking 3rd in percentage of population 25 and over with a bachelor's degree and 8th in percentage of population 25 and over with an advanced degree, 9th on the American Human Development Index, 8th in per capita income and 9th in median household income.

Kansas (/ˈkænzəs/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States. 　Its capital is Topeka, and its largest city is Wichita. 　Kansas is a landlocked state bordered by Nebraska to the north; Missouri to the east; Oklahoma to the south; and Colorado to the west. 　Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. 　The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean "people of the (south) wind" although this was probably not the term's original meaning. 　For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. 　Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. 　Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. 　The first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth. 　The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate. 　When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. 　Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as Bleeding Kansas. 　The abolitionists prevailed, and on January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state, hence the unofficial nickname "The Free State". 　By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. 　Kansas, which has an area of 82,278 square miles (213,100 square kilometers) is the 15th-largest state by area and is the 36th most-populous of the 50 states, with a population of 2,940,865 according to the 2020 census. 　Residents of Kansas are called Kansans. 　Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest point at 4,039 feet (1,231 meters).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem>Theorem</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved, or can be proved. 　The proof of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system to establish that the theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems. 　In the mainstream of mathematics, the axioms and the inference rules are commonly left implicit, and, in this case, they are almost always those of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, or of a less powerful theory, such as Peano arithmetic. 　A notable exception is Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which involves the Grothendieck universes whose existence requires the addition of a new axiom to the set theory. 　Generally, an assertion that is explicitly called a theorem is a proved result that is not an immediate consequence of other known theorems. 　Moreover, many authors qualify as theorems only the most important results, and use the terms lemma, proposition and corollary for less important theorems. 　In mathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. 　In this context, statements become well-formed formulas of some formal language. 　A theory consists of some basis statements called axioms, and some deducing rules (sometimes included in the axioms). 　The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms by using the deducing rules. 　This formalization led to proof theory, which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. 　In particular, Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that every consistent theory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory). 　As the axioms are often abstractions of properties of the physical world, theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, but in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental, the justification of the truth of a theorem is purely deductive.

<font size=3>
Queensland (locally /ˈkwiːnzlænd/ KWEENZ-land) is a state situated in northeastern Australia, and is the second-largest and third-most populous of the Australian states. 　It is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, southwest and south respectively. 　To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean; to its north is the Torres Strait, separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea. 　With an area of 1,852,642 square kilometres (715,309 sq mi), Queensland is the world's sixth-largest sub-national entity; it is larger than all but 15 countries. 　Due to its size, Queensland's geographical features and climates are diverse, including tropical rainforests, rivers, coral reefs, mountain ranges and sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior. 　Queensland has a population of over 5.2 million, concentrated along the coast and particularly in South East Queensland. 　The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city. 　Ten of Australia's thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, with the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. 　The state's population is multicultural, with 28.9% of inhabitants being immigrants. 　Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. 　Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. 　In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. 　In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. 　Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. 　Queensland was separated from New South Wales on 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day), thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government, named in honour of Queen Victoria. 　Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. 　Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration. 　Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education, insurance and banking. 　Nicknamed the Sunshine State for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, Great Barrier Reef and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state's economy.

<font size=3>
A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through surrounding soil, earth or rock, and enclosed except for the entrance and exit, commonly at each end. 　A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods. 　A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic, for rail traffic, or for a canal. 　The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel. 　Some tunnels are used as sewers or aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations. 　Utility tunnels are used for routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment. 　Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, or by civilians for smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people. 　Special tunnels, such as wildlife crossings, are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely. 　Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror>Mirror</a> 
<font size=3>
A mirror or looking glass is an object that reflects an image. 　Light that bounces off a mirror will show an image of whatever is in front of it, when focused through the lens of the eye or a camera. 　Mirrors reverse the direction of the image in an equal yet opposite angle from which the light shines upon it. 　This allows the viewer to see themselves or objects behind them, or even objects that are at an angle from them but out of their field of view, such as around a corner. 　Natural mirrors have existed since prehistoric times, such as the surface of water, but people have been manufacturing mirrors out of a variety of materials for thousands of years, like stone, metals, and glass. 　In modern mirrors, metals like silver or aluminium are often used due to their high reflectivity, applied as a thin coating on glass because of its naturally smooth and very hard surface. 　A mirror is a wave reflector. 　Light consists of waves, and when light waves reflect from the flat surface of a mirror, those waves retain the same degree of curvature and vergence, in an equal yet opposite direction, as the original waves. 　This allows the waves to form an image when they are focused through a lens, just as if the waves had originated from the direction of the mirror. 　The light can also be pictured as rays (imaginary lines radiating from the light source, that are always perpendicular to the waves). 　These rays are reflected at an equal yet opposite angle from which they strike the mirror (incident light). 　This property, called specular reflection, distinguishes a mirror from objects that diffuse light, breaking up the wave and scattering it in many directions (such as flat-white paint). 　Thus, a mirror can be any surface in which the texture or roughness of the surface is smaller (smoother) than the wavelength of the waves. 　When looking at a mirror, one will see a mirror image or reflected image of objects in the environment, formed by light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes. 　This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behind the mirror, or (sometimes) in front of it. 　When the surface is not flat, a mirror may behave like a reflecting lens. 　A plane mirror yields a real-looking undistorted image, while a curved mirror may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various ways, while keeping the lines, contrast, sharpness, colors, and other image properties intact. 　A mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, such as during personal grooming; hence the old-fashioned name "looking glass". 　This use, which dates from prehistory, overlaps with uses in decoration and architecture. 　Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible because of obstructions; examples include rear-view mirrors in vehicles, security mirrors in or around buildings, and dentist's mirrors. 　Mirrors are also used in optical and scientific apparatus such as telescopes, lasers, cameras, periscopes, and industrial machinery. 　According to superstitions breaking a mirror is said to bring seven years of bad luck. 　The terms "mirror" and "reflector" can be used for objects that reflect any other types of waves. 　An acoustic mirror reflects sound waves. 　Objects such as walls, ceilings, or natural rock-formations may produce echos, and this tendency often becomes a problem in acoustical engineering when designing houses, auditoriums, or recording studios. 　Acoustic mirrors may be used for applications such as parabolic microphones, atmospheric studies, sonar, and seafloor mapping. 　An atomic mirror reflects matter waves and can be used for atomic interferometry and atomic holography.

<font size=3>
Collaboration (from Latin com- "with" + laborare "to labor", "to work") is the process of two or more people, entities or organizations working together to complete a task or achieve a goal. 　Collaboration is similar to cooperation. 　Most collaboration requires leadership,[vague] although the form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group. 　Teams that work collaboratively often access greater resources, recognition and rewards when facing competition for finite resources. 　Structured methods of collaboration encourage introspection of behavior and communication. 　Such methods aim to increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem-solving. 　Collaboration is present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a common use of the term. 　In its applied sense, "(a) collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome."
