## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury>Injury</a> 
<font size=3>
An injury is any physiological damage to living tissue caused by immediate physical stress. 　An injury can occur intentionally or unintentionally and may be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burning, toxic exposure, asphyxiation, or overexertion. 　Injuries can occur in any part of the body, and different symptoms are associated with different injuries. 　Treatment of a major injury is typically carried out by a health professional and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. 　Traffic collisions are the most common cause of accidental injury and injury-related death among humans. 　Injuries are distinct from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, infections, or medical procedures, though injury can be a contributing factor to any of these. 　Several major health organizations have established systems for the classification and description of human injuries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade>Brigade</a> 
<font size=3>
A brigade is a major tactical military formation that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. 　It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. 　Two or more brigades may constitute a division. 　Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). 　In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. 　Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups. 　On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task. 　Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. 　Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure. 　The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 5,000 troops. 　However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could start as high as 10,000 troops. 　The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use "regiment" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II. 　A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. 　In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. 　The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. 　The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. 　Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. 　Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. 　The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. 　On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. 　The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit. 　In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.

A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. 　In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. 　Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. 　Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. 　Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history. 　In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. 　Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. 　The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.

<font size=3>
Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game, often competitive and/or organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 　Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. 　Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 　In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. 　Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. 　A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 　Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. 　Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition. 　Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports. 　However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. 　The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. 　Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 　Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 　It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression. 　Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. 　Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. 　Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport. 　According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. 　The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.

Progress is the movement towards a refined, improved, or otherwise desired state. 　In the context of progressivism, it refers to the proposition that advancements in technology, science, and social organization have resulted, and by extension will continue to result, in an improved human condition; the latter may happen as a result of direct human action, as in social enterprise or through activism, or as a natural part of sociocultural evolution. 　The concept of progress was introduced in the early-19th-century social theories, especially social evolution as described by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. 　It was present in the Enlightenment's philosophies of history. 　As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

In artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the term situated refers to an agent which is embedded in an environment. 　The term situated is commonly used to refer to robots, but some researchers argue that software agents can also be situated if: they exist in a dynamic (rapidly changing) environment, which they can manipulate or change through their actions, and which they can sense or perceive. 　Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as Second Life. 　Being situated is generally considered to be part of being embodied, but it is useful to consider each perspective individually. 　The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behaviour derives from the environment and the agent's interactions with it. 　The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.

Colonel (abbreviated as Col., Col or COL) is a senior military officer rank used in many countries. 　It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. 　In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army. 　Modern usage varies greatly, and in some cases, the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military service. 　The rank of colonel is typically above the rank of lieutenant colonel. 　The rank above colonel is typically called brigadier, brigade general or brigadier general. 　In some smaller military forces, such as those of Monaco or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. 　Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain. 　In the Commonwealth's air force ranking system, the equivalent rank is group captain.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea>Korea</a> 
<font size=3>
Korea (Korean: 한국, Hanguk or 조선, Joseon) is a peninsular region in East Asia. 　Since 1945, it has been divided at or near the 38th parallel, with North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) comprising its northern half and South Korea (Republic of Korea) comprising its southern half. 　Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. 　The peninsula is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. 　It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea). 　During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. 　In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the "Unified Silla" period. 　Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. 　Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. 　Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. 　Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. 　Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. 　However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. 　Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon on 17 July 1392. 　The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace. 　During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. 　During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "hermit kingdom". 　Korea was removed from Chinese suzerainty following the Qing dynasty's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, and Gojong of Korea subsequently proclaimed the Korean Empire in 1897. 　The unexpected victory of Japan in the Russo-Japanese War spelled the end of Russian imperial ambitions in Korea, and Japan was left with no other rivals in the region. 　The Korean Empire subsequently became a protectorate of Japan on 17 November 1905, and was later annexed by Japan on 22 August 1910. 　Japan relinquished control over Korea after formally surrendering to the Allies on 2 September 1945, in the aftermath of World War II. 　The Soviet Union and the United States had agreed to partition Korea along the 38th parallel, with the Soviets occupying the north and the Americans occupying the south. 　These circumstances became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers with two different ideologies, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. 　The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two sovereign states in 1948: North Korea, and South Korea. 　Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. 　With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalised peace treaty. 　This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula, and both states continue to claim to be the sole legitimate one of the region. 　A breakthrough in the peace process came on 27 April 2018, when North Korea and South Korea signed the Panmunjom Declaration on ending the conflict and reunifying Korea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand>Brand</a> 
<font size=3>
A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that distinguishes one seller's good or service from those of other sellers. 　Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. 　Brand names are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands. 　The practice of branding - in the original literal sense of marking by burning - is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who are known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE.　[need quotation to verify] Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron. 　If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. 　The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that "brand" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. 　It includes the voice and the tonality of the business. 　Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry). 　Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice. 　In the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers. 　The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by logos and trademarks), brand awareness, brand loyalty, and various branding (brand management) strategies. 　Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of product differentiation. 　Brand equity is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components. 　As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity. 　A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits. 　When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity. 　Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. 　In accounting, a brand, defined as an intangible asset, is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. 　Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value. 　Brand valuation is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. 　Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value. 　The word "brand" is often used as a metonym referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. 　Marque or make are often used to denote a brand of motor vehicle, which may be distinguished from a car model. 　A concept brand is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like breast-cancer awareness or environmentalism, rather than a specific product, service, or business. 　A commodity brand is a brand associated with a commodity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection>Detection</a> 
<font size=3>
In general, detection is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from with the sender. 　In the history of radio communications, the term "detector" was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio signal, since all communications were in Morse code. 　The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic waves present. 　Detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier signal, as in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting, but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from noise, as in radio astronomy, or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in steganography. 　In optoelectronics, "detection" means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. 　For example, the light signal received through an optical fiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode. 　In steganography, attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as steganalysis. 　Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. 　In the military, detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance. 　Finally, the art of detection, also known as following clues, is the work of a detective in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.

<font size=3>
A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience. 　The performance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, choir, or band. 　Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls, amphitheatres and parks, to large multipurpose buildings, such as arenas and stadiums. 　Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts. 　Informal names for a concert include show and gig. 　Regardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage (if not actual then an area of the floor designated as such). 　Concerts often require live event support with professional audio equipment. 　Before recorded music, concerts provided the main opportunity to hear musicians play. 　For large concerts or concert tours, the challenging logistics of arranging the musicians, venue, equipment and audience (ticket sales) are handled by professional tour promoters.

<font size=3>
Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the processing of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. 　Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE), although this theory is disputed by some. 　Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. 　Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. 　"Natural philosophy," which began as a discipline in ancient India and Ancient Greece, encompasses astronomy, medicine, and physics. 　For example, Isaac Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. 　In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. 　Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the social sciences such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics. 　Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises. 　Other notable subfields include philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.

<font size=3>
A gate or gateway is a point of entry to or from a space enclosed by walls. 　The word derived from old Norse "gat" meaning road or path; But other terms include yett and port. 　The concept originally referred to the gap or hole in the wall or fence, rather than a barrier which closed it. 　Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative. 　The moving part or parts of a gateway may be considered "doors", as they are fixed at one side whilst opening and closing like one. 　A gate may have a latch that can be raised and lowered to both open a gate or prevent it from swinging. 　Locks are also used on gates to increase the security. 　Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a castle or fortified town. 　Actual doors can also be considered gates when they are used to block entry as prevalent within a gatehouse. 　Today, many gate doors are opened by an automated gate operator.
