<font size=3>
A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. 　The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control. 　The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials. 　Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. 　Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. 　Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market garden). 　Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses. 　The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one. 　Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. 　Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden, which etymologically implies enclosure, often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden. 　Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all. 　Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether. 　Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at many scales and working on both public and private projects.

<font size=3>
Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch. 　For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation. 　Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems. 　The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of braille).

<font size=3>
Reference is a relationship between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. 　The first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. 　It is called a name for the second object. 　The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the referent of the first object. 　A name is usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. 　Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept. 　References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional state, relationship with other, spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or an energy projection. 　In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography.　[citation needed] References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. 　Some of them are described in the sections below.

<font size=3>
Pennsylvania (/ˌpɛnsɪlˈveɪniə/ (listen); Pennsylvania German: Pennsilfaani), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state spanning the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Appalachian, and Great Lakes regions of the United States. 　It borders Delaware to its southeast, Maryland to its south, West Virginia to its southwest, Ohio to its west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to its northwest, New York state to its north, and the Delaware River and New Jersey to its east. 　Pennsylvania is the fifth-most populous state in the nation with over 13 million residents as of 2020[update]. 　It is the 33rd-largest state by area and ranks ninth among all states in population density. 　The southeastern Delaware Valley metropolitan area comprises and surrounds Philadelphia, the state's largest and nation's sixth most populous city. 　Another 2.37 million reside in Greater Pittsburgh in the southwest, centered on Pittsburgh, the state's second-largest and Western Pennsylvania's largest city. 　The state's subsequent five most populous cities are: Allentown, Reading, Erie, Scranton, and Bethlehem. 　The state capital is Harrisburg. 　Pennsylvania's geography is highly diverse: the Appalachian Mountains run through the center of the state; the Allegheny and Pocono mountains span much of Northeast Pennsylvania; close to 60% of the state is forested. 　While it has only 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River, Pennsylvania has more navigable rivers than any other state in the nation, including the Delaware, Ohio, and Pine Creek rivers. 　Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 through a royal land grant to William Penn, son of the state's namesake; a southeast portion of the state was once part of the colony of New Sweden. 　Established as a haven for religious and political tolerance, the Province of Pennsylvania was known for its relatively peaceful relations with native tribes, innovative government system, and religious pluralism. 　Pennsylvania was one of thirteen British colonies from which the nation was formed. 　Pennsylvania played a vital and historic role in the American Revolution and the ultimately successful quest for independence from the British Empire. 　Its largest city, Philadelphia, was the gathering place of the nation's Founding Fathers and home to much of the thinking, activism, and writing that inspired the American Revolution. 　Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in Carpenters' Hall in 1774, and, beginning the following year, the Second Continental Congress in Independence Hall, which in 1776 unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, a document that historian Joseph Ellis has described as "the most potent and consequential words in American history" and which formally launched the American Revolutionary War. 　On December 25 and 26, 1776, Washington secretly led a column of Continental Army troops across the Delaware River from Bucks County, launching a successful surprise attack against Hessian mercenaries at the Battle of Trenton. 　In 1777 and 1778, the national capital of Philadelphia fell under British control for nine months, and multiple Revolutionary War battles were fought in Pennsylvania. 　For six months, Washington and 12,000 Continental Army troops encamped at Valley Forge over a harsh winter with limited supplies; roughly 1,700 to 2,000 of them died at Valley Forge from disease and malnutrition. 　In Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress, on June 21, 1778, ratified the Articles of Confederation, which served as the foundation for the ultimate development and ratification of the U.S. Constitution. 　On December 12, 1787, Pennsylvania became the second state after Delaware, which had previously been part of Pennsylvania as the three lower counties, to ratify the Constitution. 　On eight separate occasions prior to the construction of Washington, D.C. as the nation's capital, a Pennsylvania city served as the nation's capital. 　Philadelphia served as the nation's capital on six separate occasions, including from 1775 to 1776, in 1777, twice in 1778, in 1781, and from 1790 to 1800; York and Lancaster both briefly served as the nation's capital in 1777. 　During the American Civil War, Pennsylvania's 360,000 Union Army volunteers proved influential in strengthening the Union, successfully guarding the national capital of Washington, D.C., which was vulnerable following the fall of Fort Sumter, and later leading daring raids against Confederate Army strongholds in the Deep South. 　The bloodiest battle of the Civil War with over 50,000 casualties, and one of the Union Army's most important victories, was fought on Pennsylvania soil at Gettysburg over three days in July 1863. 　The Union Army's victory at Gettysburg is considered the turning point in the war, leading to the Union's preservation. 　President Abraham Lincoln's 271-word address dedicating Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863, remains one of the best-known speeches in American history. 　In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, Bethlehem-based Bethlehem Steel, and other Pennsylvania manufacturing companies inspired the American Industrial Revolution and contributed to the development of much of the nation's early infrastructure, including key bridges, skyscrapers, and warships, tanks, and other military hardware used in U.S.-led victories in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. 　Since Pennsylvania's 1787 founding, a number of influential Pennsylvanians have contributed significantly to the nation in many fields, including the military, politics, business, scientific innovation, thought leadership, philanthropy, music, art, and sports.

<font size=3>
Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal. 　Planning is based on foresight, the fundamental capacity for mental time travel. 　The evolution of forethought, the capacity to think ahead, is considered to have been a prime mover in human evolution. 　Planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior. 　It involves the use of logic and imagination to visualise not only a desired end result, but the steps necessary to achieve that result. 　An important aspect of planning is its relationship to forecasting. 　Forecasting aims to predict what the future will look like, while planning imagines what the future could look like. 　Planning according to established principles is a core part of many professional occupations, particularly in fields such as management and business. 　Once a plan has been developed it is possible to measure and assess progress, efficiency and effectiveness. 　As circumstances change, plans may need to be modified or even abandoned.

<font size=3>
A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes. 　Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. 　Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. 　The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables. 　Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. 　The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin: Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant 'napkin' or 'cloth' and mundi 'the world'. 　Thus, "map" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate>Senate</a> 

<font size=3>
A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature. 　The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "old man") and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. 　However the Roman Senate was not the ancestor or predecessor of modern parliamentarism in any sense, because the Roman senate was not a legislative body. 　Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. 　Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected. 　Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. 　Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning>Turning</a> 

<font size=3>
Turning is a machining process in which a cutting tool, typically a non-rotary tool bit, describes a helix toolpath by moving more or less linearly while the workpiece rotates. 　Usually the term "turning" is reserved for the generation of external surfaces by this cutting action, whereas this same essential cutting action when applied to internal surfaces (holes, of one kind or another) is called "boring". 　Thus the phrase "turning and boring" categorizes the larger family of processes known as lathing. 　The cutting of faces on the workpiece, whether with a turning or boring tool, is called "facing", and may be lumped into either category as a subset. 　Turning can be done manually, in a traditional form of lathe, which frequently requires continuous supervision by the operator, or by using an automated lathe which does not. 　Today the most common type of such automation is computer numerical control, better known as CNC. 　(CNC is also commonly used with many other types of machining besides turning.) 　When turning, the workpiece (a piece of relatively rigid material such as wood, metal, plastic, or stone) is rotated and a cutting tool is traversed along 1, 2, or 3 axes of motion to produce precise diameters and depths. 　Turning can be either on the outside of the cylinder or on the inside (also known as boring) to produce tubular components to various geometries. 　Although now quite rare, early lathes could even be used to produce complex geometric figures, even the platonic solids; although since the advent of CNC it has become unusual to use non-computerized toolpath control for this purpose. 　The turning processes are typically carried out on a lathe, considered to be the oldest of machine tools, and can be of different types such as straight turning, taper turning, profiling or external grooving. 　Those types of turning processes can produce various shapes of materials such as straight, conical, curved, or grooved workpieces. 　In general, turning uses simple single-point cutting tools. 　Each group of workpiece materials has an optimum set of tool angles that have been developed through the years. 　The bits of waste metal from turning operations are known as chips (North America), or swarf (Britain). 　In some areas they may be known as turnings. 　The tool's axes of movement may be literally a straight line, or they may be along some set of curves or angles, but they are essentially linear (in the non mathematical sense). 　A component that is subject to turning operations can be termed as a “Turned Part” or “Machined Component”. 　Turning operations are carried out on a lathe machine which can be manually or CNC operated.

<font size=3>
A lieutenant (UK: /lɛfˈtɛnənt/ lef-TEN-ənt, US: /luːˈtɛnənt/ loo-TEN-ənt; abbreviated Lt., Lt, LT, Lieut and similar) is a commissioned officer rank in the armed forces of many nations. 　The meaning of lieutenant differs in different militaries (see comparative military ranks), but it is often subdivided into senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant and even third lieutenant) ranks. 　In navies, it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank. 　The rank is also used in fire services, emergency medical services, security services and police forces. 　Lieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure. 　It often designates someone who is "second-in-command", and as such, may precede the name of the rank directly above it. 　For example, a "lieutenant master" is likely to be second-in-command to the "master" in an organisation using both ranks. 　Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments, such as the viceregal representatives of the Crown in Canadian provinces. 　In the United Kingdom, a lord lieutenant is the sovereign's representative in a county or lieutenancy area, while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant's deputies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)>Boundary (topology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In topology and mathematics in general, the boundary of a subset S of a topological space X is the set of points in the closure of S not belonging to the interior of S. An element of the boundary of S is called a boundary point of S. The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. 　Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd ⁡ ( S ) , fr ⁡ ( S ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {bd} (S),\operatorname {fr} (S),} and ∂ S {\displaystyle \partial S} . 　Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with a different definition used in algebraic topology and the theory of manifolds. 　Despite widespread acceptance of the meaning of the terms boundary and frontier, they have sometimes been used to refer to other sets. 　For example, Metric Spaces by E. T. Copson uses the term boundary to refer to Hausdorff's border, which is defined as the intersection of a set with its boundary. 　Hausdorff also introduced the term residue, which is defined as the intersection of a set with the closure of the border of its complement. 　A connected component of the boundary of S is called a boundary component of S.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder>Murder</a> 

<font size=3>
Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. 　This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. 　Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. 　Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness. 　Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, or incapacitation. 　In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, a life sentence, or capital punishment.

<font size=3>
Boston (US: /ˈbɔːstən/), officially the City of Boston, is the state capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the cultural and financial center of the New England region of the United States. 　It is the 24th-most populous city in the country. 　The city boundaries encompass an area of about 48.4 sq mi (125 km2) and a population of 675,647 as of 2020. 　The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest MSA in the country. 　A broader combined statistical area (CSA), generally corresponding to the commuting area and including Providence, Rhode Island, is home to approximately 8.2 million people, making it the sixth most populous in the United States. 　Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in America, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name. 　It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution and the nation's founding, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. 　Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture. 　The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. 　Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year. 　Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635) first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897), and first large public library (Boston Public Library, 1848). 　Today, Boston is a center of scientific research; the area's many colleges and universities, notably Harvard and MIT, make it a world leader in higher education, including law, medicine, engineering and business, and the city is considered to be a global pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 5,000 startups. 　Boston's economic base also includes finance, professional and business services, biotechnology, information technology, and government activities. 　Boston is a hub for LGBT culture and LGBT activism in the United States. 　Households in the city claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the United States. 　Boston businesses and institutions rank among the top in the country for environmental sustainability and new investment.

<font size=3>
In critical theory, sociology, and psychoanalysis, the gaze (French le regard), in the philosophical and figurative sense, is an individual's (or a group's) awareness and perception of other individuals, other groups, or oneself. 　The concept and the social applications of the gaze have been defined and explained by existentialist and phenomenologist philosophers. 　Jean-Paul Sartre described the gaze (or "the look") in Being and Nothingness (1943). 　Michel Foucault, in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (1975), developed the concept of the gaze to illustrate the dynamics of socio-political power relations and the social dynamics of society's mechanisms of discipline. 　Jacques Derrida, in The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Come) (1997), elaborated upon the inter-species relations that exist among human beings and other animals, which are established by way of the gaze.

A teacher, also called a schoolteacher or formally an educator, is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence, or virtue, via the practice of teaching. 　Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). 　In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. 　Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor). 　In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. 　This article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education context, such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.

<font size=3>
A lie is an assertion that is believed to be false, typically used with the purpose of deceiving or misleading someone. 　The practice of communicating lies is called lying. 　A person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar. 　Lies can be interpreted as deliberately false statements or misleading statements. 　Lies may also serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them. 　Generally, the term "lie" carries a negative connotation, and depending on the context a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions; for instance, perjury, or the act of lying under oath, can result in criminal and civil charges being pressed against the perjurer. 　Although people in many cultures believe that deception can be detected by observing nonverbal behaviors (e.g. not making eye contact, fidgeting, stuttering) research indicates that people overestimate both the significance of such cues and their ability to make accurate judgements about deception. 　More generally, people's ability to make true judgments is affected by biases towards accepting incoming information and interpreting feelings as evidence of truth. 　People do not always check incoming assertions against their memory.

<font size=3>
A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury. 　Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. 　A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. 　For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders. 　In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. 　In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. 　Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life. 　Death due to disease is called death by natural causes. 　There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. 　Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases. 　The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections. 　In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. 　The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.

<font size=3>
Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: To~uwaisu; commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. 　The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. 　Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins. 　Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. 　Their next single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. 　The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. 　Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album. 　As of December 2020, the group has sold over 15 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan. 　The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. 　The album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. 　It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. 　Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single in the same year. 　Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour. 　Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single "Likey" in 2017. 　With the release of their single "Feel Special" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the Canadian Hot 100. 　After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group has charted into the US Billboard 200 with More & More and Eyes Wide Open in 2020, Taste of Love and Formula of Love: O+T=<3 in 2021, and Between 1&2 in 2022. 　Their first official English-language single, "The Feels", became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. 　They have been dubbed the next "Nation's Girl Group", and their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "Signal" (2017), and "What Is Love?" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.

A kiss is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object. 　Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely. 　Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of love, passion, romance, sexual attraction, sexual activity, sexual arousal, affection, respect, greeting, peace, and good luck, among many others. 　In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or a sacramental. 　The word came from Old English cyssan ("to kiss"), in turn from coss ("a kiss").

<font size=3>
Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. 　Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. 　Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. 　This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview>Interview</a> 

<font size=3>
An interview is a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers. 　In common parlance, the word "interview" refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee. 　The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually providing information. 　That information may be used or provided to other audiences immediately or later. 　This feature is common to many types of interviews – a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time, but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process. 　An interview may also transfer information in both directions. 　Interviews usually take place face-to-face, in person, but the parties may instead be separated geographically, as in videoconferencing or telephone interviews. 　Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties. 　In some instances a "conversation" can happen between two persons who type their questions and answers. 　Interviews can be unstructured, free-wheeling and open-ended conversations without predetermined plan or prearranged questions. 　One form of unstructured interview is a focused interview in which the interviewer consciously and consistently guides the conversation so that the interviewee's responses do not stray from the main research topic or idea. 　Interviews can also be highly structured conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order. 　They can follow diverse formats; for example, in a ladder interview, a respondent's answers typically guide subsequent interviews, with the object being to explore a respondent's subconscious motives. 　Typically the interviewer has some way of recording the information that is gleaned from the interviewee, often by keeping notes with a pencil and paper, or with a video or audio recorder. 　Interviews usually have a limited duration, with a beginning and an ending. 　The traditionally two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and follow-ups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy and relevance of responses. 　It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. 　Further, it eliminates possible distortion due to other parties being present. 　Face to face interviewing helps both parties to interact and form a connection, and understand the other. 　Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.

<font size=3>
In biological taxonomy, a domain (/dəˈmeɪn/ or /doʊˈmeɪn/) (Latin: regio), also dominion, superkingdom, realm, or empire, is the highest taxonomic rank of all organisms taken together. 　It was introduced in the three-domain system of taxonomy devised by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990. 　According to the domain system, the tree of life consists of either three domains such as Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, or two domains consisting of Archaea and Bacteria, with Eukarya included in Archaea. 　The first two are all prokaryotes, single-celled microorganisms without a membrane-bound nucleus. 　All organisms that have a cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles are included in Eukarya. 　Non-cellular life is not included in this system. 　Alternatives to the three-domain system include the earlier two-empire system (with the empires Prokaryota and Eukaryota), and the eocyte hypothesis (with two domains of Bacteria and Archaea, with Eukarya included as a branch of Archaea).

A label (as distinct from signage) is a piece of paper, plastic film, cloth, metal, or other material affixed to a container or product, on which is written or printed information or symbols about the product or item. 　Information printed directly on a container or article can also be considered labelling. 　Labels have many uses, including promotion and providing information on a product's origin, the manufacturer (e.g., brand name), use, safety, shelf-life and disposal, some or all of which may be governed by legislation such as that for food in the UK or United States. 　Methods of production and attachment to packaging are many and various and may also be subject to internationally recognised standards. 　In many countries, hazardous products such as poisons or flammable liquids must have a warning label.

<font size=3>
A label is an abstract concept in sociology used to group people together based on perceived or held identity. 　Labels are a mode of identifying social groups. 　Labels can create a sense of community within groups, but they can also cause harm when used to separate individuals and groups from mainstream society. 　Individuals may choose a label, or they may be assigned one by others. 　The act of labeling may affect an individual's behavior and their reactions to the social world. 　Symbolic interactionism and labeling theory both examine labels as a social concept, and emphasize the social weight of labels and labeling. 　Symbolic interactionism focuses on expectations of social roles, while labeling theory focuses on the social and individual consequences of labeling. 　Both theories link between labels and contexts and maintain that their meanings are socially defined rather than universal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency>Frequency</a> 

<font size=3>
Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. 　It is also occasionally referred to as temporal frequency for clarity, and is distinct from angular frequency. 　Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) which is equal to one event per second. 　The period is the interval of time between events, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. 　For example, if a heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute (2 hertz), the period, T—the interval at which the beats repeat—is half a second (60 seconds divided by 120 beats). 　Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals (sound), radio waves, and light.

<font size=3>
A farm (also called an agricultural holding) is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. 　The name is used for specialized units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fiber, biofuel and other commodities. 　It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. 　In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. 　There are about 570 million farms in the world, most of which are small and family-operated. 　Small farms with a land area of fewer than 2 hectares operate about 1% of the world's agricultural land, and family farms comprise about 75% of the world's agricultural land. 　Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. 　In the United States, livestock may be raised on range, land and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. 　In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. 　In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. 　In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market. 　Acres can hold the crops.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication>Communication</a> 

<font size=3>
Communication is usually defined as the transmission of information. 　The term can also refer to the message itself or the field of inquiry studying these transmissions, also known as communication studies. 　There are some disagreements about the precise definition of communication, for example, whether unintentional or failed transmissions are also included and whether communication does not just transmit meaning but also create it. 　Models of communication aim to provide a simplified overview of its main components and their interaction. 　Many models include the idea that a source uses a coding system to express information in the form of a message. 　The source uses a channel to send the message to a receiver who has to decode it in order to understand its meaning. 　Channels are usually discussed in terms of the senses used to perceive the message, like hearing, sight, smell, touch, and taste. 　Communication can be classified based on whether information is exchanged between humans, members of other species, or non-living entities such as computers. 　For human communication, an important distinction is between verbal and non-verbal communication. 　Verbal communication involves the exchange of messages in linguistic form. 　This can happen through natural languages, like English or Japanese, or through artificial languages, like Esperanto. 　Verbal communication includes spoken and written messages as well as the use of sign language. 　Non-verbal communication happens without the use of a linguistic system. 　There are many forms of non-verbal communication, for example, using body language, body position, touch, and intonation. 　Another important distinction is between interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. 　Interpersonal communication happens between distinct individuals, such as greeting someone on the street or making a phone call. 　Intrapersonal communication, on the other hand, refers to communication with oneself. 　This can happen internally, as a form of inner dialog or daydreaming, or externally, for example, when writing down a shopping list or engaging in a monologue. 　Non-human forms of communication include animal and plant communication. 　Researchers in this field often formulate additional criteria for their definition of communicative behavior, like the requirement that the behavior serves a beneficial function for natural selection or that a response to the message is observed. 　Animal communication plays important roles for various species in the areas of courtship and mating, parent-offspring relations, social relations, navigation, self-defense, and territoriality. 　In the area of courtship and mating, for example, communication is used to identify and attract potential mates. 　An often-discussed example concerning navigational communication is the waggle dance used by bees to indicate to other bees where flowers are located. 　Due to the rigid cell walls of plants, their communication often happens through chemical means rather than movement. 　For example, various plants, like maple trees, release so-called volatile organic compounds into the air to warn other plants of a herbivore attack. 　Most communication takes place between members of the same species since its purpose is usually some form of cooperation, which is not as common between species. 　However, there are also forms of interspecies communication, mainly in cases of symbiotic relationships. 　For example, many flowers use symmetrical shapes and colors that stand out from their surroundings in order to communicate to insects where nectar is located to attract them. 　Humans also practice interspecies communication, for example, when interacting with pets. 　The field of communication includes various other issues, like communicative competence and the history of communication. 　Communicative competence refers to the ability to communicate well and applies both to the capability to formulate messages and to understand them. 　Two central aspects are that the communicative behavior is effective, i.e. that it achieves the individual's goal, and that it is appropriate, i.e. that it follows social standards and expectations. 　Human communication has a long history and how people exchange information has changed over time. 　These changes were usually triggered by the development of new communication technologies, such as the invention of writing systems (first pictographic and later alphabetic), the development of mass printing, the use of radio and television, and the invention of the internet.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price>Price</a> 

<font size=3>
A price is the (usually not negative) quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for goods or services. 　In some situations, the price of production has a different name. 　If the product is a "good" in the commercial exchange, the payment for this product will likely be called its "price". 　However, if the product is "service", there will be other possible names for this product's name. 　For example, the graph on the bottom will show some situations A good's price is influenced by production costs, supply of the desired item, and demand for the product. 　A price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions. 　Price can be quoted to currency, quantities of goods or vouchers. 　In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. 　(More specifically, for raw materials they are expressed as currency per unit weight, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.) 　Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. 　Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. 　In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War II. 　In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common. 　In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways. 　The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. 　The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. 　Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. 　For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued. 　"Price" sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. 　This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called transaction price or traded price. 　Likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets. 　Economic price theory asserts that in a free market economy the market price reflects interaction between supply and demand: the price is set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded. 　In turn, these quantities are determined by the marginal utility of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers. 　Supply and demand, and hence price, may be influenced by other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion. 　When a raw material or a similar economic good for sale at multiple locations, the law of one price is generally believed to hold. 　This essentially states that the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax>Tax</a> 

<font size=3>
A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national), and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs. 　The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC. 　A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. 　Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent. 　Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. 　Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. 　Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. 　Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs. 　In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. 　This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). 　Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner, others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von>Von</a> 

<font size=3>
The term von ([fɔn]) is used in German language surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means of or from. 　Nobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant "Hans from [the city of] Duisburg". 　This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility.

<font size=3>
Leadership, both as a research area and as a practical skill, encompasses the ability of an individual, group or organization to "lead", influence or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. 　The word "leadership" often gets viewed as a contested term. 　Specialist literature debates various viewpoints on the concept, sometimes contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) North American versus European approaches. 　U.S. academic environments define leadership as "a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common and ethical task". 　Basically, leadership can be defined as an influential power-relationship in which the power of one party (the "leader") promotes movement/change in others (the "followers"). 　Some have challenged the more traditional managerial views of leadership (which portray leadership as something possessed or owned by one individual due to their role or authority), and instead advocate the complex nature of leadership which is found at all levels of institutions, both within formal and informal roles.　[need quotation to verify] Studies of leadership have produced theories involving (for example) traits, situational interaction, function, behavior, power, vision and values,[need quotation to verify] charisma, and intelligence, among others.

<font size=3>
In ancient Roman religion Victoria was the deified personification of victory. 　She first appears during the first Punic War, seemingly as a Romanised re-naming of Nike, the goddess of victory associated with Rome's Greek allies in the Greek mainland and in Magna Graecia. 　Thereafter she comes to symbolise Rome's eventual hegemony and right to rule. 　She is a deified abstraction, entitled to cult but unlike Nike, she has virtually no mythology of her own.

<font size=3>
In prehistoric archaeology, an avenue is a long, parallel-sided strip of land, measuring up to about 30m in width, open at either end, with edges marked by stone or timber alignments and/or a low earth bank and ditch. 　The term is used for such features all over the British Isles but they are concentrated in the centre and south of England. 　Most are either short and straight (Type I, less than 800m long), or long and curving (Type II, up to 2.5 km). 　It has been noted that they often link stone circles with rivers. 　They are a common element to Bronze Age ritual landscapes. 　Avenues are identified through their earthworks or using aerial archaeology, as their parallel features can be seen stretching over some distance. 　In most examples, it is the association of the avenue with other contemporary monuments that provides diagnosis. 　Avenues differ from cursus monuments, in that the latter also have earthworks at their terminal ends and have no upright stone or timber alignments. 　Avenues are thought to have been ceremonial or processional paths and to be of early Bronze Age date. 　They seem to have been used to indicate the intended route of approach to a particular monument. 　Examples in Britain include the Stonehenge Avenue, and Beckhampton Avenue and West Kennet Avenue at Avebury. 　An example in Ireland is the avenue going up the Hill of Tara.

Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. 　It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. 　Although people's attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences, most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. 　Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures and were supported in royal courts and developed into sophisticated forms, over time becoming available to all citizens. 　The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. 　Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. 　The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. 　This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. 　Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth. 　An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. 　The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. 　Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. 　Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. 　Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. 　Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days. 　Some entertainment, such as public executions, are now illegal in most countries. 　Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. 　In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. 　What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another. 　The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. 　This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime>Crime</a> 

<font size=3>
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. 　The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. 　The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. 　One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state ("a public wrong"). 　Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law. 　The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. 　What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each relevant jurisdiction. 　While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law nations no such comprehensive statute exists. 　The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. 　In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. 　If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, death. 　Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (mens rea). 　While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. 　Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia>Asia</a> 

<font size=3>
Asia (/ˈeɪʒə/ (listen), also UK: /ˈeɪʃə/) is a continent which is part of Eurasia. 　It is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population and shares the landmass of Afro-Eurasia with Europe and Africa. 　Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of Earth's total surface area. 　The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. 　Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined. 　In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. 　The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. 　It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. 　The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. 　A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe. 　China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. 　China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. 　The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. 　The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. 　Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. 　Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions. 　Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.　[citation needed] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. 　It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech>Speech</a> 

<font size=3>
Speech is a human vocal communication using language. 　Each language uses phonetic combinations of vowel and consonant sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as words in the lexicon of a language according to the syntactic constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. 　In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional speech acts, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use enunciation, intonation, degrees of loudness, tempo, and other non-representational or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization to convey meaning. 　In their speech, speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through accent), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychological states (emotions or moods), physico-psychological states (sobriety or drunkenness, normal consciousness and trance states), education or experience, and the like. 　Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people swear they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something. 　There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. 　People talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person. 　Solo speech can be used to memorize or to test one's memorization of things, and in prayer or in meditation (e.g., the use of a mantra). 　Researchers study many different aspects of speech: speech production and speech perception of the sounds used in a language, speech repetition, speech errors, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in children's enlargement of their vocabulary, and what different areas of the human brain, such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, underlie speech. 　Speech is the subject of study for linguistics, cognitive science, communication studies, psychology, computer science, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and acoustics. 　Speech compares with written language, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called diglossia. 　The evolutionary origins of speech are unknown and subject to much debate and speculation. 　While animals also communicate using vocalizations, and trained apes such as Washoe and Kanzi can use simple sign language, no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

<font size=3>
Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 　More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. 　Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence. 　Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence.

<font size=3>
Refused (also known as the Refused) is a Swedish hardcore punk band originating from Umeå and formed in 1991. 　Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzén, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandström, and bassist Magnus Flagge. 　Guitarist Jon Brännström was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. 　Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature and were for a time associated with the straight edge subculture. 　The band released their debut album This Just Might Be... the Truth in 1994. 　They followed this up with Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent (1996) and five EPs. 　In 1998, the band released The Shape of Punk to Come, which expanded their sound with jazz and electronic influences, but was initially poorly received commercially and critically. 　The group shortly after disbanded during their subsequent tour. 　Despite limited contemporary success, Refused were influential on the development of rock music in subsequent decades. 　In 2012, the band reformed and commenced a reunion tour, and later released further albums Freedom (2015) and War Music (2019).

<font size=3>
In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae. 　It contains the pharynx and larynx. 　An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs. 　The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. 　Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. 　The "throat" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces. 　It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body. 　Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat. 　It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube. 　The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs. 　The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach. 　Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue. 　The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat. 　The Jugulum is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast. 　The term Jugulum is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the Jugulum.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey>Hockey</a> 

<font size=3>
Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. 　While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal. 　There are many types of hockey. 　Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. 　In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey". 　In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 　Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead. 　The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. 　The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. 　The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. 　Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936. 　Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally referred to as hockey include Lacrosse, Hurling, Camogie and Shinty.

In sport, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. 　Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. 　A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. 　A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. 　A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial. 　Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. 　A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad.

<font size=3>
Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 　Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. 　A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist. 　Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. 　Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. 　Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. 　New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. 　Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. 　For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

<font size=3>
A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. 　It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. 　It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. 　In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion. 　Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. 　These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. 　Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs. 　They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. 　This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. 　Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. 　The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved. 　Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. 　This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. 　It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. 　The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. 　Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. 　The most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage.

Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 　With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. 　Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. 　Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). 　They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. 　The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. 　Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. 　The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. 　Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. 　Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 　6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago. 　Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. 　Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. 　In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. 　In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. 　Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. 　Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. 　Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm>Storm</a> 

<font size=3>
A storm is any disturbed state of the natural environment or the atmosphere of an astronomical body.　[citation needed] It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather. 　Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear. 　Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through. 　Heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise, such as skiing and snowmobiling. 　The English word comes from Proto-Germanic *sturmaz meaning "noise, tumult". 　Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with the system of high pressure surrounding it. 　This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. 　Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine>Medicine</a> 

<font size=3>
Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. 　Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. 　Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. 　Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. 　For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. 　In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). 　For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. 　Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine, and are thus called alternative medicine. 　Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean>Ocean</a> 

<font size=3>
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. 　An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. 　Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest). 　Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. 　The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. 　Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. 　Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. 　The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. 　The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. 　The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. 　This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. 　Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. 　Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. 　This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. 　Light penetrates to a depth of only a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. 　The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. 　Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. 　Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. 　In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). 　Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). 　Deep ocean temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean. 　Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents. 　These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity. 　Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves. 　Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 　Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe. 　This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean. 　Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 　This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. 　The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification. 　The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation. 　It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to food and other resources. 　Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species. 　However, the ocean is subject to numerous human-caused environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, and effects of climate change on oceans, such as ocean warming, ocean acidification, sea level rise and many more. 　The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting>Painting</a> 

<font size=3>
Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"[citation needed] or "support"). 　The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. 　In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). 　The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects. 　Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract art). 　Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism). 　A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. 　Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke>Duke</a> 

<font size=3>
Duke is a male title either of a monarch ruling over a duchy, or of a member of royalty, or nobility. 　As rulers, dukes are ranked below emperors, kings, grand princes, grand dukes, and sovereign princes. 　As royalty or nobility, they are ranked below princes and grand dukes. 　The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin dux, 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. 　In most countries, the word duchess is the female equivalent. 　Following the reforms of the emperor Diocletian (which separated the civilian and military administrations of the Roman provinces), a dux became the military commander in each province. 　The title dux, Hellenised to doux, survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it continued in several contexts, signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. 　Later on, in the 11th century, the title Megas Doux was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy. 　During the Middle Ages the title (as Herzog) signified first among the Germanic monarchies. 　Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. 　A duke may or may not be, ipso facto, a member of the nation's peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g. Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed. 　During the 19th century, many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by dukes or grand dukes. 　But at present, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. 　Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. 　In Sweden, members of the Royal Family are given a personal dukedom at birth. 　The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of duke or duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. 　In some realms the relative status of "duke" and "prince", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied—e.g., in Italy and Germany. 　A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is married to a duke, is normally styled duchess. 　Queen Elizabeth II, however, was known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.

<font size=3>
A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. 　The word is derived from the Latin name palātium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences. 　Most European languages have a version of the term (palais, palazzo, palacio, etc.), and many use it for a wider range of buildings than English. 　In many parts of Europe, the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities, especially of the aristocracy; often the term for a large country house is different. 　Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings. 　The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions such as a movie palace. 　A palace is distinguished from a castle while the latter clearly is fortified or has the style of a fortification, whereas a palace does not.

Nice (/niːs/ NEESS, French pronunciation: [nis] (listen); Niçard: Niça, classical norm, or Nissa, nonstandard, pronounced [ˈnisa]; Italian: Nizza [ˈnittsa]; Ligurian: Nissa; Ancient Greek: Νίκαια; Latin: Nicaea) is the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department in France. 　The Nice agglomeration extends far beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly 1 million on an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi). 　Located on the French Riviera, the southeastern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the French Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. 　Nice is approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. 　Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region. 　The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. 　The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. 　Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Νίκαια, Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. 　Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. 　Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. 　From 1388 it was a dominion of Savoy, then became part of the French First Republic between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the legal predecessor of the Kingdom of Italy, until its re-annexation by France in 1860. 　The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. 　In 1931, following its refurbishment the city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais ("Walkway of the English"), was inaugurated by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught; it owes its name to visitors to the resort. 　These included Queen Victoria along with her son Edward VII who spent winters there, as well as Henry Cavendish, born in Nice, who discovered hydrogen. 　The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman. 　Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts. 　International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. 　Frank Harris wrote several books including his autobiography My Life and Loves in Nice. 　Friedrich Nietzsche spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra here. 　Additionally, Russian writer Anton Chekhov completed his play Three Sisters while living in Nice. 　Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes. 　Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, heir apparent to Imperial Russia, died in Nice and was a patron of the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice where Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, morganatic wife of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia, is buried. 　Also buried there are General Dmitry Shcherbachev and General Nikolai Yudenich, leaders of the anti-Communist White Movement. 　Those interred at the Cimetière du Château include celebrated jeweler Alfred Van Cleef, Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, founder of the Mercedes car company, film director Louis Feuillade, poet Agathe-Sophie Sasserno, dancer Carolina Otero, Asterix comics creator René Goscinny, The Phantom of the Opera author Gaston Leroux, French prime minister Léon Gambetta, and the first president of the International Court of Justice José Gustavo Guerrero. 　Because of its historical importance as a winter resort town for the European aristocracy and the resulting mix of cultures found in the city, UNESCO proclaimed Nice a World Heritage Site in 2021. 　The city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country, and it is the second most visited metropolis in the hexagon, receiving 4 million tourists every year. 　It also has the third busiest airport in France, after the two main Parisian ones. 　It is the historical capital city of the County of Nice (French: Comté de Nice, Niçard: Countèa de Nissa).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel>Steel</a> 

<font size=3>
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. 　Many other elements may be present or added. 　Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium. 　Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, machines, electrical appliances, and weapons. 　Iron is the base metal of steel. 　Depending on the temperature, it can take two crystalline forms (allotropic forms): body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic. 　The interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. 　In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or soft and easily formed. 　In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations. 　The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. 　Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), impedes the movement of the dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. 　These qualities include the hardness, quenching behaviour, need for annealing, tempering behaviour, yield strength, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. 　The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility. 　Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel. 　This was followed by the open-hearth furnace and then the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century. 　With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. 　Mild steel replaced wrought iron. 　The German states saw major steel prowess over Europe in the 19th century. 　Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. 　Today, steel is one of the most commonly manufactured materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. 　Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organisations. 　The modern steel industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the world, but is one of the most energy and greenhouse gas emission intense industries, contributing 8% of global emissions. 　However, steel is also very reusable: it is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60% globally.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus>Bus</a> 

<font size=3>
A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van. 　It is most commonly used in public transport, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. 　Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. 　The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. 　Coaches are used for longer-distance services. 　Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. 　Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. 　In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence. 　Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles. 　Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. 　The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895. 　Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. 　As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world.

<font size=3>
A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. 　Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. 　However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. 　In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. 　Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. 　Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. 　Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. 　Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. 　House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. 　Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. 　Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions. 　Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats), wind (e.g. sailboats), and inboard/outboard motors (including gasoline, diesel, and electric).

<font size=3>
Rome City Centre Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city of Italy. 　It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. 　With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. 　The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. 　Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. 　Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. 　Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. 　Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City". 　Rome is generally considered to be the "cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture", and the centre of the Catholic Church. 　Rome's history spans 28 centuries. 　While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. 　The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. 　Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. 　It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. 　Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). 　After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. 　Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. 　In this way, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. 　Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. 　In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic. 　In 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. 　Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. 　The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 　The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international businesses, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. 　Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. 　The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.

<font size=3>
Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. 　In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. 　In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. 　In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestation and develops further in its mother's womb pouch. 　It is not only mammals that give birth. 　Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. 　Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.

<font size=3>
A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. 　A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. 　Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances. 　The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing). 　The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. 　The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world. 　Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. 　These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. 　For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. 　In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability. 　In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws. 　They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.　[citation needed]

Opera is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers. 　Such a "work" (the literal translation of the Italian word "opera") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. 　The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. 　Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another. 　Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. 　Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as Singspiel and Opéra comique. 　In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias. 　The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama. 　Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi, notably L'Orfeo, and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. 　In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. 　Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. 　The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), and The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), landmarks in the German tradition. 　The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style. 　It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber's introduction of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic Opera). 　The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany. 　The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. 　During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. 　The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). 　With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. 　Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. 　Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. 　Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(archaeology)>Survey (archaeology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In archaeology, survey or field survey is a type of field research by which archaeologists (often landscape archaeologists) search for archaeological sites and collect information about the location, distribution and organization of past human cultures across a large area (e.g. typically in excess of one hectare, and often in excess of many km2). 　Archaeologists conduct surveys to search for particular archaeological sites or kinds of sites, to detect patterns in the distribution of material culture over regions, to make generalizations or test hypotheses about past cultures, and to assess the risks that development projects will have adverse impacts on archaeological heritage. 　The surveys may be: 　(a) intrusive or non-intrusive, depending on the needs of the survey team (and the risk of destroying archaeological evidence if intrusive methods are used) and; 　(b) extensive or intensive, depending on the types of research questions being asked of the landscape in question. 　Surveys can be a practical way to decide whether or not to carry out an excavation (as a way of recording the basic details of a possible site), but may also be ends in themselves, as they produce important information about past human activities in a regional context. 　A common role of a field survey is in assessment of the potential archaeological significance of places where development is proposed. 　This is usually connected to construction work and road building. 　The assessment determines whether the area of development impact is likely to contain significant archaeological resources and makes recommendations as to whether the archaeological remains can be avoided or an excavation is necessary before development work can commence. 　Archaeologists use a variety of tools when carrying out surveys, including GIS, GPS, remote sensing, geophysical survey and aerial photography.

<font size=3>
Michigan (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/ (listen)) is a state in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwestern United States. 　With a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of nearly 97,000 sq mi (250,000 km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River. 　Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. 　Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. 　Its name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (mishigami), meaning "large water" or "large lake". 　Michigan consists of two peninsulas. 　The Lower Peninsula resembles the shape of a mitten, and comprises a majority of the state's land area. 　The Upper Peninsula (often called "the U.P.") is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile (8 km) channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. 　The Mackinac Bridge connects the peninsulas. 　Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the United States, being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair. 　It also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds. 　Michigan has the second-most water of any state, behind only Alaska. 　The area was first occupied by a succession of Native American tribes over thousands of years. 　In the 17th century, French explorers claimed it as part of the New France colony, when it was largely inhabited by indigenous peoples. 　French and Canadian traders and settlers, Métis, and others migrated to the area, settling largely along the waterways. 　After France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the region came under British rule. 　Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War. 　The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory. 　Michigan Territory was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after the War of 1812. 　Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a free one. 　It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region, attracting immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from many European countries. 　Immigrants from Finland, Macedonia, and the Netherlands were especially numerous. 　Migration from Appalachia and of Black Southerners as part of the Great Migration increased in the 1930s, with many settling in Metro Detroit. 　Although Michigan has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major national economic force. 　It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). 　Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism due to the abundance of natural resources. 　The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry.

<font size=3>
The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 　Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 　Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. 　Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. 　The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. 　Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. 　They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. 　Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. 　This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

<font size=3>
A chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. 　A chain may consist of two or more links. 　Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). 　Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types. 　Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. 　They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chains. 　Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis. 　Load can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper.

<font size=3>
The Internet (or internet) is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. 　It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 　The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. 　The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. 　The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s to enable resource sharing. 　The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. 　The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. 　Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life. 　Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. 　Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology or being reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. 　The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. 　Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. 　Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. 　The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. 　The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 　The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. 　In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven Wonders.

Faith, derived from Latin fides and Old French feid, is confidence or trust in a person, thing, or concept. 　In the context of religion, one can define faith as "belief in God or in the doctrines or teachings of religion". 　Religious people often think of faith as confidence based on a perceived degree of warrant, or evidence while others who are more skeptical of religion tend to think of faith as simply belief without evidence.

<font size=3>
Sydney (/ˈsɪdni/ (listen) SID-nee) is the capital city of the state of New South Wales, and the most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. 　Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 70 km (43.5 mi) towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north, the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west. 　Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. 　Residents of the city are known as "Sydneysiders". 　The 2021 census recorded the population of Greater Sydney as 5,231,150, meaning the city is home to approximately 66% of the state's population. 　Nicknames of the city include the 'Emerald City' and the 'Harbour City'. 　Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Greater Sydney region for at least 30,000 years, and Aboriginal engravings and cultural sites are common throughout Greater Sydney. 　The traditional custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora peoples. 　During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay. 　In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. 　After World War II, Sydney experienced mass migration and by 2021 over 40 per cent of the population was born overseas. 　Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are Mainland China, India, England, Vietnam and the Philippines. 　Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities in the world. 　It is classified as an Alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world. 　Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity, Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing and tourism. 　Established in 1850, the University of Sydney was Australia's first university and is regarded as one of the world's leading universities. 　Sydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics. 　The city is among the top fifteen most-visited cities in the world, with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city's landmarks. 　The city has over 1,000,000 ha (2,500,000 acres) of nature reserves and parks, and its notable natural features include Sydney Harbour and Royal National Park. 　The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the World Heritage-listed Sydney Opera House are major tourist attractions. 　Central Station is the hub of Sydney's rail network, and the main passenger airport serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the world's oldest continually operating airports.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate>Climate</a> 

<font size=3>
Climate is the long-term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years. 　More rigorously, it is the mean and variability of meteorological variables over a time spanning from months to millions of years. 　Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. 　In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere and the interactions between them. 　The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, longitude, terrain, altitude, land use and nearby water bodies and their currents. 　Climates can be classified according to the average and typical variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. 　The most widely used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. 　The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. 　Finally, the Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 　Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. 　Paleoclimatologists seek to explain climate variations for all parts of the Earth during any given geologic period, beginning with the time of the Earth's formation. 　Since very few direct observations of climate were available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables. 　They include non-biotic evidence—such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores—and biotic evidence—such as tree rings and coral. 　Climate models are mathematical models of past, present, and future climates. 　Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from various factors. 　Recent warming is discussed in global warming, which results in redistributions. 　For example, "a 3 °C [5 °F] change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km [190–250 mi] in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m [1,600 ft] in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones."

Ohio (/oʊˈhaɪoʊ/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　Of the fifty U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.8 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. 　The state's capital and largest city is Columbus, with the Columbus metro area, Greater Cincinnati, and Greater Cleveland being the largest metropolitan areas. 　Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. 　Ohio is historically known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes". 　Its state flag is the only non-rectangular flag of all the U.S. states. 　Ohio takes its name from the Ohio River, which in turn originated from the Seneca word ohiːyo', meaning "good river", "great river", or "large creek". 　The state arose from the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains that were contested from colonial times through the Northwest Indian Wars of the late 18th century. 　It was partitioned from the resulting Northwest Territory, which was the first frontier of the new United States, becoming the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance. 　Ohio was the first post-colonial free state admitted to the union and became one of the earliest and most influential industrial powerhouses during the 20th century. 　Although it has transitioned to a more information- and service-based economy in the 21st century, it remains an industrial state, ranking seventh in GDP as of 2019[update], with the third-largest manufacturing sector and second-largest automobile production. 　The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. 　Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives. 　The state is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections. 　Seven presidents of the United States have come from Ohio. 　This has led to it receiving the moniker "the Mother of Presidents".

<font size=3>
Jesus (c. 4 BC – AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth (among other names and titles), was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader; he is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. 　Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. 　Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically. 　Research into the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus, as the only detailed records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels. 　Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was circumcised, was baptized by John the Baptist, began his own ministry, and was often referred to as "rabbi". 　Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers. 　He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Jerusalem. 　After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church. 　Accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels. 　Christian theology includes the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. 　Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. 　The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead, either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. 　The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity; there is a small minority of Christian denominations that reject trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. 　The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on 25 December as Christmas. 　His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. 　The world's most widely used calendar era—in which the current year is AD 2023 (or 2023 CE)—is based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus. 　Jesus is also revered in Baha'i faith, Druze faith, Islam and Manichaeism. 　In Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ʿĪsā) is considered the penultimate prophet of God and the messiah, who will return before the Day of Judgement. 　Muslims believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary but was neither God nor a son of God. 　Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. 　In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.

<font size=3>
In political science, a revolution (Latin: revolutio, 'a turn around') is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which occurs when the population revolts against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic) or political incompetence. 　Revolutions have occurred throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. 　Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions, usually in response to perceived overwhelming autocracy or plutocracy. 　Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. 　Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in European history from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including sociology and political science. 　Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon. 　Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the creation of the United States through the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826), the European Revolutions of 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Chinese Revolution of the 1940s, the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the European Revolutions of 1989.
