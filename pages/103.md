Vermont (/vərˈmɒnt/ (listen)) is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　Vermont is bordered by the states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, and New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. 　Admitted to the union in 1791 as the 14th state, it is the only state in New England not bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. 　According to the 2020 U.S. census, the state has a population of 643,503, ranking it the second least-populated in the U.S. after Wyoming. 　It is also the nation's sixth-smallest state in area. 　The state's capital Montpelier is the least-populous state capital in the U.S., while its most-populous city, Burlington, is the least-populous to be a state's largest. 　For some 12,000 years, indigenous peoples have inhabited this area. 　The competitive tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active in the area at the time of European encounter. 　During the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France's colony of New France. 　After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. 　After being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain. 　Thereafter, the nearby British Thirteen Colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed the extent of the area called the New Hampshire Grants to the west of the Connecticut River, encompassing present-day Vermont. 　The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. 　The Green Mountain Boys militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York. 　Ultimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the Vermont Republic in 1777 as an independent state during the American Revolutionary War. 　The Vermont Republic abolished slavery before any of the other states. 　During the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of abolitionist sentiment, although it was also tied to King Cotton through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. 　It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the American Civil War. 　The geography of the state is marked by the Green Mountains, which run north–south up the middle of the state, separating Lake Champlain and other valley terrain on the west from the Connecticut River valley that defines much of its eastern border. 　A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. 　The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. 　Vermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked last on the list of U.S. states and territories by GDP but 34th in GDP per capita. 　In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples. 　As of 2014[update], the state ranked 14th on the American Human Development Index.

<font size=3>
Spectroscopy is the field of study that measures and interprets the electromagnetic spectra that result from the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation. 　Matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of radiative energy, and recently gravitational waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　Historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of the wavelength dependence of the absorption by gas phase matter of visible light dispersed by a prism. 　Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental exploratory tool in the fields of astronomy, chemistry, materials science, and physics, allowing the composition, physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be investigated at the atomic, molecular and macro scale, and over astronomical distances. 　Important applications include biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition>Ammunition</a> 
<font size=3>
Ammunition is the material fired, scattered, dropped, or detonated from any weapon or weapon system. 　Ammunition is both expendable weapons (e.g., bombs, missiles, grenades, land mines) and the component parts of other weapons that create the effect on a target (e.g., bullets and warheads). 　The purpose of ammunition is to project a force against a selected target to have an effect (usually, but not always, lethal). 　An example of ammunition is the firearm cartridge, which includes all components required to deliver the weapon effect in a single package. 　Until the 20th century, black powder was the most common propellant used but has now been replaced in nearly all cases by modern compounds. 　Ammunition comes in a great range of sizes and types and is often designed to work only in specific weapons systems. 　However, there are internationally recognized standards for certain ammunition types (e.g., 5.56×45mm NATO) that enable their use across different weapons and by different users. 　There are also specific types of ammunition that are designed to have a specialized effect on a target, such as armor-piercing shells and tracer ammunition, used only in certain circumstances. 　Ammunition is commonly labeled or colored in a specific manner to assist in its identification and to prevent the wrong ammunition types from being used accidentally or inappropriately.

<font size=3>
A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system. 　Axons transmit electrical impulses. 　Nerves have historically been considered the basic units of the peripheral nervous system. 　A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. 　Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin. 　Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. 　The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium. 　Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium. 　Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves. 　In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.

<font size=3>
A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op, or coop) is "an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise". 　Cooperatives are democratically controlled by their members, with each member having one vote in electing the board of directors.　[citation needed] Cooperatives may include: businesses owned and managed by the people who consume their goods and/or services (a consumer cooperative) businesses where producers pool their output for their common benefit (a producer cooperative) organizations managed by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) businesses where members pool their purchasing power (a purchasing cooperative) multi-stakeholder or hybrid cooperatives that share ownership between different stakeholder groups. 　For example, care cooperatives where ownership is shared between both care-givers and receivers. 　Stakeholders might also include non-profits or investors. 　second- and third-tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives platform cooperatives that use a cooperatively owned and governed website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services. 　Research published by the Worldwatch Institute found that in 2012 approximately one billion people in 96 countries had become members of at least one cooperative. 　The turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion. 　Cooperative businesses are typically more productive and economically resilient than many other forms of enterprise, with twice the number of co-operatives (80%) surviving their first five years compared with other business ownership models (41%) according to data from United Kingdom. 　The largest worker owned cooperative in the world, the Mondragon Corporation (founded by Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta), has been in continuous operation since 1956. 　Cooperatives frequently have social goals, which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. 　As an example of this, in 2013, retail co-operatives in the UK invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade as compared with 2.4% for other rival supermarkets. 　Since 2002, cooperatives have been distinguishable on the Internet through the use of a .　coop domain. 　In 2014, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) introduced the Cooperative Marque, meaning ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions can also be identified through a coop ethical consumerism label.

<font size=3>
Ico (イコ, Iko, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions. 　It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept. 　Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. 　The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion. 　The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. 　Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. 　During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. 　The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. 　Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadowy creatures that attempt to draw her back. 　Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles. 　Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, bloom lighting, and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. 　Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. 　Considered a cult classic, it has been called one of the greatest video games of all time, and is often brought up in discussions about video games as an art form. 　It has influenced numerous video games since its release. 　It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. 　A high-definition remaster of the game was released alongside Shadow of the Colossus for the PlayStation 3 in The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection in 2011.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda>Amanda</a> 
<font size=3>
Amanda is a Latin feminine gerundive (i.e. verbal adjective) name meaning, literally, “she who must (or is fit to) be loved”. 　Other translations, with similar meaning, could be "deserving to be loved," "worthy of love," or "loved very much by everyone." 　Its diminutive form includes Mandy, Manda and Amy. 　It is common in countries where Germanic and Romance languages are spoken. 　"Amanda" comes from ama- (the stem of the Latin verb amare, "to love") plus the feminine nominative singular gerundive ending (-nda). 　Other names, especially female names, were derived from this verb form, such as “Miranda”. 　The name "Amanda" occasionally appears in Late Antiquity, such as the Amanda who was the 'wife of the ex-advocate and ex-provincial governor Aper (q.v.); she cared for his estates and raised their children after he adopted the monastic life: "curat illa saeculi curas, ne tu cures”' [Paul. Nol. Epist. 44.4]. In England the name "Amanda" first appears in 1212 on a birth record from Warwickshire, England, and five centuries later the name was popularized by poets and playwrights. In the United States, "Amanda" slowly became more prominent from the 1930s to the 1960s, ranking among the top 200 baby names. From 1976 to 1995, "Amanda" ranked in the ten most popular female baby names in the United States. The name was most popular from 1978 to 1992, when it ranked in the top four.[citation needed] At its prime, in 1980, it was the second most popular. In 2009, "Amanda" ranked number 166. 　It was ranked among the top ten names given to girls born in Puerto Rico in 2009. 　The name has also recently been popular in Sweden, where it ranked twentieth for girls born in 2009, down five places from the year 2008. 　It is also popular in Swedish-speaking families in Finland, where it ranked among the top ten names for girls born to this demographic group.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
A barn is an agricultural building usually on farms and used for various purposes. 　In North America, a barn refers to structures that house livestock, including cattle and horses, as well as equipment and fodder, and often grain. 　As a result, the term barn is often qualified e.g. tobacco barn, dairy barn, cow house, sheep barn, potato barn. 　In the British Isles, the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for unthreshed cereals and fodder, the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters, whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables. 　In mainland Europe, however, barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings (or housebarns in US literature). 　In addition, barns may be used for equipment storage, as a covered workplace, and for activities such as threshing.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient>Coefficient</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series, or an expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression (including variables such as a, b and c).　[better source needed] When the coefficients are themselves variables, they may also be called parameters. 　For example, the polynomial 2 x 2 − x + 3 {\displaystyle 2x^{2}-x+3} has coefficients 2, −1, and 3, and the powers of the variable x {\displaystyle x} in the polynomial a x 2 + b x + c {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c} have coefficient parameters a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} , and c {\displaystyle c} . 　The constant coefficient (or constant term) is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. 　For example, the constant coefficients of the expressions above are the number 3 and the parameter c, respectively. 　The coefficient attached to the highest degree of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the leading coefficient. 　For example, in the expressions above, the leading coefficients are 2 and a, respectively. 　In the context of differential equations, an equation can often be written as equating to zero a polynomial in the unknown functions and their derivatives. 　In this case, the coefficients of the differential equation are the coefficients of this polynomial, and are generally non-constant functions. 　A coefficient is a constant coefficient when it is a constant function. 　For avoiding confusion, the coefficient that is not attached to unknown functions and their derivative is generally called the constant term rather the constant coefficient. 　In particular, in a linear differential equation with constant coefficient, the constant term is generally not supposed to be a constant function.

<font size=3>
Epsilon (/ˈɛpsɪlɒn/, UK also /ɛpˈsaɪlən/; uppercase Ε, lowercase ε or lunate ϵ; Greek: έψιλον) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel IPA: [e̞] or IPA: [ɛ̝]. 　In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. 　It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . 　Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э. 　The name of the letter was originally εἶ (Ancient Greek: [êː]), but it was later changed to ἒ ψιλόν (e psilon 'simple e') in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph αι, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon. 　The uppercase form of epsilon is identical to Latin E but has its own code point in Unicode: U+0395 Ε GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON. 　The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. 　One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed number "3" and is encoded U+03B5 ε GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON. 　The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing, looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar: it is encoded U+03F5 ϵ GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL. 　While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols: computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. 　In TeX, \epsilon ( ϵ {\displaystyle \epsilon \!　} ) denotes the lunate form, while \varepsilon ( ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon \!　} ) denotes the reversed-3 form. 　There is also a 'Latin epsilon', ɛ or "open e", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. 　It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B ɛ LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E and U+0190 Ɛ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OPEN E and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. 　The lunate or uncial epsilon provided inspiration for the euro sign, €. 　The lunate epsilon, ϵ, is not to be confused with the set membership symbol ∈; nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon, Ɛ, be confused with the Greek uppercase Σ (sigma). 　The symbol ∈ {\displaystyle \in } , first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership ("belongs to") evolved from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word est. 　In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol ∈ as "element of", as in "1 is an element of the natural numbers" for 1 ∈ N {\displaystyle 1\in \mathbb {N} } , for example. 　As late as 1960, ε itself was used for set membership, while its negation "does not belong to" (now ∉) was denoted by ε' (epsilon prime). 　Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role. 　In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, ϶, for the phrase "such that", although the abbreviation s.t. is occasionally used in place of ϶ in informal cardinals.

<font size=3>
A membrane is a selective barrier; it allows some things to pass through but stops others. 　Such things may be molecules, ions, or other small particles. 　Membranes can be generally classified into synthetic membranes and biological membranes. 　Biological membranes include cell membranes (outer coverings of cells or organelles that allow passage of certain constituents); nuclear membranes, which cover a cell nucleus; and tissue membranes, such as mucosae and serosae. 　Synthetic membranes are made by humans for use in laboratories and industry (such as chemical plants). 　This concept of a membrane has been known since the eighteenth century but was used little outside of the laboratory until the end of World War II. 　Drinking water supplies in Europe had been compromised by the war and membrane filters were used to test for water safety. 　However, due to the lack of reliability, slow operation, reduced selectivity and elevated costs, membranes were not widely exploited. 　The first use of membranes on a large scale was with microfiltration and ultrafiltration technologies. 　Since the 1980s, these separation processes, along with electrodialysis, are employed in large plants and, today, several experienced companies serve the market. 　The degree of selectivity of a membrane depends on the membrane pore size. 　Depending on the pore size, they can be classified as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. 　Membranes can also be of various thickness, with homogeneous or heterogeneous structure. 　Membranes can be neutral or charged, and particle transport can be active or passive. 　The latter can be facilitated by pressure, concentration, chemical or electrical gradients of the membrane process.

<font size=3>
A referendum (plural: referendums or referenda) is a direct vote by the electorate on a proposal, law, or political issue. 　This is in contrast to an issue being voted on by a representative. 　This may result in the adoption of a new policy or specific law, or the referendum may be only advisory. 　In some countries, it is synonymous with and also known as plebiscite, votation, popular consultation, ballot question, ballot measure, or proposition. 　Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. 　The word, 'referendum' is often a catchall, used for both legislative referrals and initiatives.

<font size=3>
A gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. 　Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. 　Gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention. 　Gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak. 　Gesticulation and speech work independently of each other, but join to provide emphasis and meaning. 　Gesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are used by speech and sign language. 　In fact, language is thought by some scholars to have evolved in Homo sapiens from an earlier system consisting of manual gestures. 　The theory that language evolved from manual gestures, termed Gestural Theory, dates back to the work of 18th-century philosopher and priest Abbé de Condillac, and has been revived by contemporary anthropologist Gordon W. Hewes, in 1973, as part of a discussion on the origin of language.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit>Habit</a> 
<font size=3>
A habit (or wont as a humorous and formal term) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. 　The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience." 　Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. 　Habits are sometimes compulsory. 　A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. 　New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. 　Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition. 　When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. 　This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. 　Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency; lack of awareness; unintentionality; and uncontrollability.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestion>Suggestion</a> 
<font size=3>
Suggestion is the psychological process by which a person guides their own or another person's desired thoughts, feelings, and behaviors by presenting stimuli that may elicit them as reflexes instead of relying on conscious effort. 　Nineteenth-century writers on psychology such as William James used the words "suggest" and "suggestion" in the context of a particular idea which was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind. 　Early scientific studies of hypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (Hull, 1933). 　The original neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideomotor reflex response that William B. Carpenter declared, in 1852, was the principle through which James Braid's hypnotic phenomena were produced.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy>Fairy</a> 
<font size=3>
A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural. 　Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources. 　Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature. 　The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. 　At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. 　Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". 　It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy. 　A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms. 　Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food. 　Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps. 　Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities. 　In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. 　The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
