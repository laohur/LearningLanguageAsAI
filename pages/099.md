## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult>Cult</a> 
<font size=3>
In Modern English, cult is a term, considered pejorative by some, for a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals, or its common interest in a particular personality, object, or goal. 　This sense of the term is controversial and weakly defined, – having divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia – and has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.　: 348–356  An older sense of the word involves a set of religious devotional practices that is conventional within its culture, is related to a particular figure, and is frequently associated with a particular place. 　References to the "cult" of a particular Catholic saint, or references to the imperial cult of ancient Rome, for example, use the word in this sense. 　While the word is still being used in its literal and original sense, a derived sense of "excessive devotion" arose in the 19th century. 　Then, beginning in the 1930s, cults became an object of sociological study within the context of the study of religious behavior. 　Since the 1940s, the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements, labeling them "cults" because of their unorthodox beliefs. 　Since the 1970s, the secular anti-cult movement has opposed certain groups and, as a reaction to acts of violence, frequently charged those cults with practicing mind control. 　Scholars and the media have disputed some of the claims and actions of anti-cult movements, leading to further public controversy. 　Sociological classifications of religious movements may identify a cult as a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. 　Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults, saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. 　Groups labelled as "cults" range in size from local groups with a few followers to international organizations with millions of adherents.

<font size=3>
An atom is a particle that consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons. 　The atom is the basic particle of the chemical elements, and the chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. 　For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. 　The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. 　Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. 　A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. 　This is smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. 　Atoms are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects. 　More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. 　The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. 　If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. 　If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively – such atoms are called ions. 　The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. 　The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force. 　This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. 　Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. 　In this case, the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements. 　This is a form of nuclear decay. 　Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals. 　The ability of atoms to attach and detach is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. 　Chemistry is the discipline that studies these changes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favourite>Favourite</a> 
<font size=3>
A favourite (British English) or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. 　In post-classical and early-modern Europe, among other times and places, the term was used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. 　It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. 　From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, particularly in Spain, England, France and Sweden. 　The term is also sometimes employed by writers who want to avoid terms such as "royal mistress", "friend", "companion", or "lover" (of any gender). 　Several favourites had sexual relations with the monarch (or the monarch's spouse), but the feelings of the monarch for the favourite ran the gamut from simple faith in the favourite's abilities to various degrees of emotional affection and dependence, and sometimes even encompassed sexual infatuation. 　The term has an inbuilt element of disapproval and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "One who stands unduly high in the favour of a prince", citing Shakespeare: "Like favourites/ Made proud by Princes" (Much Ado about Nothing, 3.1.9).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher>Philosopher</a> 
<font size=3>
A philosopher is a person who practices or investigates philosophy. 　The term philosopher comes from the Ancient Greek: φιλόσοφος, romanized: philosophos, meaning 'lover of wisdom'. 　The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BCE). 　In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing upon resolving existential questions about the human condition; it was not necessary that they discoursed upon theories or commented upon authors. 　Those who most arduously committed themselves to this lifestyle would have been considered philosophers. 　In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who contributes to one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of science, logic, metaphysics, social theory, philosophy of religion, and political philosophy. 　A philosopher may also be someone who has worked in the humanities or other sciences which over the centuries have split from philosophy, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet>Hamlet</a> 
<font size=3>
The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (/ˈhæmlɪt/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. 　It is Shakespeare's longest play, with 29,551 words. 　Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. 　Hamlet is considered among the "most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language", with a story capable of "seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others". 　There are many works that have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare's play—from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan plays. 　The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of "source hunting", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. 　When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. 　This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, and printed in Paris in 1514. 　The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. 　It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's Hamlet, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. 　Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after Hamlet had been written, though it's possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version. 　Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). 　Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.

A doctorate (from Latin docere, "to teach"), doctor's degree (from Latin doctor, "teacher"), or doctoral degree is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities and some other educational institutions, derived from the ancient formalism licentia docendi ("licence to teach"). 　In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. 　There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines. 　In the United States and some other countries, there are also some types of technical or professional degrees that include "doctor" in their name and are classified as a doctorate in some of those countries. 　Professional doctorates historically came about to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines. 　Many universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or other contributions to the university or society.

<font size=3>
Ghana (/ˈɡɑːnə/ (listen); Twi: Gaana, Ewe: Gana), officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa. 　It abuts the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, sharing borders with Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, and Togo in the east. 　Ghana covers an area of 238,535 km2 (92,099 sq mi), spanning diverse biomes that range from coastal savannas to tropical rainforests. 　With nearly 31 million inhabitants (according to the 2021[update] census), Ghana is the second-most populous country in West Africa, after Nigeria. 　The capital and largest city is Accra; other major cities are Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi. 　The first permanent state in present-day Ghana was the Bono state of the 11th century. 　Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful were the Kingdom of Dagbon in the north and the Ashanti Empire in the south. 　Beginning in the 15th century, the Portuguese Empire, followed by numerous other European powers, contested the area for trading rights, until the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century. 　Following over a century of colonisation, Ghana's current borders took shape, encompassing four separate British colonial territories: Gold Coast, Ashanti, the Northern Territories, and British Togoland. 　These were unified as an independent dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations on 6 March 1957, becoming the first colony in West Africa to achieve sovereignty. 　Ghana subsequently became influential in decolonisation efforts and the Pan-African movement. 　Ghana is a multi-ethnic country with a diverse population, linguistic and religious groups; while the Akan are the largest ethnic group, they constitute only a plurality. 　Most Ghanaians are Christians (71.3%); almost a fifth are Muslims; a tenth practise traditional faiths or report no religion. 　Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is both head of state and head of government. 　Ghana has maintained since 1993 one of the freest and most stable governments on the continent, and it performs relatively well in healthcare, economic growth, and human development, so that it has a significant influence in West Africa and is highly integrated in international affairs, being a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, African Union, Economic Community of West African States, Group of 24, and Commonwealth of Nations.

<font size=3>
A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light beam by means of refraction. 　A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. 　Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic and are ground, polished, or molded to the required shape. 　A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. 　Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called "lenses", such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses. 　Lenses are used in various imaging devices like telescopes, binoculars, and cameras. 　They are also used as visual aids in glasses to correct defects of vision such as myopia and hypermetropia.

<font size=3>
In hydrology, a lens, also called freshwater lens or Ghyben-Herzberg lens, is a convex-shaped layer of fresh groundwater that floats above the denser saltwater and is usually found on small coral or limestone islands and atolls. 　This aquifer of fresh water is recharged through precipitation that infiltrates the top layer of soil and percolates downward until it reaches the saturated zone. 　The recharge rate of the lens can be summarized by the following equation: R = p − E T {\displaystyle R=p-ET} Where R {\displaystyle R} is the recharge rate in meters, p {\displaystyle p} is precipitation (m), and E T {\displaystyle ET} is evapotranspiration (m) of water. 　With higher amounts of recharge, the hydraulic head is increased, and a thick freshwater lens is maintained through the dry season. 　Lower rates of precipitation or higher rates of interception and evapotranspiration will decrease the hydraulic head, resulting in a thin lens.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(geology)>Lens (geology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In geology, a lens or lentil is a body of ore or rock that is thick in the middle and thin at the edges, resembling a convex lens in cross-section. 　To thin out in all directions is to "lens out", also known as "lensing". 　The adjectives "lenticular" and "lentiform" are used to describe lens-like formations. 　Lenticle is a synonym for lentil, but may also refer to a fragment of rock that is lens-shaped. 　"Lenticule" is used for small lentil. 　A lentil may also refer a minor unit in a formation of rock, similar to a member but not generally spread out over a large geographical area. 　In this usage, the lentil thins out towards its edges. 　Lenticular bedding is a special form of rock interbedded mudrock and cross-laminated rippled sandstone. 　The lenses or ripples in lenticular beds are discontinuous in all directions.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape>Rape</a> 
<font size=3>
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without their consent. 　The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent. 　The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault. 　The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. 　Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median. 　Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females. 　Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape. 　Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. 　These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. 　Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. 　People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop post-traumatic stress disorder. 　Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. 　A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, sometimes, from the victim's family and relatives.

Acceptance in human psychology is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it or protest it. 　The concept is close in meaning to acquiescence, derived from the Latin acquiēscere (to find rest in).

<font size=3>
An arrow is a fin-stabilized projectile launched by a bow. 　A typical arrow usually consists of a long, stiff, straight shaft with a weighty (and usually sharp and pointed) arrowhead attached to the front end, multiple fin-like stabilizers called fletchings mounted near the rear, and a slot at the rear end called a nock for engaging the bowstring. 　A container or bag carrying additional arrows for convenient reloading is called a quiver. 　The use of bows and arrows by humans predates recorded history and is common to most cultures. 　A craftsman who makes arrows is a fletcher, and one that makes arrowheads is an arrowsmith.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_(mythology)>Shade (mythology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In poetry and literature, a shade (translating Greek σκιά, Latin umbra) is the spirit or ghost of a dead person, residing in the underworld. 　An underworld where the dead live in shadow was common to beliefs in the ancient Near East. 　In Biblical Hebrew, it was called tsalmaveth (צַלמָוֶת: lit. "death-shadow", "shadow of death") as an alternate term for Sheol. 　The Witch of Endor in the First Book of Samuel notably conjures the ghost (owb) of Samuel. 　Only select individuals were believed to be exempt from the fate of dwelling in shadow after death. 　They would instead ascend to the divine sphere, as is reflected in the veneration of heroes. 　Plutarch relates how Alexander the Great was inconsolable after the death of Hephaistion up to the moment he received an oracle of Ammon confirming that the deceased was a hero, i.e. enjoyed the status of a divinity. 　Shades appear in Book Eleven of Homer's Odyssey, when Odysseus descends into Hades, and in Book Six of Virgil's Aeneid, when Aeneas travels to the underworld. 　In the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, many of the dead are similarly referred to as shades (Italian ombra), including Dante's guide, Virgil. 　The phrase "peace to thy gentle shade [and endless rest]" is sometimes seen in epitaphs, and was used by Alexander Pope in his epitaph for Nicholas Rowe.

<font size=3>
A fence is a structure that encloses an area, typically outdoors, and is usually constructed from posts that are connected by boards, wire, rails or netting. 　A fence differs from a wall in not having a solid foundation along its whole length. 　Alternatives to fencing include a ditch (sometimes filled with water, forming a moat).
