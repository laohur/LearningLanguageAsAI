"Appears" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. 　It was released by Avex Trax on November 10, 1999 as the sixth single from her second studio album Loveppears (1999), which was released on the same day. 　Alongside this, it has been released in several other territories with different release dates under her Western alias Ayu. 　It also served as Hamasaki's first limited edition single, limiting physical sales to 300,000 copies. 　The track was written by Hamasaki herself, while production was handled by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura. 　Musically, "Appears" is a dance song written in third person perspective, and is about the third person watching what appears to be a happy and loving relationship. 　Upon its release, "Appears" received positive reviews from music critics. 　Alexey Eremenko, writing for AllMusic, selected the track as the best song from the album and her career. 　However, an editor from CD Journal criticized the amount of remixes on the CD single. 　Commercially, the single was a success in Japan, peaking at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and TBS' Count Down TV chart. 　It sold just below its restricted 300,000 units, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 200,000 units. 　An accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, which displays Hamasaki walking around New York City and observing people. 　To promote the single, it appeared on several remix and greatest hits compilation albums conducted by Hamasaki, and has been included on some of her concert tours, including part two of her 2000 concert tour and the 2007 Secret Tour.

<font size=3>
A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles and techniques to communicate ideas. 　Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. 　Writers' texts are published across a wide range of media. 　Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. 　The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone "writer" typically refers to the creation of written language. 　Some writers work from an oral tradition. 　Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. 　Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. 　Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. 　Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing. 　In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words. 　As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about how they write (their writing process); why they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism). 　Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. 　Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.　[citation needed] The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. 　Author most often refers to the writer of a book.

<font size=3>
A navy, naval force, or maritime force is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. 　It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields. 　The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). 　The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. 　The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 　Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density>Density</a> 
<font size=3>
Density (volumetric mass density or specific mass) is the substance's mass per unit of volume. 　The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. 　Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: ρ = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. 　In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. 　For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. 　Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. 　Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. 　To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity "relative density" or "specific gravity", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. 　Thus a relative density less than one relative to water means that the substance floats in water. 　The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. 　This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. 　Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. 　Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. 　In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid, which causes it to rise relative to denser unheated material. 　The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. 　Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass. 　Other conceptually comparable quantities or ratios include specific density, relative density (specific gravity), and specific weight.

<font size=3>
Silver is a chemical element with the symbol Ag (from the Latin argentum, derived from the Proto-Indo-European h₂erǵ: "shiny" or "white") and atomic number 47. 　A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. 　The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. 　Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. 　Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. 　Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. 　Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". 　As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures. 　Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term "silverware"), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized confectionery. 　Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film. 　Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.

Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. 　In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. 　"Psychological peace" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined, yet often a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioural peace." 　Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition." 　Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life. 　The acquisition of such a "peaceful internal disposition" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests. 　Peace is not a state of excitement although we are happy when excited, but peace is when one's mind is quiet and satisfied.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave>Wave</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities. 　Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some frequency. 　When the entire waveform moves in one direction, it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave. 　In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero. 　Waves are often described by a wave equation (standing wave field of two opposite waves) or a one-way wave equation for single wave propagation in a defined direction. 　Two types of waves are most commonly studied in classical physics. 　In a mechanical wave, stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. 　A mechanical wave is a local deformation (strain) in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too. 　For example, sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium. 　Other examples of mechanical waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations, and vortices. 　In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations. 　Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent). 　Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays. 　Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity; heat diffusion waves; plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction–diffusion waves, such as in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more. 　Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer energy, momentum, and information, but they do not transfer particles in the medium. 　In mathematics and electronics waves are studied as signals. 　On the other hand, some waves have envelopes which do not move at all such as standing waves (which are fundamental to music) and hydraulic jumps. 　Some, like the probability waves of quantum mechanics, may be completely static[dubious – discuss]. 　A physical wave field is almost always confined to some finite region of space, called its domain. 　For example, the seismic waves generated by earthquakes are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet, so they can be ignored outside it. 　However, waves with infinite domain, that extend over the whole space, are commonly studied in mathematics, and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains. 　A plane wave is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any (infinite) plane normal to a specific direction of travel. 　Mathematically, the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency. 　In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and/or different frequencies. 　A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or longitudinal wave if those vectors are aligned with the propagation direction. 　Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids (such as air) can only be longitudinal. 　That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave's polarization, which can be an important attribute.

<font size=3>
A municipality is usually a single administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate. 　The term municipality may also mean the governing body of a given municipality. 　A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. 　The term is derived from French municipalitécode: fra promoted to code: fr and Latin municipaliscode: lat promoted to code: la . 　The English word municipality derives from the Latin social contract municipiumcode: lat promoted to code: la (derived from a word meaning "duty holders"), referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy). 　A municipality can be any political jurisdiction, from a sovereign state such as the Principality of Monaco, to a small village such as West Hampton Dunes, New York. 　The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass only one populated place such as a city, town, or village several such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the U.S. state of New Jersey (1798–1899) as townships governing several villages, municipalities of Mexico, municipalities of Colombia) only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city, such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught>Caught</a> 
<font size=3>
Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in cricket. 　A batsman is out caught if the batsman hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery, with the bat, and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground. 　If the ball hits the stumps after hitting the wicket-keeper, If the wicket-keeper fails to do this, the delivery is a "no ball", and the batsman cannot be stumped (nor run out, unless he attempts to run to the other wicket.) If the catch taken by the wicket-keeper,then informally it is known as caught behind or caught at the wicket. 　A catch by the bowler is known as caught and bowled. 　This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player. 　(The scorecard annotation is usually 　c. and 　b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name.　) Caught is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition, accounting for 36,190 Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012, which is 56.9% of all Test match dismissals in this period. 　South African wicket-keeper Mark Boucher holds the record for the most Test match catches, with 532, while Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most Test match catches by non-wicket-keepers, with 210.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire>Empire</a> 
<font size=3>
An empire is a political unit made up of several territories and peoples, "usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries". 　The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) exercises political control over the peripheries. 　Within an empire, different populations have different sets of rights and are governed differently. 　Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state is an emperor; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples). 　There have been "ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign" Empires. 　An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, which include territories that are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the Carthaginian Empire and British Empire. 　Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). 　The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. 　Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance>Dance</a> 
<font size=3>
Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. 　Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. 　An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. 　Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics. 　Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. 　Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing competitions found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards. 　Dance requires an equal amount of cognitive focus as well as physical strength. 　The demanding yet evolving art-form allows individuals to express themselves creatively through movement, while enabling them to adapt movement that possesses a rhythmical pattern and fluid motions that allure to an audience either onstage or on film. 　Dance is considered to be a very aesthetically pleasing art-form.

<font size=3>
Pay is an expression used in hydrocarbon mining. 　It denotes a portion of a reservoir that contains economically recoverable hydrocarbons. 　The term derives from the possibility of "paying" an income surpassing the costs. 　Equivalent terms are pay sand or pay zone. 　Overall interval in which pay volumes occur is the gross pay; smaller portions of the reservoir that meet further criteria for pay (such as permeability and hydrocarbon saturation) are net pay. 　Net pay is determined through placing cut offs on properties like permeability, porosity, water saturation or volume of shale. 　Care needs to be taken to cut out the part of the gross rock volume that has the ability to allow fluids to flow and actually stores hydrocarbons. 　In other cases when determining "Net Reservoir" the remaining rock is that rock that can still store flow hydrocarbons but is not necessary containing hydrocarbons. 　When the cut off is based on the ability of the rock to store hydrocarbons this is called "Net Rock".

<font size=3>
A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the exchange of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. 　Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window. 　Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. 　Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts. 　In addition to this, many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh, often made of aluminum or fibreglass, to keep bugs out when the window is opened. 　Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, Rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows. 　The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria c. 　100 AD. 　Presentations of windows can be seen in ancient Egyptian wall art and sculptures from Assyria. 　Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan. 　In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century. 　In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups. 　Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(geology)>Window (geology)</a> 
<font size=3>
A tectonic window, or fenster (lit. "window" in German), is a geologic structure formed by erosion or normal faulting on a thrust system. 　In such a system the rock mass (hanging wall block) that has been transported by movement along the thrust is called a nappe. 　When erosion or normal faulting produces a hole in the nappe where the underlying autochthonous (i.e. un-transported) rocks crop out this is called a window. 　Klippen are also a feature near windows. 　The klippe is the remnant portion of a nappe after erosion has removed connecting portions of the nappe. 　This process results in an outlier of exotic, often nearly horizontally translated strata overlying autochthonous strata. 　Windows can be almost any size, from a couple of metres to hundreds of kilometres. 　Well known examples of tectonic windows are Hohe Tauern window in Eastern Alps or Hrzdavá dolina tectonic window in Western Carpathians. 　Look up autochthonous in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
