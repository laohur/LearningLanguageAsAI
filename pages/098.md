<font size=3>
In dynamical systems instability means that some of the outputs or internal states increase with time, without bounds. 　Not all systems that are not stable are unstable; systems can also be marginally stable or exhibit limit cycle behavior. 　In structural engineering, a structural beam or column can become unstable when excessive compressive load is applied. 　Beyond a certain threshold, structural deflections magnify stresses, which in turn increases deflections. 　This can take the form of buckling or crippling. 　The general field of study is called structural stability. 　Atmospheric instability is a major component of all weather systems on Earth.

<font size=3>
Imprisonment is the restraint of a person's liberty, for any cause whatsoever, whether by authority of the government, or by a person acting without such authority. 　In the latter case it is "false imprisonment". 　Imprisonment does not necessarily imply a place of confinement, with bolts and bars, but may be exercised by any use or display of force (such as placing one in handcuffs), lawfully or unlawfully, wherever displayed, even in the open street. 　People become prisoners, wherever they may be, by the mere word or touch of a duly authorized officer directed to that end. 　Usually, however, imprisonment is understood to imply an actual confinement in a jail or prison employed for the purpose according to the provisions of the law. 　Sometimes gender imbalances occur in imprisonment rates, with incarceration of males proportionately more likely than incarceration of females.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtually>Virtually</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra that studies infinite groups, the adverb virtually is used to modify a property so that it need only hold for a subgroup of finite index. 　Given a property P, the group G is said to be virtually P if there is a finite index subgroup H ≤ G {\displaystyle H\leq G} such that H has property P. Common uses for this would be when P is abelian, nilpotent, solvable or free. 　For example, virtually solvable groups are one of the two alternatives in the Tits alternative, while Gromov's theorem states that the finitely generated groups with polynomial growth are precisely the finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups. 　This terminology is also used when P is just another group. 　That is, if G and H are groups then G is virtually H if G has a subgroup K of finite index in G such that K is isomorphic to H. In particular, a group is virtually trivial if and only if it is finite. 　Two groups are virtually equal if and only if they are commensurable.

Solomon (/ˈsɒləmən/; Hebrew: שְׁלֹמֹה‎, Modern: Šlōmō, Tiberian: Šălōmō, lit. 'peaceful'), also called Jedidiah (Hebrew: יְדִידְיָהּ‎, Modern: Yǝdīdǝyah, Tiberian: Yăḏīḏăyāh, "beloved of Yah"), was a monarch of ancient Israel and the son and successor of David, according to the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament. 　He is described as having been the penultimate ruler of an amalgamated Israel and Judah. 　The hypothesized dates of Solomon's reign are 970–931 BCE. 　After his death, his son and successor Rehoboam would adopt harsh policy towards the northern tribes, eventually leading to the splitting of the Israelites between the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. 　Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. 　The Bible says Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem, dedicating the temple to Yahweh, or God in Judaism. 　Solomon is portrayed as wealthy, wise and powerful, and as one of the 48 Jewish prophets. 　He is also the subject of many later references and legends, most notably in the Testament of Solomon (part of first-century biblical apocrypha). 　In the New Testament, he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by Jesus of Nazareth, and as arrayed in glory but excelled by "the lilies of the field". 　In the Quran, he is considered to be a major Islamic prophet and is generally referred to as Sulaiman ibn Dawud (Arabic: سُلَيْمَان بْن دَاوُوْد, lit. 'Solomon, son of David'). 　In mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.

<font size=3>
A ritual is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or objects, performed according to a set sequence. 　Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. 　Rituals are characterized, but not defined, by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. 　Rituals are a feature of all known human societies. 　They include not only the worship rites and sacraments of organized religions and cults, but also rites of passage, atonement and purification rites, oaths of allegiance, dedication ceremonies, coronations and presidential inaugurations, marriages, funerals and more. 　Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying "hello" may be termed as rituals. 　The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. 　One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or "etic" category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. 　The term can be used also by the insider or "emic" performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker. 　In psychology, the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.

<font size=3>
Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ KERR-ə-lə; Malayalam: [ke:ɾɐɭɐm] (listen)) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. 　It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Thiruvithamkoor. 　Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. 　It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. 　With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. 　It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. 　Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state. 　The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. 　The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). 　The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. 　The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. 　In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. 　At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Thiruvithamkoor and Cochin. 　They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. 　The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. 　After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara, and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks). 　Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. 　Kerala is the second-least impoverished state in India according to the Annual Report of Reserve Bank of India published in 2013. 　Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. 　The state topped in the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in 2019. 　The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly Malayalam and sometimes English. 　Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. 　The economy of Kerala is the 8th-largest in India with ₹8.55 trillion (US$110 billion) in gross state domestic product (GSDP) and a per capita net state domestic product of ₹222,000 (US$2,800). 　The tertiary sector contributes around 65% to state's GSVA, while the primary sector contributes only 8%. 　The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. 　The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. 　In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. 　The state is situated between Arabian Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain ranges to the east. 　The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370 mi), and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. 　Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with coconut-lined sandy beaches, backwaters, hill stations, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions.

<font size=3>
An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and/or freight. 　Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight. 　Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. 　Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators. 　The first airline was the German airship company DELAG, founded on November 16, 1909. 　The four oldest non-airship airlines that still exist are the Netherlands' KLM (1919), Colombia's Avianca (1919), Australia's Qantas (1920) and the Czech Republic's Czech Airlines (1923). 　Airline ownership has seen a shift from mostly personal ownership until the 1930s to government-ownership of major airlines from the 1940s to 1980s and back to large-scale privatization following the mid-1980s. 　Since the 1980s, there has also been a trend of major airline mergers and the formation of airline alliances. 　The largest alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam and Oneworld, and these three collectively account for more than 60% of global commercial air traffic in 2015. 　Airline alliances coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and frequent-flyer programs), offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). 　As of 2019[update], the largest airline by passengers carried and fleet size was the American Airlines Group, while Delta Air Lines was the largest by revenue. 　Lufthansa Group was the largest by number of employees, FedEx Express by freight ton-kilometers, Turkish Airlines by number of countries served and UPS Airlines by number of destinations served (though United Airlines was the largest passenger airline by number of destinations served).

A profession is a field of work that has been successfully professionalized. 　It can be defined as a disciplined group of individuals, professionals, who adhere to ethical standards and who hold themselves out as, and are accepted by the public as possessing special knowledge and skills in a widely recognised body of learning derived from research, education and training at a high level, and who are prepared to apply this knowledge and exercise these skills in the interest of others. 　Professional occupations are founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain. 　Medieval and early modern tradition recognized only three professions: divinity, medicine, and law, which were called the learned professions. 　A profession is not a trade and not an industry. 　Some professions change slightly in status and power, but their prestige generally remains stable over time, even if the profession begins to have more required study and formal education. 　Disciplines formalized more recently, such as architecture, now have equally long periods of study associated with them. 　Although professions may enjoy relatively high status and public prestige, not all professionals earn high salaries, and even within specific professions there exist significant differences in salary. 　In law, for example, a corporate defense lawyer working on an hourly basis may earn several times what a prosecutor or public defender earns.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_(pharmacology)>Elimination (pharmacology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In pharmacology the elimination or excretion of a drug is understood to be any one of a number of processes by which a drug is eliminated (that is, cleared and excreted) from an organism either in an unaltered form (unbound molecules) or modified as a metabolite. 　The kidney is the main excretory organ although others exist such as the liver, the skin, the lungs or glandular structures, such as the salivary glands and the lacrimal glands. 　These organs or structures use specific routes to expel a drug from the body, these are termed elimination pathways: Urine Tears Perspiration Saliva Respiration Milk Faeces Bile Drugs are excreted from the kidney by glomerular filtration and by active tubular secretion following the same steps and mechanisms as the products of intermediate metabolism. 　Therefore, drugs that are filtered by the glomerulus are also subject to the process of passive tubular reabsorption. 　Glomerular filtration will only remove those drugs or metabolites that are not bound to proteins present in blood plasma (free fraction) and many other types of drugs (such as the organic acids) are actively secreted. 　In the proximal and distal convoluted tubules non-ionised acids and weak bases are reabsorbed both actively and passively. 　Weak acids are excreted when the tubular fluid becomes too alkaline and this reduces passive reabsorption. 　The opposite occurs with weak bases. 　Poisoning treatments use this effect to increase elimination, by alkalizing the urine causing forced diuresis which promotes excretion of a weak acid, rather than it getting reabsorbed. 　As the acid is ionised, it cannot pass through the plasma membrane back into the blood stream and instead gets excreted with the urine. 　Acidifying the urine has the same effect for weakly basic drugs. 　On other occasions drugs combine with bile juices and enter the intestines. 　In the intestines the drug will join with the unabsorbed fraction of the administered dose and be eliminated with the faeces or it may undergo a new process of absorption to eventually be eliminated by the kidney. 　The other elimination pathways are less important in the elimination of drugs, except in very specific cases, such as the respiratory tract for alcohol or anaesthetic gases. 　The case of mother's milk is of special importance. 　The liver and kidneys of newly born infants are relatively undeveloped and they are highly sensitive to a drug's toxic effects. 　For this reason it is important to know if a drug is likely to be eliminated from a woman's body if she is breast feeding in order to avoid this situation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting>Casting</a> 
<font size=3>
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. 　The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. 　Casting materials are usually metals or various time setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. 　Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. 　Heavy equipment like machine tool beds, ships' propellers, etc. can be cast easily in the required size, rather than fabricating by joining several small pieces. 　Casting is a 7,000-year-old process. 　The oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 BC.

<font size=3>
A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. 　It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 　A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted △ A B C {\displaystyle \triangle ABC} . 　In Euclidean geometry, any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space). 　In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. 　If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. 　This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction>Conviction</a> 
<font size=3>
In law, a conviction is the verdict reached by a court of law finding a defendant guilty of a crime. 　The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, "not guilty"). 　In Scotland, there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which is considered an acquittal. 　Sometimes, despite a defendant being found guilty, the court may order that the defendant not be convicted. 　This is known as a discharge and is used in countries such as England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 　The criminal justice system is not perfect and there are instances in which guilty defendants are acquitted and innocent people are convicted. 　Appeal mechanisms and post conviction relief procedures may help to address this issue to some extent. 　An error leading to the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice. 　After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment. 　In addition to the sentence, a conviction can also have other consequences, known as collateral consequences of criminal charges. 　These can include impacts on employment, housing, and other areas of an individual's life. 　A minor conviction is a warning conviction that does not affect the defendant but serves as a warning.　[citation needed] A person's history of convictions is known as their antecedents or "previous" in the United Kingdom and "priors" in the United States and Australia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto>Otto</a> 
<font size=3>
Otto is a masculine German given name and a surname. 　It originates as an Old High German short form (variants Audo, Odo, Udo) of Germanic names beginning in aud-, an element meaning "wealth, prosperity". 　The name is recorded from the 7th century (Odo, son of Uro, courtier of Sigebert III). 　It was the name of three 10th-century German kings, the first of whom was Otto I the Great, the first Holy Roman Emperor, founder of the Ottonian dynasty. 　The Gothic form of the prefix was auda- (as in e.g. Audaþius), the Anglo-Saxon form was ead- (as in e.g. Eadmund), and the Old Norse form was auð-. 　The given name Otis arose from an English surname, which was in turn derived from Ode, a variant form of Odo, Otto. 　Due to Otto von Bismarck, the given name Otto was strongly associated with the German Empire in the later 19th century. 　It was comparatively frequently given in the United States (presumably in German American families) during the 1880s to 1890s, remaining in the top 100 most popular masculine given names in the US throughout 1880–1898, but its popularity decreased significantly after 1900 with increasing anti-German sentiment leading up to World War I; it fell below rank 200 in 1919, below rank 500 in 1947, and below rank 1000 in 1975; it re-entered the top-1000 most popular given names in the US only in the 2010s, ranking 696th as of 2013.

<font size=3>
A sequel is a work of literature, film, theatre, television, music or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. 　In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work. 　In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. 　A sequel can lead to a series, in which key elements appear repeatedly. 　Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some media franchises have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as such or not.　[citation needed] Sequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings. 　Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels financially appealing. 　In film, sequels are very common. 　There are many name formats for sequels. 　Sometimes, they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added on the end. 　More commonly, they have numbers at the end or have added words on the end.　[citation needed] It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or have a subtitle. 　In the 1930s, many musical sequels had the year included in the title. 　Sometimes sequels are released with different titles in different countries, because of the perceived brand recognition. 　There are several ways that subsequent works can be related to the chronology of the original. 　Various neologisms have been coined to describe them.

<font size=3>
Treasure (from Latin: thesaurus from Greek language θησαυρός thēsauros, "treasure store") is a concentration of wealth — often originating from ancient history — that is considered lost and/or forgotten until rediscovered. 　Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure, such as in the British Treasure Act 1996. 　The phrase "blood and treasure" has been used to refer to the human and monetary costs associated with massive endeavours such as war that expend both. 　Searching for hidden treasure is a common theme in legend; treasure hunters do exist, and can seek lost wealth for a living.
