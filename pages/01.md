<font size=3>
A road is a linear way for the conveyance of traffic that mostly has an improved surface for use by vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) and pedestrians. 　Unlike streets, the main function of roads is transportation. 　There are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and local roads. 　The primary features of roads include lanes, sidewalks (pavement), roadways (carriageways), medians, shoulders, verges, bike paths (cycle paths), and shared-use paths.

<font size=3>
January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is also the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day. 　It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer). 　In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa. 　Ancient Roman observances during this month include Cervula and Juvenalia, celebrated January 1, as well as one of three Agonalia, celebrated January 9, and Carmentalia, celebrated January 11. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song>Song</a> 

<font size=3>
A song is a musical composition intended to be performed by the human voice. 　This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches (melodies) using patterns of sound and silence. 　Songs contain various forms, such as those including the repetition and variation of sections. 　Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. 　If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. 　Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. 　Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs. 　Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. 　These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists. 　Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. 　Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). 　Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas, films, and TV shows. 　A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony, although the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and recitative instead. 　A song can be sung without accompaniment by instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. 　In popular music, a singer may perform with an acoustic guitarist, pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. 　In jazz, a singer may perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a trio or quartet), or with a big band. 　A Classical singer may perform with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. 　In jazz and blues, singers often learn songs "by ear" and they may improvise some melody lines. 　In Classical music, melodies are written by composers in sheet music format, so singers learn to read music. 　Songs with more than one voice to a part singing in polyphony or harmony are considered choral works. 　Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms and types, depending on the criteria used. 　Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word "song" may refer to instrumentals, such as the 20th century Songs Without Words pieces for solo piano.

June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the second of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the third of five months to have a length of less than 31 days. 　June contains the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours, and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). 　June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. 　In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June (meteorological summer begins on 1 June). 　In the Southern Hemisphere, meteorological winter begins on 1 June. 　At the start of June, the sun rises in the constellation of Taurus; at the end of June, the sun rises in the constellation of Gemini. 　However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, June begins with the sun in the astrological sign of Gemini, and ends with the sun in the astrological sign of Cancer.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
A country is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, or other political entity. 　It may be a sovereign state or make up one part of a larger state. 　For example, the country of Japan is an independent, sovereign state, while the country of Wales is a component of a multi-part sovereign state, the United Kingdom. 　A country may be a historically sovereign area (such as Korea), a currently sovereign territory with a unified government (such as Senegal), or a non-sovereign geographic region associated with certain distinct political, ethnic, or cultural characteristics (such as the Basque Country). 　The definition and usage of the word "country" is flexible and has changed over time. 　The Economist wrote in 2010 that "any attempt to find a clear definition of a country soon runs into a thicket of exceptions and anomalies." 　Most sovereign states, but not all countries, are members of the United Nations. 　The largest country by area is Russia, while the smallest is the microstate Vatican City. 　The most populous is China, while the Pitcairn Islands are the least populous.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love>Love</a> 

<font size=3>
This article contains special characters. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols. 　Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. 　An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food. 　Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment. 　Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. 　It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. 　In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. 　Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species. 　Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine or unconditional love (Agape). 　Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. 　Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified "moments" currently lacking in the English language. 　Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades. 　The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. 　The triangular theory of love suggests "intimacy, passion and commitment" are core components of love. 　Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. 　This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top>Top</a> 

<font size=3>
A spinning top, or simply a top, is a toy with a squat body and a sharp point at the bottom, designed to be spun on its vertical axis, balancing on the tip due to the gyroscopic effect. 　Once set in motion, a top will usually wobble for a few seconds, spin upright for a while, then start to wobble again with increasing amplitude as it loses energy, and finally tip over and roll on its side. 　Tops exist in many variations and materials, chiefly wood, metal, and plastic, often with a metal tip. 　They may be set in motion by twirling a handle with the fingers, by pulling a rope coiled around the body, or by means of a built-in auger (spiral plunger). 　Such toys have been used since antiquity in solitary or competitive games, where each player tries to keep one's top spinning for as long as possible, or achieve some other goal. 　Some tops have faceted bodies with symbols or inscriptions, and are used like dice to inject randomness into games, or for divination and ritual purposes. 　The ubiquity of spinning tops lends to the fact that the toy is used to name many living things such as Cyclosa turbinata, whose name comes from the Latin roots for spinning top.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army>Army</a> 

<font size=3>
An army, ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. 　In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or country. 　It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. 　Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. 　In some countries, such as France and China, the term "army", especially in its plural form "armies", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. 　To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. 　The naval force, although not using the term "army", is also included in the broad sense of the term "armies" — thus the French Navy is an integral component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the Ministry of the Armies. 　A similar pattern is seen in China, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military, the land force being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA Navy, and other branches. 　By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia. 　Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. 　Regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel. 　Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act), from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. 　Armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).

August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　Its zodiac sign is Leo and was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the 6th month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, with March being the first month of the year. 　About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. 　Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. 　In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of Emperor Augustus. 　According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt. 　Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. 　Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. 　In the Northern Hemisphere, August falls in the season of summer. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, the month falls during the season of winter. 　In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. 　Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome. 　Certain meteor showers take place in August. 　The Kappa Cygnids take place in August, with the dates varying each year. 　The Alpha Capricornids meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the Southern Delta Aquariids take place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28–29. 　The Perseids, a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. 　The star cluster of Messier 30 is best observed around August. 　Among the aborigines of the Canary Islands, especially among the Guanches of Tenerife, the month of August received in the name of Beñesmer or Beñesmen, which was also the harvest festival held this month.

<font size=3>
July is the seventh month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., it being the month of his birth. 　Before then it was called Quintilis, being the fifth month of the calendar that started with March. 　It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of winter. 　The second half of the year commences in July. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere. 　"Dog days" are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere, when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts. 　Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.

November is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars, the fourth and last of four months to have a length of 30 days and the fifth and last of five months to have a length of fewer than 31 days. 　November was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC. 　November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. 　November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. 　Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. 　In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 　November was referred to as Blōtmōnaþ by the Anglo-Saxons. 　Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican calendar.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door>Door</a> 

<font size=3>
A door is a hinged or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress (entry) into and egress (exit) from an enclosure. 　The created opening in the wall is a doorway or portal. 　A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide security by controlling access to the doorway (portal). 　Conventionally, it is a panel that fits into the doorway of a building, room, or vehicle. 　Doors are generally made of a material suited to the door's task. 　They are commonly attached by hinges, but can move by other means, such as slides or counterbalancing. 　The door may be able to move in various ways (at angles away from the doorway/portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. 　In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. 　But in other cases (e.g., a vehicle door) the two sides are radically different. 　Many doors incorporate locking mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them (such as with a key). 　Doors may have devices such as knockers or doorbells by which people outside announce their presence. 　(In some countries, such as Brazil, it is customary to clap from the sidewalk to announce one's presence.) 　Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors may have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing light to pass into and out of a space, of controlling ventilation or air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening noise, and of blocking the spread of fire. 　Doors can have aesthetic, symbolic, ritualistic purposes. 　Receiving the key to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider. 　Doors and doorways frequently appear in literature and the arts with metaphorical or allegorical import as a portent of change.

<font size=3>
Research is "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge". 　It involves the collection, organization and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic, characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error. 　These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases. 　A research project may be an expansion on past work in the field. 　To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. 　The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. 　Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. 　There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. 　The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.

<font size=3>
December is the twelfth and final month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and is also the last of seven months to have a length of 31 days. 　December got its name from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus c. 　750 BC which began in March. 　The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. 　Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name. 　In Ancient Rome, as one of the four Agonalia, this day in honour of Sol Indiges was held on December 11, as was Septimontium. 　Dies natalis (birthday) was held at the temple of Tellus on December 13, Consualia was held on December 15, Saturnalia was held December 17–23, Opiconsivia was held on December 19, Divalia was held on December 21, Larentalia was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of Sol Invictus was held on December 25. 　These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 　The Anglo-Saxons referred to December–January as Ġēolamonaþ (modern English: "Yule month"). 　The French Republican Calendar contained December within the months of Frimaire and Nivôse.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village>Village</a> 

<font size=3>
A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns), with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. 　Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. 　Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. 　Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. 　In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture and also for some non-agricultural societies. 　In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church. 　In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them. 　The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. 　This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts and development of many trades. 　The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization. 　Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defiance and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. 　Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds. 　In toponomastic terminology, the names of individual villages are called Comonyms (from Ancient Greek κώμη / village and ὄνυμα / name, [cf. ὄνομα]).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space>Space</a> 

<font size=3>
Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. 　In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. 　The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. 　However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. 　Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen. 　Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. 　In Isaac Newton's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space. 　Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. 　In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision. 　Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. 　Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his Critique of Pure Reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition". 　In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat. 　According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. 　Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

<font size=3>
A mother is the female parent of a child. 　A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth, by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation in the case of gestational surrogacy. 　A biological mother is the female genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or egg donation. 　A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her, such as an obligation of monetary support. 　An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. 　A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. 　A stepmother is a woman who is married to a child's father and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. 　A father is the male counterpart of a mother. 　Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such appellations are less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents. 　The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as "matrescence". 　The adjective "maternal" refers to a mother and comparatively to "paternal" for a father. 　The verb "to mother" means to procreate or to sire a child, or to provide care for a child, from which also derives the noun "mothering". 　Related terms of endearment are mom (mama, mommy), mum (mummy), mumsy, mamacita (ma, mam) and mammy. 　A female role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a mother-figure.

<font size=3>
A saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. 　It is used to cut through material, very often wood, though sometimes metal or stone. 　The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less vigorously back or continuously forward. 　This force may be applied by hand, or powered by steam, water, electricity or other power source. 　An abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal or ceramic.

<font size=3>
Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform. 　At the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed. 　Any natural process that is not completely random, and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information. 　Whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals, poems, pictures, music or other sounds, and currents convey information in a more continuous form. 　Information is not knowledge itself, but the meaning that may be derived from a representation through interpretation. 　Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step. 　For example, in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given domain. 　In a digital signal, bits may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up. 　The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing. 　The concept of information is relevant in various contexts, including those of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy. 　The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message. 　Information may be structured as data. 　Redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression. 　The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis. 　For example, data may be collected from a single customer's order at a restaurant. 　The information available from many orders may be analyzed, and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish. 　Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. 　Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. 　That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message. 　Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). 　It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication. 　The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. 　Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. 　Information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. 　The bit is a typical unit of information. 　It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. 　Other units such as the nat may be used. 　For example, the information encoded in one "fair" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. 　A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).

<font size=3>
A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. 　Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. 　National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. 　State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. 　Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. 　Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. 　Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. 　Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. 　Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. 　The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. 　In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. 　Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). 　Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger. 　Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months. 　There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.

<font size=3>
In the mathematical field of topology, a development is a countable collection of open covers of a topological space that satisfies certain separation axioms. 　Let X {\displaystyle X} be a topological space. 　A development for X {\displaystyle X} is a countable collection F 1 , F 2 , … {\displaystyle F_{1},F_{2},\ldots } of open coverings of X {\displaystyle X} , such that for any closed subset C ⊂ X {\displaystyle C\subset X} and any point p {\displaystyle p} in the complement of C {\displaystyle C} , there exists a cover F j {\displaystyle F_{j}} such that no element of F j {\displaystyle F_{j}} which contains p {\displaystyle p} intersects C {\displaystyle C} . 　A space with a development is called developable. 　A development F 1 , F 2 , … {\displaystyle F_{1},F_{2},\ldots } such that F i + 1 ⊂ F i {\displaystyle F_{i+1}\subset F_{i}} for all i {\displaystyle i} is called a nested development. 　A theorem from Vickery states that every developable space in fact has a nested development. 　If F i + 1 {\displaystyle F_{i+1}} is a refinement of F i {\displaystyle F_{i}} , for all i {\displaystyle i} , then the development is called a refined development. 　Vickery's theorem implies that a topological space is a Moore space if and only if it is regular and developable.

<font size=3>
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment. 　It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. 　A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick. 　Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic. 　Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata). 　The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction. 　Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass. 　Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(ecology)>Community (ecology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In ecology, a community is a group or association of populations of two or more different species occupying the same geographical area at the same time, also known as a biocoenosis, biotic community, biological community, ecological community, or life assemblage. 　The term community has a variety of uses. 　In its simplest form it refers to groups of organisms in a specific place or time, for example, "the fish community of Lake Ontario before industrialization". 　Community ecology or synecology is the study of the interactions between species in communities on many spatial and temporal scales, including the distribution, structure, abundance, demography, and interactions between coexisting populations. 　The primary focus of community ecology is on the interactions between populations as determined by specific genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. 　Community ecology also takes into account abiotic factors that influence species distributions or interactions (e.g. annual temperature or soil pH). 　For example, the plant communities inhabiting deserts are very different from those found in tropical rainforests due to differences in annual precipitation. 　Humans can also affect community structure through habitat disturbance, such as the introduction of invasive species. 　On a deeper level the meaning and value of the community concept in ecology is up for debate. 　Communities have traditionally been understood on a fine scale in terms of local processes constructing (or destructing) an assemblage of species, such as the way climate change is likely to affect the make-up of grass communities. 　Recently this local community focus has been criticised. 　Robert Ricklefs has argued that it is more useful to think of communities on a regional scale, drawing on evolutionary taxonomy and biogeography, where some species or clades evolve and others go extinct.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community>Community</a> 

<font size=3>
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as place, norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. 　Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. 　Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. 　Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, "community" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. 　The English-language word "community" derives from the Old French comuneté (Modern French: communauté), which comes from the Latin communitas "community", "public spirit" (from Latin communis, "common"). 　Human communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

<font size=3>
An office is a space where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization. 　The word "office" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. 　When used as an adjective, the term "office" may refer to business-related tasks. 　In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair. 　An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. 　In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions. 　According to James Stephenson, "Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities." 　Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. 　The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery, which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. 　With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. 　As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities. 　The time-and-motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor (1856-1915) led to the "Modern Efficiency Desk" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers. 　However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, and gradually the cubicle system evolved. 　The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs. 　Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing, and computer work. 　There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities. 　In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms, lounges, and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing. 　Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches. 　There are many[quantify] different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important. 　While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security. 　The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers. 　These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas. 　The chief operating officer (COO) is responsible for handling administration and maintenance of an office building.

<font size=3>
In psychology, control is a person's ability or perception of their ability to affect themselves, others, their conditions, their environment or some other circumstance. 　Control over oneself or others can extend to the regulation of emotions, thoughts, actions, impulses, memory, attention or experiences. 　There are several types of control, including: Perceived control (a person's perception of their own control and abilities to achieve outcomes) Desired control (the amount of control one seeks within a relationship or other circumstance) Cognitive control (the ability to select one's thoughts and actions) Emotional control (the ability to regulate one's feelings or attitudes toward something) Motivational control (one's ability to act on prescribed behaviors) Inhibitory control (the ability to inhibit thoughts or actions in favor of others) Social control (selecting one's environment for personal benefit) Ego control (the attempt to regulate impulses or attention processes) Effortful control (the ability to regulate how much effort one invests into a goal)

<font size=3>
In monotheistic thought, God is usually viewed as the supreme being, creator, and principal object of faith. 　Views regarding God vary considerably. 　Many notable theologians and philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God. 　Atheism rejects the belief in any deity. 　Agnosticism is the belief that the existence of God is unknown or unknowable. 　Among theists, some view knowledge concerning God as something derived from faith and God is often conceived as the greatest conceivable existent. 　God is often believed to be the cause of all things and so is seen as the creator and sustainer and the ruler of the universe. 　God is often thought of as incorporeal and independent of the material creation while pantheism holds God is the universe itself. 　God is sometimes seen as the most benevolent, while deism holds that God is not involved in humanity apart from creation. 　Some traditions attach spiritual significance to the relationship with God and see God as the source of all moral obligation, with acts such as worship and prayer. 　God is sometimes described without reference to gender, while others use terminology that is gender-specific. 　God is referred to by different names depending on the language and cultural tradition with titles also used to refer to different attributes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy>Energy</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, energy (from Ancient Greek: ἐνέργεια, enérgeia, “activity”) is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. 　Energy is a conserved quantity—the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. 　The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). 　Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, and the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system. 　All living organisms constantly take in and release energy. 　Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. 　Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. 　The Earth's climate and ecosystems processes are driven by the energy the planet receives from the Sun (although a small amount is also contributed by geothermal energy).

A council is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make decisions. 　A council may function as a legislature, especially at a town, city or county/shire level, but most legislative bodies at the state/provincial or national level are not considered councils. 　At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the entire government. 　A board of directors might also be denoted as a council. 　A committee might also be denoted as a council, though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. 　Because many schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants. 　A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor or councilperson, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman and councilwoman.

<font size=3>
Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. 　It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. 　It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. 　Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. 　Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. 　The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. 　It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.　: 60–61  In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. 　The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. 　Red became a symbolic color of communism and socialism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. 　Communist China adopted the red flag following the Chinese Revolution of 1949. 　It was adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975. 　Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. 　Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. 　In China, India, and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.　: 39–63

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land>Land</a> 

<font size=3>
Land, also known as dry land, ground, or earth, is the solid terrestrial surface of Earth not submerged by the ocean or another body of water. 　It makes up 29.2% of Earth's surface and includes all continents and islands. 　Earth's land surface is almost entirely covered by regolith, a layer of rock, soil, and minerals that forms the outer part of the crust. 　Land plays important roles in Earth's climate system and is involved in the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and water cycle. 　One third of land is covered in trees, another third is used for agriculture, and 10% is covered in permanent snow and glaciers. 　Land terrain varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, glaciers, and other landforms. 　In physical geology, the land is divided into two major categories: Mountain ranges and relatively flat interiors called cratons. 　Both are formed over millions of years through plate tectonics. 　Streams – a major part of Earth's water cycle – shape the landscape, carve rocks, transport sediments, and replenish groundwater. 　At high elevations or latitudes, snow is compacted and recrystallized over hundreds or thousands of years to form glaciers, which can be so heavy that they warp the Earth's crust. 　About 30 percent of land has a dry climate, due to losing more water through evaporation than it gains from precipitation. 　Since warm air rises, this generates winds, though Earth's rotation and uneven sun distribution also play a part. 　Land is commonly defined as the solid, dry surface of Earth. 　The word land may also collectively refer to land cover, rivers, shallow lakes, natural resources, non-marine fauna and flora (biosphere), the lower portions of the atmosphere (troposphere), groundwater reserves, and the physical results of human activity on land, such as architecture and agriculture. 　Even though saturated land, or mud, is common away from the ocean, the shoreline is referred to as where dry land begins for anyone in a body of water. 　Though modern terrestrial plants and animals evolved from aquatic creatures, Earth's first cellular life likely originated on land. 　Survival on land depends on fresh water from rivers, streams, lakes, and glaciers, which constitute only three percent of the water on Earth. 　The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that are habitable and support agriculture and various natural resources. 　In recent decades, scientists and policymakers have emphasized the need to manage land and its biosphere more sustainably, notably by restoring degraded soil, preserving biodiversity, protecting endangered species, and addressing climate change.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(biology)>Division (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Division is a taxonomic rank in biological classification that is used differently in zoology and in botany. 　In botany and mycology, division refers to a rank equivalent to phylum. 　The use of either term is allowed under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and both are commonly used in scientific literature. 　The main Divisions of land plants, in the order in which they probably evolved, are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Anthocerotophyta (hornworts), Bryophyta (mosses), Filicophyta (ferns), Sphenophyta (horsetails), Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (ginkgo)s, Pinophyta (conifers), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms, flowering plants). 　The flowering plants now dominate terrestrial ecosystems, comprising 80% of vascular plant species. 　In zoology, the term division is applied to an optional rank subordinate to the infraclass and superordinate to the cohort. 　A widely used classification (e.g. Carroll 1988) recognises teleost fishes as a Division Teleostei within Class Actinopterygii (the ray-finned fishes). 　Less commonly (as in Milner 1988), living tetrapods are ranked as Divisions Amphibia and Amniota within the clade of vertebrates with fleshy limbs (Sarcopterygii).

<font size=3>
Business is the practice of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). 　It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit." 　Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. 　If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. 　A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. 　The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business. 　The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company, such as a corporation or cooperative. 　Corporations, in contrast with sole proprietors and partnerships, are a separate legal entity and provide limited liability for their owners/members, as well as being subject to corporate tax rates. 　A corporation is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owners/members.

<font size=3>
In geography, regions, otherwise referred to as zones, lands or territories, are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). 　Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. 　Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. 　The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. 　As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. 　For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. 　The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. 　Regions are an area or division, especially part of a country or the world having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries. 　In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. 　Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force>Force</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, a force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. 　A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (e.g. moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. 　Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. 　A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. 　It is measured in the SI unit of newton (N). 　Force is represented by the symbol F (formerly P). 　The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. 　If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object. 　Concepts related to force include: thrust, which increases the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. 　In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. 　Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another. 　Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. 　Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human>Human</a> 

<font size=3>
Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate. 　They are a type of great ape that is characterized by bipedalism and exceptional cognitive skills due to a large and complex brain. 　Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. 　As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. 　The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study. 　Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. 　Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. 　For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. 　Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. 　The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. 　As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. 　Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022[update]. 　Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. 　Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. 　Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. 　At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. 　Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50. 　Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. 　Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. 　Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. 　Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. 　Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth. 　Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. 　They are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. 　The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. 　This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. 　Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. 　Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman>Woman</a> 

<font size=3>
A woman is an adult female human. 　Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). 　The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as "women's rights" to denote female humans regardless of age. 　Typically, women inherit a pair of X chromosomes, one from each parent, and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. 　More generally, sex differentiation of the female fetus is governed by the lack of a present, or functioning, SRY-gene on either one of the respective sex chromosomes. 　Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. 　A fully developed woman generally has a wider pelvis, broader hips, and larger breasts than an adult man. 　Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men. 　Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities, resulting in gender inequality; many religious doctrines and legal systems stipulate certain rules for women. 　With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education. 　Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. 　Some women are denied reproductive rights. 　The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality. 　Trans women have a gender identity that does not align with their male sex assignment at birth, while intersex women may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award>Award</a> 

<font size=3>
An award, sometimes called a distinction, is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field. 　When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration. 　An award may be described by three aspects: 　1) who is given 　2) what 　3) by whom, all varying according to purpose. 　The recipient is often to a single person, such as a student or athlete, or a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country. 　The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal, badge, or rosette (award). 　It can also be a token object such as certificate, diploma, championship belt, trophy, or plaque. 　The award may also be or be accompanied by a title of honor, as well as an object of direct value such as prize money or a scholarship. 　Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient(s) a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way. 　An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority (see fount of honour), or else a private organisation or individual. 　The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards. 　For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements. 　An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize. 　Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests. 　The Stanley Cup is a modern example. 　In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces. 　An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient. 　Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory. 　There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools. 　A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost>Almost</a> 

<font size=3>
In set theory, when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term almost or nearly is used to refer to all but a negligible amount of elements in the set. 　The notion of "negligible" depends on the context, and may mean "of measure zero" (in a measure space), "finite" (when infinite sets are involved), or "countable" (when uncountably infinite sets are involved). 　For example: The set S = { n ∈ N | n ≥ k } {\displaystyle S=\{n\in \mathbb {N} \,|\,n\geq k\}} is almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } for any k {\displaystyle k} in N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because only finitely many natural numbers are less than k {\displaystyle k} . 　The set of prime numbers is not almost N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , because there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not prime numbers. 　The set of transcendental numbers are almost R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , because the algebraic real numbers form a countable subset of the set of real numbers (which is uncountable). 　The Cantor set is uncountably infinite, but has Lebesgue measure zero. 　So almost all real numbers in (0, 1) are members of the complement of the Cantor set.

<font size=3>
Paper is a thin sheet material produced by mechanically or chemically processing cellulose fibres derived from wood, rags, grasses or other vegetable sources in water, draining the water through fine mesh leaving the fibre evenly distributed on the surface, followed by pressing and drying. 　Although paper was originally made in single sheets by hand, almost all is now made on large machines—some making reels 10 metres wide, running at 2,000 metres per minute and up to 600,000 tonnes a year. 　It is a versatile material with many uses, including printing, painting, graphics, signage, design, packaging, decorating, writing, and cleaning. 　It may also be used as filter paper, wallpaper, book endpaper, conservation paper, laminated worktops, toilet tissue, or currency and security paper, or in a number of industrial and construction processes. 　The papermaking process developed in east Asia, probably China, at least as early as 105 CE, by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun, although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BCE in China. 　The modern pulp and paper industry is global, with China leading its production and the United States following.

<font size=3>
In archaeology, a tell or tel (borrowed into English from Arabic: تَلّ, tall, 'mound' or 'small hill'), is an artificial topographical feature, a species of mound consisting of the accumulated and stratified debris of a succession of consecutive settlements at the same site, the refuse of generations of people who built and inhabited them, and of natural sediment. 　Tells are most commonly associated with the ancient Near East, but they are also found elsewhere, such as Southern and parts of Central Europe, from Greece and Bulgaria to Hungary and Spain and in North Africa. 　Within the Near East, they are concentrated in less arid regions, including Upper Mesopotamia, the Southern Levant, Anatolia and Iran, which had more continuous settlement. 　Eurasian tells date to the Neolithic,[dubious – discuss] the Neolithic/Chalcolithic, and the Bronze Age/Iron Age era. 　In the Southern Levant the time of the tells ended with the conquest by Alexander the Great, which ushered in the Hellenistic period with its own, different settlement-building patterns.　[citation needed] Many tells across the Near East continue to be occupied and used today.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_(mythology)>German (mythology)</a> 

<font size=3>
German (GER-man, pronounced [ˈɡerman]) is a South Slavic mythological being, recorded in the folklore of eastern Serbia and northern Bulgaria. 　He is a male spirit associated with bringing rain and hail. 　His influence on these precipitations can be positive, resulting in the amount of rain beneficial for agriculture, or negative, with a drought, downpours, or hail. 　Rituals connected with German included making a doll intended to represent this personage. 　This effigy of German, made of rags, fired clay, or dried fruits, was rather large, usually with a distinct representation of the male genitals. 　It was produced and used in rituals exclusively by girls or young women. 　In Eastern Serbia, when a drought developed, girls would make such a doll, and bring it to a river bank. 　Depending on the regional custom, they would either bury it by the river, or put it in a little coffin and let it float down the river. 　Two of the girls would then start lamenting for the doll. 　Asked by the others why they were crying, they would answer, "We are crying for German; because of the drought German has died so that the rain may fall." 　If the amount of rain falling should then become excessive, the doll would be dug up again. 　In northern Bulgaria, the rituals with German usually followed immediately after the Dodola rituals, but could be performed independently from them. 　In some villages they were carried out on the Feast of Saint Germanus. 　Girls would make the doll, 20 to 50 cm long, and lay it on a slate or in a little coffin. 　Having adorned it with flowers, they would bury it with funeral observances. 　After three, nine, or forty days, the doll was dug up and thrown into water. 　People would also try to ward off destructive summer hailstorms by placating German with a ritual performed on Christmas Eve. 　This ritual was recorded in the area around Pirot at the beginning of the 20th century. 　Immediately before the start of the Christmas Eve dinner, the head of the household would go out to his woodpile, to invite German to dinner. 　He would take with him a loaf of bread called "good luck", prepared particularly for this ritual, slivovitz, wine, and a wax candle. 　At the woodpile, he would shout three times, "German, German, wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not let me see your eyes anywhere!" 　He would then light the candle, take a sip of slivovitz, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. 　Asked how he had fared in his encounter with German, he would answer, "He came, so we dined and drank amply of slivovitz and wine, and then we parted." 　German, who dies so that the nature may regenerate with the falling of rain, can be understood as a spirit of vegetation, dying and then resurrecting with the revival of vegetation. 　His distinctly represented male genitals symbolize fertility. 　The doll of German is presumably a metaphorical replacement of the former human sacrifice. 　It can be included among the Slavic sacrificial dolls, together with the dolls of Yarilo, Kostroma, and Morena. 　In Christianized folk beliefs German is identified with Saint Germanus. 　This saint is associated with the protection from hail, and occasionally from lightning, though the latter was generally ascribed to Saint Elijah.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military>Military</a> 

<font size=3>
A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. 　It is typically authorized and maintained by a sovereign state, with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform. 　It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force, marines, or coast guard. 　The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats. 　In broad usage, the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. 　There are various forms of irregular military forces, not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces, they are less often referred to as simply military. 　A nation's military may function as a discrete social subculture, with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal services, food production, finance, and banking services. 　Beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, population control, the promotion of a political agenda, emergency services and reconstruction, protecting corporate economic interests, social ceremonies and national honour guards. 　The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself. 　Some of the most enduring images of classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders. 　The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramses II's reign, and his monuments commemorate it in bas-relief. 　A thousand years later, the first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he had himself buried with an army of terracotta soldiers. 　The Romans paid considerable attention to military matters, leaving to posterity many treatises and writings on the subject, as well as many lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns.

<font size=3>
Nothing, the complete absence of anything, has been a matter of philosophical debate since at least the 5th century BC. 　Early Greek philosophers argued that it was impossible for nothing to exist. 　The atomists allowed nothing but only in the spaces between the invisibly small atoms. 　For them, all space was filled with atoms. 　Aristotle took the view that there exists matter and there exists space, a receptacle into which matter objects can be placed. 　This became the paradigm for classical scientists of the modern age like Newton. 　Nevertheless, some philosophers, like Descartes, continued to argue against the existence of empty space until the scientific discovery of a physical vacuum. 　Existentialists like Sartre and Heidegger (as interpreted by Sartre) have associated nothing with consciousness. 　Some writers have made connections between Heidegger's concept of nothing and the nirvana of Eastern religions. 　Modern science does not equate vacuum with nothing. 　Indeed, the vacuum in quantum field theory is filled with virtual particles. 　The quantum vacuum is often viewed as a modern version of an aether theory.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London>London</a> 

<font size=3>
London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million. 　It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. 　The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries. 　The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. 　Since the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London, which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority. 　As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and communications. 　Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the largest urban economy in Europe, and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. 　With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions, it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. 　London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world. 　The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world. 　London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. 　The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9 million made it Europe's third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom and over 16% of the population of England. 　The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census. 　The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016, granting London the status of a megacity. 　London has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. 　Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. 　London has many museums, galleries, libraries and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres. 　Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final (held annually at Wembley Stadium), Wimbledon Tennis Championships and the London Marathon. 　In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.

<font size=3>
A role (also rôle or social role) is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. 　It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position. 　It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society. 　Social role theory posits the following about social behavior: The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles. 　Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society. 　Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors. 　When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms. 　Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change. 　The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements. 　The notion of the role can be and is examined in the social sciences, specifically economics, sociology and organizational theory.

<font size=3>
In phytosociology and community ecology an association is a type of ecological community with a predictable species composition and consistent physiognomy (structural appearance) which occurs in a particular habitat type.　: 181  The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt: 16  and formalised by the International Botanical Congress in 1910.: 182  An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum. 　The former view was championed by American ecologist Frederic Clements, who viewed the association as a whole that was more than the sum of its parts, and by Josias Braun-Blanquet, a Swiss-born phytosociologist. 　On the other end of the argument was American ecologist Henry Gleason,: 182–183  who saw these groupings of plant species as a coincidence produced by the "fluctuation and fortuitous immigration of plants, and an equally fluctuating and variable environment".

Association in psychology refers to a mental connection between concepts, events, or mental states that usually stems from specific experiences. 　Associations are seen throughout several schools of thought in psychology including behaviorism, associationism, psychoanalysis, social psychology, and structuralism. 　The idea stems from Plato and Aristotle, especially with regard to the succession of memories, and it was carried on by philosophers such as John Locke, David Hume, David Hartley, and James Mill. 　It finds its place in modern psychology in such areas as memory, learning, and the study of neural pathways.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education>Education</a> 

<font size=3>
Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. 　These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. 　Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. 　Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. 　In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. 　Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. 　Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills. 　Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. 　Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. 　In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. 　Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. 　It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. 　Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. 　In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings. 　For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure. 　Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. 　The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. 　Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas. 　There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. 　A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. 　For example, 24 January is the International Day of Education. 　At UN - level, several observance years and decades have been dedicated to education, such as 1970 International Education Year. 　Education is also one of the 17 Global Goals, where global initiatives aim at achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.

<font size=3>
A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. 　Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. 　In the social sciences, a larger society often exhibits stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups. 　Societies construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts as acceptable or unacceptable. 　These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. 　Societies, and their norms, undergo gradual and perpetual changes. 　So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. 　A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. 　This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology, and also applied to distinctive subsections of a larger society. 　More broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. 　In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than "other people" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.

<font size=3>
Language is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar and vocabulary. 　It is the primary means by which humans convey meaning, both in spoken and written forms, and may also be conveyed through sign languages. 　The vast majority of human languages have developed writing systems that allow for the recording and preservation of the sounds or signs of language. 　Human language is characterized by its cultural and historical diversity, with significant variations observed between cultures and across time. 　Human languages possess the properties of productivity and displacement, which enable the creation of an infinite number of sentences, and the ability to refer to objects, events, and ideas that are not immediately present in the discourse. 　The use of human language relies on social convention and is acquired through learning. 　Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. 　Precise estimates depend on an arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) established between languages and dialects. 　Natural languages are spoken, signed, or both; however, any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, writing, whistling, signing, or braille. 　In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures. 　Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. 　All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. 　Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances. 　The scientific study of language is called linguistics. 　Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, how words represent experience, etc., have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization. 　Thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) have argued that language originated from emotions, while others like Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) have argued that languages originated from rational and logical thought. 　Twentieth century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. 　Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. 　Language is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality. 　This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. 　Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. 　Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. 　Language and culture are codependent. 　Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment. 　Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. 　A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. 　There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. 　Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.

<font size=3>
In biology, a type is a particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached. 　In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralizes the defining features of that particular taxon. 　In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen. 　A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a species description) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election>Election</a> 

<font size=3>
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office. 　Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. 　Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. 　This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations. 　The global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot. 　Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. 　Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results). 　Election is the fact of electing, or being elected. 　To elect means "to select or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire>Fire</a> 

<font size=3>
Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. 　At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. 　The flame is the visible portion of the fire. 　Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. 　If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. 　Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different. 　Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. 　Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. 　The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. 　Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. 　If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. 　Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. 　This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is "fixed" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are "nitrogen-fixing" such as clover, peas, and green beans. 　Fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.

A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process. 　The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. 　In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. 　The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints; may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations; and is expected to interact with a certain environment. 　Typical examples of designs include architectural and engineering drawings, circuit diagrams, sewing patterns and less tangible artefacts such as business process models.

<font size=3>
A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. 　Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people (rather than goods). 　Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 　Cars became widely available during the 20th century. 　One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. 　Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. 　In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. 　The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy. 　Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. 　Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. 　These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. 　Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. 　Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. 　The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change. 　There are costs and benefits to car use. 　The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. 　The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. 　Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. 　Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. 　Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. 　People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. 　There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. 　Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.

<font size=3>
The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health, and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. 　Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence. 　The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. 　Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 　Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes. 　Law enforcement is only part of policing activity. 　Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. 　In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. 　Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies. 　Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality, and the enforcement of authoritarian rule. 　A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard. 　Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards. 　Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members. 　The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries. 　Numerous slang terms exist for the police. 　Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies. 　One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory>Theory</a> 

<font size=3>
A theory is a rational type of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking. 　The process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as observational study or research. 　Theories may be scientific, belong to a non-scientific discipline, or no discipline at all. 　Depending on the context, a theory's assertions might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works. 　The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings. 　In modern science, the term "theory" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. 　Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction ("falsify") of it. 　Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis). 　Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions. 　Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.　: 131  A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. 　To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.　: 46  The word theory or "in theory" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before. 　In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis. 　Instead of using the word "hypothetically", it is replaced by a phrase: "in theory". 　In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it "just a theory" (implying that the idea has not even been tested). 　Hence, that word "theory" is very often contrasted to "practice" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing, which is opposed to theory. 　A "classical example" of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. 　These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television>Television</a> 

<font size=3>
Television, sometimes shortened to TV, is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. 　The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission. 　Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports. 　Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. 　After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. 　During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. 　In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries. 　The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. 　For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). 　At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. 　Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. 　HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. 　Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu. 　In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. 　The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. 　Most television sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. 　Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. 　In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs. 　Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s. 　Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. 　Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. 　Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. 　Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. 　A standard television set consists of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. 　A visual display device that lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall>Hall</a> 

<font size=3>
In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls. 　In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept. 　Later in the Middle Ages, the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept. 　As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there. 　It was usually immediately inside the main door. 　In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor. 　Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly. 　Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard), or hallway.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio>Radio</a> 

<font size=3>
Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves. 　Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). 　They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by another antenna connected to a radio receiver. 　Radio is widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications. 　In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking, and satellite communication, among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. 　In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location. 　In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, a mobile receiver accepts radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. 　In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers, and keyless entry systems, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device. 　Applications of radio waves that do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens, and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines, are not usually called radio. 　The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver. 　The existence of radio waves was first proven by German physicist Heinrich Hertz on November 11, 1886. 　In the mid 1890s, building on techniques physicists were using to study electromagnetic waves, Guglielmo Marconi developed the first apparatus for long-distance radio communication, sending a wireless Morse Code message to a source over a kilometer away in 1895, and the first transatlantic signal on December 12, 1901. 　The first commercial radio broadcast was transmitted on November 2, 1920 when the live returns of the Harding-Cox presidential election were broadcast by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, under the call sign KDKA. 　The emission of radio waves is regulated by law, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the radio spectrum for different uses.

<font size=3>
The heart is a muscular organ in most animals. 　This organ pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. 　The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. 　In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. 　In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. 　Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. 　Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while most reptiles have three chambers. 　In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. 　The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. 　The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. 　The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. 　These generate a current that causes the heart to contract, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. 　In humans, deoxygenated blood enters the heart through the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes it to the right ventricle. 　From here it is pumped into pulmonary circulation to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. 　Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta into systemic circulation, traveling through arteries, arterioles, and capillaries—where nutrients and other substances are exchanged between blood vessels and cells, losing oxygen and gaining carbon dioxide—before being returned to the heart through venules and veins. 　The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. 　Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers it in the long term, and is good for heart health. 　Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. 　Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. 　Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. 　Cardiovascular diseases do not frequently have symptoms but may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. 　Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound. 　Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment. 　A teenager's heartbeat Sounds of a healthy 16-year-old child's heart beating normally, as heard with a stethoscope. 　Problems playing this file? 　See media help.

England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. 　It shares land borders with Wales to its west and Scotland to its north. 　The Irish Sea lies northwest and the Celtic Sea area of the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. 　It is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. 　The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight. 　The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic period, but takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. 　England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century. 　The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law—the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. 　The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation. 　England's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. 　However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the Lake District and Pennines) and in the west (for example, Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills). 　The capital is London, which has the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. 　England's population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century. 　The Kingdom of England – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. 　In 1801, Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland (through another Act of Union) to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 　In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind>Mind</a> 

<font size=3>
The mind is the set of faculties responsible for all mental phenomena. 　Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves. 　These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will, and sensation. 　They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention, and emotion. 　Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed. 　Important distinctions group them according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious, or occurrent. 　Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals. 　Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed. 　Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states. 　Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind. 　According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental. 　For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play. 　Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition. 　Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality. 　The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem. 　Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical. 　Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity[need quotation to verify] though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. 　Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds.　[citation needed] For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines.　[citation needed] Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions. 　Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. 　Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers. 　Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. 　The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind. 　The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.

<font size=3>
Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82. 　It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. 　Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point. 　When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. 　It tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. 　Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements. 　Lead is toxic, even in small amounts, especially to children. 　Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal. 　Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. 　Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. 　Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. 　Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains and polyhedral structures. 　Since lead is easily extracted from its ores, prehistoric people in the Near East were aware of it. 　Galena is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver. 　Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome. 　Lead production declined after the fall of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. 　Lead played a crucial role in the development of the printing press, as movable type could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys. 　In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. 　Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. 　These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding. 　Lead's toxicity became widely recognized in the late 19th century, although a number of well-educated ancient Greek and Roman writers were aware of this fact and even knew some of the symptoms of lead poisoning. 　Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones; it damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of biological enzymes, causing neurological disorders ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep>Keep</a> 

<font size=3>
A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. 　Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. 　The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England, south Italy and Sicily. 　As a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, use spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. 　The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. 　Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade or more to build. 　During the 12th century, new designs began to be introduced – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. 　By the end of the century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. 　In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall fighting towers called bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. 　In the second half of the 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. 　In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. 　Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period. 　In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery. 　For example, in 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, the keep of Bamburgh Castle on the Northumberland coast, previously considered to be impregnable, was defeated with bombards. 　By the 16th century, keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences. 　Many were destroyed in civil wars between the 17th and 18th centuries or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies. 　During the 19th century, keeps became fashionable once again and in England and France, a number were restored or redesigned by Gothic architects. 　Despite further damage to many French and Spanish keeps during the wars of the 20th century, keeps now form an important part of the tourist and heritage industry in Europe.

Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". 　A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. 　Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. 　Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. 　Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.

<font size=3>
Health is an attribute in a video game or tabletop game that determines the maximum amount of damage or loss of stamina that a character or object can take before dying or losing consciousness. 　In role-playing games, this typically takes the form of hit points (HP), a numerical attribute representing the health of a character or object. 　The game character can be a player character, a boss, or a mob. 　Health can also be attributed to destructible elements of the game environment or inanimate objects such as vehicles and their individual parts. 　In video games, health is often represented by visual elements such as a numerical fraction, a health bar or a series of small icons, though it may also be represented acoustically, such as through a character's heartbeat.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person>Person</a> 

<font size=3>
A person (PL: people) is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. 　The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts. 　In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. 　The plural form "people" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in "a people"), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. 　The plural form "persons" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.

<font size=3>
A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. 　The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. 　Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. 　The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. 　Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. 　The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars. 　Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye, all within the Milky Way galaxy. 　A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. 　Its total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and eventual fate. 　A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. 　This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. 　At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a black hole. 　Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. 　Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. 　These elements are then recycled into new stars. 　Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time. 　Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. 　When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. 　Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science>Science</a> 

<font size=3>
Science is a systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. 　Systematic reasoning is tens of thousands of years old. 　The earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to modern science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. 　Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.　: 12  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance. 　The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. 　The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape, along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science". 　Modern science is typically divided into three major branches: natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules. 　There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines, because they do not rely on empirical evidence. 　Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medicine. 　New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. 　Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. 　The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the ethical and moral development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact>Fact</a> 

<font size=3>
A fact is a datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance, which, if accepted as true and proven true, allows a logical conclusion to be reached on a true–false evaluation. 　Standard reference works are often used to check facts. 　Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means. 　For example, "This sentence contains words." accurately describes a linguistic fact, and "The sun is a star" accurately describes an astronomical fact. 　Further, "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States" and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" both accurately describe historical facts. 　Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion. 　Facts are different from theories, values, and objects.
