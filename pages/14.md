## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_(archaeology)>Blade (archaeology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In archaeology, a blade is a type of stone tool created by striking a long narrow flake from a stone core. 　This process of reducing the stone and producing the blades is called lithic reduction. 　Archaeologists use this process of flintknapping to analyze blades and observe their technological uses for historical purposes. 　Blades are defined as being flakes that are at least twice as long as they are wide and that have parallel or subparallel sides and at least two ridges on the dorsal (outer) side. 　Blade cores appear and are different from regular flaking cores, as each core's conchoidal nature is suited for different types of flaking. 　Blades are created using stones that have a cryptocrystalline structure and easily be fractured into a smooth piece without fracturing. 　Blades became the favored technology of the Upper Palaeolithic era, although they are occasionally found in earlier periods. 　Different techniques are also required for blade creation; a soft punch or hammerstone is necessary for creating a blade. 　The long sharp edges of blades made them useful for a variety of purposes. 　After blades are flaked, they are often incorporated as parts of larger tools, such as spears. 　Other times, the simple shape and sharpness serves the designed role. 　Blades were often employed in the impression process of material culture, assisting ancient humans in imprinting ornate designs into other parts of their material culture. 　Scrapers, used for hide working or woodworking, or burins, used for engraving, are two common such examples. 　Cores from which blades have been struck are called blade cores and the tools created from single blades are called blade tools. 　Small examples (under 12 mm) are called microblades and were used in the Mesolithic as elements of composite tools. 　Blades with one edge blunted by removal of tiny flakes are called backed blade. 　A blade core becomes an exhausted core when there are no more useful angles to knock off blades. 　Blades can be classified into many different types depending on their shape and size. 　Archaeologists have also been known to use the microscopic striations created from the lithic reduction process to classify the blades into specific types. 　Once classified archaeologists can use this information to see how the blade was produced, who produced it, and how it was used.

<font size=3>
Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. 　It borders Greater London to the northwest, Surrey to the west and East Sussex to the southwest, and Essex to the north across the estuary of the River Thames; it faces the French department of Pas-de-Calais across the Strait of Dover. 　The county town is Maidstone. 　It is the fifth most populous county in England, the most populous non-metropolitan county and the most populous of the home counties. 　Kent was one of the first British territories to be settled by Germanic tribes, most notably the Jutes, following the withdrawal of the Romans. 　Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, the oldest cathedral in England, has been the seat of the Archbishops of Canterbury since the conversion of England to Christianity that began in the 6th century with Saint Augustine. 　Rochester Cathedral in Medway is England's second-oldest cathedral. 　Located between London and the Strait of Dover, which separates England from mainland Europe, Kent has been the setting for both conflict and diplomacy, including the Battle of Britain in World War II and the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004. 　England relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 10th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance. 　France can be seen clearly in fine weather from Folkestone and the White Cliffs of Dover. 　Hills in the form of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge span the length of the county and in the Vale of Holmesdale in between and to the south are most of the county's 26 castles. 　Kent's economy is diversified: agriculture, haulage, logistics and tourism are various industries. 　Because of its orchards and allotments, Kent is known as "The Garden of England". 　In northwest Kent, industries include extraction of aggregate building materials, printing and scientific research. 　Coal mining has also played its part in Kent's industrial heritage. 　Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt and its strong transport connections to the capital and the nearby continent make Kent a high-income county. 　Twenty-eight per cent of the county forms part of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the North Downs and The High Weald.

In medicine, confusion is the quality or state of being bewildered or unclear. 　The term "acute mental confusion" is often used interchangeably with delirium in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and the Medical Subject Headings publications to describe the pathology. 　These refer to the loss of orientation, or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. 　Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered consciousness (the loss of linear thinking) and memory loss (the inability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material).

<font size=3>
Arkansas (/ˈɑːrkənsɔː/ (listen) AR-kən-saw) is a landlocked state in the South Central United States. 　It is bordered by Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east, Louisiana to the south, and Texas and Oklahoma to the west. 　Its name is from the Osage language, a Dhegiha Siouan language, and referred to their relatives, the Quapaw people. 　The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. 　Arkansas is the 29th largest by area and the 34th most populous state, with a population of just over 3 million at the 2020 census. 　The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, in the central part of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. 　The northwestern corner of the state, including the Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area and Fort Smith metropolitan area, is a population, education, and economic center. 　The largest city in the state's eastern part is Jonesboro. 　The largest city in the state's southeastern part is Pine Bluff. 　Previously part of French Louisiana and the Louisiana Purchase, the Territory of Arkansas was admitted to the Union as the 25th state on June 15, 1836. 　Much of the Delta had been developed for cotton plantations, and landowners there largely depended on enslaved African Americans' labor. 　In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. 　On returning to the Union in 1868, Arkansas continued to suffer economically, due to its overreliance on the large-scale plantation economy. 　Cotton remained the leading commodity crop, and the cotton market declined. 　Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in economic opportunity. 　In the late 19th century, the state instituted various Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and segregate the African-American population. 　During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Arkansas and particularly Little Rock were major battlegrounds for efforts to integrate schools. 　White interests dominated Arkansas's politics, with disfranchisement of African Americans and refusal to reapportion the legislature. 　Only after the civil rights movement and federal legislation passed were more African Americans able to vote. 　The Supreme Court overturned rural domination in the South and other states that had refused to reapportion their state legislatures or retained rules based on geographic districts. 　In a series of cases in the 1960s during the height of related civil rights activities, the Warren Court invoked a one person, one vote principle, applying the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution and holding that states had to organize their legislatures by districts that held approximately equal populations, and that these had to be redefined as necessary after each decade's census. 　Following World War II in the 1940s, Arkansas began to diversify its economy and see prosperity. 　During the 1960s, the state became the base of the Walmart corporation, the world's largest company by revenue, headquartered in Bentonville. 　In the 21st century, Arkansas's economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, soybeans and rice. 　Arkansas's culture is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. 　Notable people from the state include politician and educational advocate William Fulbright; former president Bill Clinton, who also served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas; general Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander; Walmart founder and magnate Sam Walton; singer-songwriters Johnny Cash, Charlie Rich, Jimmy Driftwood, and Glen Campbell; actor-filmmaker Billy Bob Thornton; poet C. D. Wright; physicist William L. McMillan, a pioneer in superconductor research; poet laureate Maya Angelou; Douglas MacArthur; musician Al Green; actor Alan Ladd; basketball player Scottie Pippen; singer Ne-Yo; Chelsea Clinton; actress Sheryl Underwood; and author John Grisham.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast>Oblast</a> 

<font size=3>
An oblast (/ˈɒblæst/; also UK: /ˈɒblɑːst/; Cyrillic (in most languages, including Russian and Ukrainian): область, Bulgarian: област) is a type of administrative division within some Slavic areas, the Russian Empire, and the Soviet Union; it continues to be used in Russia and some post-Imperial/Soviet states. 　The term oblast has no universal definition or exact comparison in English, although it has been presented as analogous to the term "county" in the U.S. Official terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ, but some still use a cognate of the Russian term, e.g., vobłasć (voblasts, voblasts', official orthography: вобласць, Taraškievica: вобласьць, [ˈvobɫasʲtsʲ]) is used for regions of Belarus, oblys (plural: oblystar) for regions of Kazakhstan, and oblusu (облусу) for regions of Kyrgyzstan. 　The term is often translated as "area", "zone", "province" or "region". 　The last translation may lead to confusion, because "raion" may be used for other kinds of administrative division, which may be translated as "region", "district" or "county" depending on the context. 　Unlike "province", translations as "area", "zone", and "region" may lead to confusion because they have very common meanings other than a political division.

Civilians under international humanitarian law are "persons who are not members of the armed forces" and they are not "combatants if they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war". 　It is slightly different from a non-combatant, because some non-combatants are not civilians (for example, military chaplains who are attached to the belligerent party or military personnel who are serving with a neutral country). 　Civilians in the territories of a party to an armed conflict are entitled to certain privileges under the customary laws of war and international treaties such as the Fourth Geneva Convention. 　The privileges that they enjoy under international law depends on whether the conflict is an internal one (a civil war) or an international one. 　In some nations, uniformed members of civilian police or fire departments colloquially refer to members of the public as civilians.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)>Hybrid (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In biology, a hybrid is the offspring resulting from combining the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. 　Generally, it means that each cell has genetic material from two different organisms, whereas an individual where some cells are derived from a different organism is called a chimera. 　Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigor, sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent. 　The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. 　In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. 　In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are. 　Species are reproductively isolated by strong barriers to hybridisation, which include genetic and morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. 　Some act before fertilization and others after it. 　Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes. 　A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled. 　Human impact on the environment has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species, and the proliferation of introduced species worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridisation. 　This genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion from monoculture in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. 　A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridisation is the crossing of wild and domesticated species. 　This is common in both traditional horticulture and modern agriculture; many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs, and trees have been produced by hybridisation. 　One such flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy. 　It is also more occasionally done in the livestock and pet trades; some well-known wild × domestic hybrids are beefalo and wolfdogs. 　Human selective breeding of domesticated animals and plants has resulted in the development of distinct breeds (usually called cultivars in reference to plants); crossbreeds between them (without any wild stock) are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as "hybrids". 　Hybrid humans existed in prehistory. 　For example, Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40,000 years ago. 　Mythological hybrids appear in human culture in forms as diverse as the Minotaur, blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as centaurs and sphinxes, and the Nephilim of the Biblical apocrypha described as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.

Devoted is the sequel to New York Times-bestselling novel Elixir by American entertainer Hilary Duff with Elise Allen. 　It was published and released to booksellers on October 11, 2011. 　It is the second in an unnamed trilogy by Duff and Allen. 　After the release of Elixir in 2010, Duff stated that she intended to write more in the series. 　She said, however, that nothing had been put down as yet and that she and her co-writer, Allen, were simply playing around with different ideas. 　On October 18, 2010, Duff posted on Twitter about a sequel: "Can't believe so many people have read the book already! Yipeeee! Starting the next one in two weeks". 　Devoted was released on October 11, 2011. 　In an interview with MTV, Duff stated that "Devoted picks up basically where Elixir left off, and Clea has a lot of big questions to answer and decisions to make."[failed verification] She also said that plans for the third and final book in the trilogy were being discussed and that "I don't think it will be as long. It will be a wrap-up, kind of where they are now and what exactly happened to the Elixir, whose hands it's in, what ends up happening with Sage."

<font size=3>
Estimation (or estimating) is the process of finding an estimate or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. 　The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available. 　Typically, estimation involves "using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter". 　The sample provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing information. 　An estimate that turns out to be incorrect will be an overestimate if the estimate exceeds the actual result and an underestimate if the estimate falls short of the actual result.

Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. 　The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water. 　Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds. 　The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. 　The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa. 　Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds. 　The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable, and durable textile. 　The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley civilization, as well as fabric remnants dated back to 4200 BC in Peru. 　Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today. 　Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. 　India is the world's largest producer of cotton. 　The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.

Arabic (اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ, al-ʿarabiyyah [al ʕaraˈbijːa] (listen); عَرَبِيّ, ʿarabī [ˈʕarabiː] (listen) or [ʕaraˈbij]) is a Semitic language spoken primarily across the Arab world. 　Having emerged in the 1st century, it is named after the Arab people; the term "Arab" was initially used to describe those living in the Arabian Peninsula, as perceived by geographers from ancient Greece. 　Since the 7th century, Arabic has been characterized by diglossia, with an opposition between a standard prestige language—i.e., Literary Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Classical Arabic—and diverse vernacular varieties, which serve as mother tongues. 　Colloquial dialects vary significantly from MSA, impeding mutual intelligibility. 　MSA is only acquired through formal education and is not spoken natively. 　It is the language of literature, official documents, and formal written media. 　In spoken form, MSA is used in formal contexts, news bulletins and for prayers. 　This variety is the lingua franca of the Arab world and the liturgical language of Islam. 　It is an official language of 26 states and 1 disputed territory, the third most after English and French. 　It is also one of six official languages of the United Nations. 　Spoken varieties are the usual medium of communication in all other domains. 　They are not standardized and vary significantly, some of them being mutually unintelligible. 　The International Organization for Standardization assigns language codes to 33 varieties of Arabic, including MSA. 　Arabic vernaculars do not descend from MSA or Classical Arabic. 　Combined, Arabic dialects have 362 million native speakers, while MSA is spoken by 274 million L2 speakers, making it the sixth most spoken language in the world. 　Arabic is traditionally written with the Arabic alphabet, a right-to-left abjad. 　This alphabet is the official script for MSA. 　Colloquial varieties were traditionally not written, however, with the emergence of social media, the amount of written dialects has significantly increased online. 　Besides the Arabic alphabet, dialects are also often written in Latin from left to right or in Hebrew characters (in Israel) with no standardized orthography. 　Maltese and Hassaniya are the only varieties officially written in a Latin alphabet.

<font size=3>
Logic is the study of correct reasoning. 　It includes both formal and informal logic. 　Formal logic is the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. 　It is a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral way. 　When used as a countable noun, the term "a logic" refers to a logical formal system that articulates a proof system. 　Formal logic contrasts with informal logic, which is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory. 　While there is no general agreement on how formal and informal logic are to be distinguished, one prominent approach associates their difference with whether the studied arguments are expressed in formal or informal languages. 　Logic plays a central role in multiple fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. 　Logic studies arguments, which consist of a set of premises together with a conclusion. 　Premises and conclusions are usually understood either as sentences or as propositions and are characterized by their internal structure; complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked to each other by propositional connectives like ∧ {\displaystyle \land } (and) or → {\displaystyle \to } (if...then). 　The truth of a proposition usually depends on the denotations of its constituents. 　Logically true propositions constitute a special case since their truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in them and not on the denotations of other terms. 　Arguments can be either correct or incorrect. 　An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. 　The strongest form of support is found in deductive arguments: it is impossible for their premises to be true and their conclusion to be false. 　Deductive arguments contrast with ampliative arguments, which may arrive in their conclusion at new information that is not present in the premises. 　However, it is possible for all their premises to be true while their conclusion is still false. 　Many arguments found in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments, sometimes divided into inductive and abductive arguments. 　Inductive arguments usually take the form of statistical generalizations while abductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation. 　Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning are called fallacies. 　Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments. 　Logic has been studied since Antiquity; early approaches include Aristotelian logic, Stoic logic, Anviksiki, and the Mohists. 　Modern formal logic has its roots in the work of late 19th-century mathematicians such as Gottlob Frege. 　While Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms, in the modern era its traditional dominance was replaced by classical logic, a set of fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians. 　It consists of propositional logic, which only considers the logical relations on the level of propositions, and first-order logic, which also articulates the internal structure of propositions using various linguistic devices, such as predicates and quantifiers. 　Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and extend it to other fields, such as metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology. 　Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative accounts of the fundamental laws of logic.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege>Siege</a> 

<font size=3>
A siege is a military blockade of a city, or fortress, with the intent of conquering by attrition, or a well-prepared assault. 　This derives from Latin: sedere, lit. 　'to sit'. 　Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static, defensive position. 　Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is common, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. 　The art of conducting and resisting sieges is called siege warfare, siegecraft, or poliorcetics. 　A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that cannot be easily taken by a quick assault, and which refuses to surrender. 　Sieges involve surrounding the target to block the provision of supplies and the reinforcement or escape of troops (a tactic known as "investment"). 　This is typically coupled with attempts to reduce the fortifications by means of siege engines, artillery bombardment, mining (also known as sapping), or the use of deception or treachery to bypass defenses. 　Failing a military outcome, sieges can often be decided by starvation, thirst, or disease, which can afflict either the attacker or defender. 　This form of siege, though, can take many months or even years, depending upon the size of the stores of food the fortified position holds. 　The attacking force can circumvallate the besieged place, which is to build a line of earth-works, consisting of a rampart and trench, surrounding it. 　During the process of circumvallation, the attacking force can be set upon by another force, an ally of the besieged place, due to the lengthy amount of time required to force it to capitulate. 　A defensive ring of forts outside the ring of circumvallated forts, called contravallation, is also sometimes used to defend the attackers from outside. 　Ancient cities in the Middle East show archaeological evidence of fortified city walls. 　During the Warring States era of ancient China, there is both textual and archaeological evidence of prolonged sieges and siege machinery used against the defenders of city walls. 　Siege machinery was also a tradition of the ancient Greco-Roman world. 　During the Renaissance and the early modern period, siege warfare dominated the conduct of war in Europe. 　Leonardo da Vinci gained as much of his renown from the design of fortifications as from his artwork. 　Medieval campaigns were generally designed around a succession of sieges. 　In the Napoleonic era, increasing use of ever more powerful cannons reduced the value of fortifications. 　In the 20th century, the significance of the classical siege declined. 　With the advent of mobile warfare, a single fortified stronghold is no longer as decisive as it once was. 　While traditional sieges do still occur, they are not as common as they once were due to changes in modes of battle, principally the ease by which huge volumes of destructive power can be directed onto a static target. 　Modern sieges are more commonly the result of smaller hostage, militant, or extreme resisting arrest situations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright>Wright</a> 

<font size=3>
Wright is an occupational surname originating in England. 　The term 'Wright' comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word 'wryhta' or 'wyrhta', meaning worker or shaper of wood. 　Later it became any occupational worker (for example, a shipwright is a person who builds ships), and is used as a British family name. 　The word's use as an occupational title continued until the mid-19th century, often combined with other words such as in shipwright, wheelwright, wainwright and playwright. 　As of 2014[update], Wright was the eleventh most common surname in England. 　The word carpentier, now "carpenter", was introduced into England in the years after the Norman conquest in 1066 and slowly replaced the traditional name and meaning of wright in most of England. 　'Wright' is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of 'skilled woodworker'. 　The Incorporation of Wrights of the Trades House of Glasgow, and the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons of Edinburgh Trades retain the word in its original meaning in their role of promoting the woodworking trade. 　Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name "MacIntyre" or "Mac an t-Saoir", meaning "son of the wright" (son of the carpenter). 　In Ireland, the native Gaelic Mac an Cheairt sept of County Mayo occasionally changed their name to Wright. 　This is a literal translation meaning, "son of the right or righteous".

<font size=3>
Regulation is the management of complex systems according to a set of rules and trends. 　In systems theory, these types of rules exist in various fields of biology and society, but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. 　For example: in biology, gene regulation and metabolic regulation allow living organisms to adapt to their environment and maintain homeostasis; in government, typically regulation means stipulations of the delegated legislation which is drafted by subject-matter experts[citation needed] to enforce primary legislation; in business, industry self-regulation occurs through self-regulatory organizations and trade associations which allow industries to set and enforce rules with less government involvement; and, in psychology, self-regulation theory is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals.

Coordinates: 24°N 90°E﻿ / ﻿24°N 90°E﻿ / 24; 90 This article contains Bengali text. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols. 　Bangladesh (/ˌbæŋɡləˈdɛʃ, ˌbɑːŋ-/; Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (listen)), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. 　It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 165 million people in an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). 　Bangladesh is among the most densely populated countries in the world, and shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. 　It is narrowly separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the north. 　Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial and cultural centre. 　Chittagong, the second-largest city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. 　The official language is Bengali, one of the easternmost branches of the Indo-European language family. 　Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of India in 1947. 　The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. 　Ancient Bengal was an important cultural centre in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. 　The Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal. 　The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in 1204 when Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and invaded Tibet. 　Becoming part of the Delhi Sultanate, three city-states emerged in the 14th century with much of eastern Bengal being ruled from Sonargaon. 　Sufi missionary leaders like Sultan Balkhi, Shah Jalal and Shah Makhdum Rupos helped in spreading Muslim rule. 　The region was unified into an independent, unitary Bengal Sultanate. 　Under Mughal rule, eastern Bengal continued to prosper as the melting pot of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent and attracted traders from around the world. 　The Bengali elite were among the richest people in the world due to strong trade networks like the muslin trade which supplied textiles, such as 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. 　Mughal Bengal became increasingly assertive and independent under the Nawabs of Bengal in the 18th century. 　In 1757, the betrayal of Mir Jafar resulted in the defeat of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah to the British East India Company and eventual British dominance across South Asia. 　The Bengal Presidency grew into the largest administrative unit in British India. 　The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. 　In 1940, the first Prime Minister of Bengal supported the Lahore Resolution with the hope of creating a state in the eastern subcontinent. 　Prior to the partition of Bengal, the Prime Minister of Bengal proposed a Bengali sovereign state. 　A referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line established the present-day territorial boundary of Bangladesh. 　In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan. 　It was renamed as East Pakistan with Dhaka becoming the country's legislative capital. 　The Bengali Language Movement in 1952; the East Bengali legislative election, 1954; the 1958 Pakistani coup d'état; the Six point movement of 1966; and the 1970 Pakistani general election resulted in the rise of Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements in East Pakistan. 　The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, in which the Mukti Bahini aided by India waged a successful armed revolution. 　The conflict saw the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, including intellectuals. 　The new state of Bangladesh became the first constitutionally secular state in South Asia in 1972. 　Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. 　In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed secular principles in the constitution. 　A middle power in the Indo-Pacific, Bangladesh is the second largest economy in South Asia. 　It maintains the third-largest military in the region and is a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. 　The large Muslim population of Bangladesh makes it the third-largest Muslim-majority country. 　Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic based on the Westminster system. 　Bengalis make up 99% of the total population of Bangladesh. 　The country consists of eight divisions, 64 districts and 495 subdistricts. 　It hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world due to the Rohingya genocide. 　Bangladesh faces many challenges, particularly corruption and effects of climate change. 　Bangladesh has been a leader within the Climate Vulnerable Forum. 　It hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC. 　It is a founding member of SAARC, as well as a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Commonwealth of Nations.

<font size=3>
A harbor (American English), harbour (British English; see spelling differences), or haven is a sheltered body of water where ships, boats, and barges can be docked. 　The term harbor is often used interchangeably with port, which is a man-made facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. 　Ports usually include one or more harbors. 　Alexandria Port in Egypt is an example of a port with two harbors. 　Harbors may be natural or artificial. 　An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed breakwaters, sea walls, or jettys or they can be constructed by dredging, which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging. 　An example of an artificial harbor is Long Beach Harbor, California, United States, which was an array of salt marshes and tidal flats too shallow for modern merchant ships before it was first dredged in the early 20th century. 　In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides of land. 　Examples of natural harbors include Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia and Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka.

<font size=3>
Funerary practices in different cultures A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial or cremation, with the attendant observances. 　Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honor. 　Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. 　Funerals have both normative and legal components. 　Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation. 　The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition. 　Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation or sky burial) or its preservation (for example, by mummification or interment). 　Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. 　A memorial service (or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person. 　The word funeral comes from the Latin funus, which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. 　Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil>Devil</a> 

<font size=3>
A devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions. 　It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force. 　Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 　1) a principle of evil independent from God, 　2) an aspect of God, 　3) a created being turning evil (a fallen angel), and 　4) a symbol of human evil.　: 23  Each tradition, culture, and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil. 　The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and literature developing independently within each of the traditions. 　It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names—Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, Iblis—and attributes: it is portrayed as blue, black, or red; it is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on. 　While depictions of the devil are usually taken seriously, there are times when it is treated less seriously; when, for example, devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers.

<font size=3>
Birmingham (/ˈbɜːrmɪŋəm/ (listen) BUR-ming-əm) is a city and metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of West Midlands in England. 　It is the second-largest city in the United Kingdom with a population of 1.145 million in the city proper, 2.92 million in the West Midlands metropolitan county, and approximately 4.3 million in the wider metropolitan area. 　It is the largest UK metropolitan area outside of London. 　Birmingham is known as the second city of the United Kingdom. 　Located in the West Midlands region of England, approximately 100 miles (160 km) from London, Birmingham is considered to be the social, cultural, financial and commercial centre of the Midlands. 　Distinctively, Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it, mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole – one of the closest main rivers is the Severn, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of the city centre. 　Historically a market town in Warwickshire in the medieval period, Birmingham grew during the 18th century during the Midlands Enlightenment and during the Industrial Revolution, which saw advances in science, technology and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society. 　By 1791, it was being hailed as "the first manufacturing town in the world". 　Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation; this provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. 　The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham. 　The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which, under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain, was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy. 　From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943, Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz. 　The damage done to the city's infrastructure, in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners, led to extensive urban regeneration in subsequent decades. 　Birmingham's economy is now dominated by the service sector. 　The city is a major international commercial centre and an important transport, retail, events and conference hub. 　Its metropolitan economy is the second-largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $121.1bn (2014[update]). 　Its five universities, including the University of Birmingham, make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London. 　Birmingham's major cultural institutions – the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Library of Birmingham and Barber Institute of Fine Arts – enjoy international reputations, and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art, music, literary and culinary scenes. 　The city also successfully hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games. 　In 2021, Birmingham was the third most visited city in the UK by people from foreign nations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon>Photon</a> 

<font size=3>
A photon (from Ancient Greek φῶς, φωτός (phôs, phōtós) 'light') is an elementary particle that is a quantum of the electromagnetic field, including electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio waves, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. 　Photons are massless, so they always move at the speed of light in vacuum, 299792458 m/s (or about 186,282 mi/s). 　The photon belongs to the class of bosons. 　As with other elementary particles, photons are best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality, their behavior featuring properties of both waves and particles. 　The modern photon concept originated during the first two decades of the 20th century with the work of Albert Einstein, who built upon the research of Max Planck. 　While trying to explain how matter and electromagnetic radiation could be in thermal equilibrium with one another, Planck proposed that the energy stored within a material object should be regarded as composed of an integer number of discrete, equal-sized parts. 　To explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein introduced the idea that light itself is made of discrete units of energy. 　In 1926, Gilbert N. Lewis popularized the term photon for these energy units. 　Subsequently, many other experiments validated Einstein's approach. 　In the Standard Model of particle physics, photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime. 　The intrinsic properties of particles, such as charge, mass, and spin, are determined by gauge symmetry. 　The photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including lasers, Bose–Einstein condensation, quantum field theory, and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. 　It has been applied to photochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and measurements of molecular distances. 　Moreover, photons have been studied as elements of quantum computers, and for applications in optical imaging and optical communication such as quantum cryptography.

<font size=3>
Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the county seat of Allegheny County. 　It is the most populous city in both Allegheny County and Western Pennsylvania, the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, and the 68th largest city in the U.S. with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. 　The city anchors the Greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania; its population of 2.37 million is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 27th-largest in the U.S. 　It is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton combined statistical area that extends into Ohio and West Virginia. 　Pittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River. 　Pittsburgh is known both as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry, and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges. 　The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclined railways, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. 　The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders. 　Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in the manufacturing of other important materials—aluminum and glass—and in the petroleum industry. 　Additionally, it is a leader in computing, electronics, and the automotive industry. 　For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. 　Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out. 　The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990. 　However, this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums, medical centers, parks, research centers, and a diverse cultural district. 　After 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the health care, education, and technology industries. 　Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. 　Google, Apple, Bosch, Meta, Nokia, Autodesk, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM are among some 1,600 technology firms with a presence in the city, generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh payrolls. 　Federal money has supported the research agenda. 　The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy. 　The nation's fifth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300 U.S. law firms make their global headquarters in the area, while RAND Corporation (RAND), BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have regional bases that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth. 　In 2015, Pittsburgh was listed among the "eleven most livable cities in the world" by Metropolis magazine. 　The Economist's Global Liveability Ranking placed Pittsburgh as the most or second-most livable city in the United States in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2018. 　The region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf>Leaf</a> 

<font size=3>
A leaf is a principal appendage of the stem of a vascular plant, usually borne laterally aboveground and specialized for photosynthesis. 　Leaves are collectively called foliage, as in "autumn foliage", while the leaves, stem, flower, and fruit collectively form the shoot system. 　In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue is the palisade mesophyll and is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf but in some species, including the mature foliage of Eucalyptus, palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral. 　Most leaves are flattened and have distinct upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces that differ in color, hairiness, the number of stomata (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of epicuticular wax and other features. 　Leaves are mostly green in color due to the presence of a compound called chlorophyll that is essential for photosynthesis as it absorbs light energy from the sun. 　A leaf with lighter-colored or white patches or edges is called a variegated leaf. 　Leaves can have many different shapes, sizes, textures and colors. 　The broad, flat leaves with complex venation of flowering plants are known as megaphylls and the species that bear them, the majority, as broad-leaved or megaphyllous plants, which also includes acrogymnosperms and ferns. 　In the lycopods, with different evolutionary origins, the leaves are simple (with only a single vein) and are known as microphylls. 　Some leaves, such as bulb scales, are not above ground. 　In many aquatic species, the leaves are submerged in water. 　Succulent plants often have thick juicy leaves, but some leaves are without major photosynthetic function and may be dead at maturity, as in some cataphylls and spines. 　Furthermore, several kinds of leaf-like structures found in vascular plants are not totally homologous with them. 　Examples include flattened plant stems called phylloclades and cladodes, and flattened leaf stems called phyllodes which differ from leaves both in their structure and origin. 　Some structures of non-vascular plants look and function much like leaves. 　Examples include the phyllids of mosses and liverworts.

Cargo consists of goods conveyed by water, air, or land. 　In economics, freight is cargo that is transported at a freight rate for commercial gain. 　Cargo was originally a shipload but now covers all types of freight, including transport by rail, van, truck, or intermodal container. 　The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facility. 　The term freight is commonly used to describe the movements of flows of goods being transported by any mode of transportation. 　Multi-modal container units, designed as reusable carriers to facilitate unit load handling of the goods contained, are also referred to as cargo, especially by shipping lines and logistics operators. 　Similarly, aircraft ULD boxes are also documented as cargo, with an associated packing list of the items contained within. 　When empty containers are shipped each unit is documented as a cargo and when goods are stored within, the contents are termed containerized cargo.

<font size=3>
An instrumental or instrumental song is music normally without any vocals, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a big band setting. 　Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word song may refer to instrumentals. 　The music is primarily or exclusively produced using musical instruments. 　An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer themselves will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in components from a duo or trio to a large big band, concert band or orchestra. 　In a song that is otherwise sung, a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an instrumental interlude, or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental introduction. 　If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a "solo" (e.g., the guitar solo that is a key section of heavy metal music and hard rock songs). 　If the instruments are percussion instruments, the interlude can be called a percussion interlude or "percussion break". 　These interludes are a form of break in the song.

Afghanistan, officially the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of Central Asia and South Asia. 　Referred to as the Heart of Asia, it is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, Tajikistan to the northeast, and China to the northeast and east. 　Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest, which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range. 　Kabul is the country's largest city and serves as its capital. 　As of 2021[update], Afghanistan's population is 40.2 million (officially estimated to be 32.9 million), composed of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Qizilbash, Aimak, Pashayi, Baloch, Pamiris, Nuristanis, and others. 　Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's strategic location along the historic Silk Road has led it to being described, picturesquely, as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’. 　Popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires, the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Maurya Empire, Arab Muslims, the Mongols, the British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by an American-led coalition. 　Afghanistan also served as the source from which the Greco-Bactrians and the Mughals, among others, rose to form major empires. 　The various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres made the area a center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and later Islam throughout history. 　The modern state of Afghanistan began with the Durrani dynasty in the 18th century, with the Durrani Afghan Empire being formed by Ahmad Shah Durrani. 　The Durrani Empire led conquests in which, at its peak, encompassed land that spanned from eastern Iran to northern India. 　It is however, argued that Dost Mohammad Khan laid the foundations of the first modern Afghan state. 　Following the Durrani Empire's decline and the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Timur Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not limited to: Herat, Kandahar and Kabul. 　Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after 70 years of civil war from 1793–1863, with wars of unification led by Dost Mohammad Khan from 1823-1863, where he conquered the independent principalities in Afghanistan under the Emirate of Kabul. 　Dost Mohammad died in 1863, days after his last campaign to unite Afghanistan, and as a result, threw Afghanistan back into civil war with his successors. 　During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire (in British-ruled India) and the Russian Empire. 　From India, the British attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War. 　However, the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British political influence over Afghanistan. 　Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign political hegemony, and emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan. 　This monarchy lasted almost 50 years, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established. 　Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history has been dominated by extensive warfare, including coups, invasions, insurgencies, and civil wars. 　The conflict began in 1978 when a communist revolution established a socialist state, and subsequent infighting prompted the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan in 1979. 　Mujahideen fought against them in the Soviet–Afghan War and continued fighting amongst themselves following Soviet withdrawal in 1989. 　The Islamic fundamentalist Taliban controlled most of the country by 1996, but their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan. 　The Taliban returned to power in 2021 following Kabul's capture by the Taliban and the concurrent overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, ending the 2001–2021 war. 　Although initially claiming to form an inclusive government for the country, the Taliban in September 2021 re-established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with an interim government made up entirely of Taliban members; the regime currently remains internationally unrecognized. 　Afghanistan is rich in natural resources, including lithium, iron, zinc, and copper. 　It is also the world's largest producer of opium, second largest producer of cannabis, and third largest of both saffron and cashmere. 　The country is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and a founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. 　Due to the effects of war in recent decades, the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism, poverty, and child malnutrition. 　Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th-largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity. 　Afghanistan is one of the least developed countries ranking 180th in the Human development Index, and fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018[update].

<font size=3>
Shadows was a series of horror anthologies edited by Charles L. Grant, published by Doubleday from 1978 to 1991. 　Grant, a proponent of "quiet horror", initiated the series in order to offer readers a showcase of this kind of fiction. 　The short stories appearing in the Shadows largely dispensed with traditional Gothic settings, and had very little physical violence. 　Instead, they featured slow accumulations of dread through subtle omens, mostly taking place in everyday settings. 　While Grant himself was very adept at this kind of fiction, he contributed no stories to the anthologies, writing only the introductions and author profiles. 　The first volume in the series won the World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology.

<font size=3>
The incumbent is the current holder of an office or position, usually in relation to an election. 　In an election for president, the incumbent is the person holding or acting in the office of president before the election, whether seeking re-election or not. 　In some situations, there may not be an incumbent at time of an election for that office or position (ex; when a new electoral division is created), in which case the office or position is regarded as vacant or open. 　In the United States, an election without an incumbent is referred to as an open seat or open contest.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre>Genre</a> 

<font size=3>
Genre (from French genre 'kind, or sort') is any form or type of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time. 　In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. 　Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. 　Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. 　Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. 　Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility. 　Genre began[clarification needed] as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature, as set out in Aristotle's Poetics. 　For Aristotle, poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre. 　Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, for example, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. 　Genres proliferate and develop beyond Aristotle’s classifications in response to changes in audiences and creators. 　Genre has become a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictability through artistic expression. 　Given that art is often a response to a social state, in that people write, paint, sing, dance, and otherwise produce art about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. 　Musician Ezra LaFleur argues that discussion of genre should draw from Ludwig Wittgenstein's idea of family resemblance. 　Genres are helpful labels for communicating but do not necessarily have a single attribute that is the essence of the genre.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn>Burn</a> 

<font size=3>
A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn). 　Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire. 　Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace. 　In the home, risks are associated with domestic kitchens, including stoves, flames, and hot liquids. 　In the workplace, risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns. 　Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. 　Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault). 　Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. 　They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. 　When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. 　Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. 　Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. 　In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. 　Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff. 　Healing typically does not occur on its own. 　A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. 　The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. 　Burns are generally preventable. 　Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. 　Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. 　Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. 　Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. 　It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. 　Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. 　Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. 　The most common complications of burns involve infection. 　Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date. 　In 2015, fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries. 　This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 176,000 deaths. 　Among women in much of the world, burns are most commonly related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. 　Among men, they are more likely a result of unsafe workplace conditions. 　Most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world, particularly in Southeast Asia. 　While large burns can be fatal, treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes, especially in children and young adults. 　In the United States, approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries. 　The long-term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario>Scenario</a> 

<font size=3>
In the performing arts, a scenario (/sɪˈnɑːri.oʊ/, US also /sɪˈnɛəri.oʊ, -ˈnær-/; Italian: [ʃeˈnaːrjo]; from Italian scenario 'that which is pinned to the scenery') is a synoptical collage of an event or series of actions and events. 　In the commedia dell'arte, it was an outline of entrances, exits, and action describing the plot of a play, and was literally pinned to the back of the scenery. 　It is also known as canovaccio or "that which is pinned to the canvas" of which the scenery was constructed. 　Surviving scenarios from the Renaissance contain little other than character names, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation. 　It is believed that a scenario formed the basis for a fully improvisational performance, though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate. 　Modern commedia troupes most often make use of a script with varying degrees of additional improvisation. 　In the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted and to summarize the aspects of character, staging, plot, etc. that can be expanded later in a fully developed libretto, or script. 　This sketch can be helpful in "pitching" the idea to a prospective producer, director or composer. 　In the filmmaking of the early 20th century, film scenarios (also called "treatments" or "synopses") were short written scripts to provide narrative coherence that had previously been improvised. 　They could consist of a simple list of scene headings or scene headings with a detailed explication of the action in each scene. 　At this time in the silent era, scripts had yet to include individual shots or dialogue. 　These scenario scripts evolved into lengthier continuity scripts, which listed a number of shots within each scene, thus providing continuity to streamline the filmmaking process.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy>Entropy</a> 

<font size=3>
Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. 　The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. 　It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication. 　The thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential. 　In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. 　He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. 　Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation. 　A consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. 　Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. 　Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. 　He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI). 　In 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. 　Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. 　This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism>Tourism</a> 

<font size=3>
Tourism is travel for pleasure or business, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel. 　The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". 　Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. 　Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. 　The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts. 　Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. 　International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012. 　Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade. 　Global tourism accounts for c. 　8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. 　Emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. 　For this reason, many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism to mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. 　The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017, and programs like Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy. 　Tourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism as well as the current industry with cruise ships, there are many different ways of tourism. 　Another potential new tourism industry is virtual tourism.

<font size=3>
Baron is a rank of nobility or title of honour, often hereditary, in various European countries, either current or historical. 　The female equivalent is baroness. 　Typically, the title denotes an aristocrat who ranks higher than a lord or knight, but lower than a viscount or count. 　Often, barons hold their fief – their lands and income – directly from the monarch. 　Barons are less often the vassals of other nobles. 　In many kingdoms, they were entitled to wear a smaller form of a crown called a coronet. 　The term originates from the Latin term barō, via Old French. 　The use of the title baron came to England via the Norman Conquest of 1066, then the Normans brought the title to Scotland and Italy. 　It later spread to Scandinavia and Slavic lands.

<font size=3>
Cattle (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, cloven-hooved, herbivores. 　They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. 　Adult females are referred to as cows and adult males are referred to as bulls. 　Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. 　They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). 　Another product of cattle is their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. 　In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious significance. 　Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are also kept as pets. 　Different types of cattle are common to different geographic areas. 　Taurine cattle are found primarily in Europe and temperate areas of Asia, the Americas, and Australia. 　Zebus (also called indicine cattle) are found primarily in India and tropical areas of Asia, America, and Australia. 　Sanga cattle are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. 　These types (which are sometimes classified as separate species or subspecies) are further divided into over 1,000 recognized breeds. 　Around 10,500 years ago, taurine cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 wild aurochs progenitors in central Anatolia, the Levant and Western Iran. 　A separate domestication event occurred in the Indian subcontinent, which gave rise to zebu. 　According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are approximately 1.5 billion cattle in the world as of 2018. 　Cattle are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and are responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 　In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome.

A fraction (from Latin: fractus, "broken") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. 　When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. 　A common, vulgar, or simple fraction (examples: 1 2 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}} and 17 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {17}{3}}} ) consists of a numerator, displayed above a line (or before a slash like 1⁄2), and a non-zero denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. 　Numerators and denominators are also used in fractions that are not common, including compound fractions, complex fractions, and mixed numerals. 　In positive common fractions, the numerator and denominator are natural numbers. 　The numerator represents a number of equal parts, and the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. 　The denominator cannot be zero, because zero parts can never make up a whole. 　For example, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator 3 indicates that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, and the denominator 4 indicates that 4 parts make up a whole. 　The picture to the right illustrates 3/4 of a cake. 　A common fraction is a numeral which represents a rational number. 　That same number can also be represented as a decimal, a percent, or with a negative exponent. 　For example, 0.01, 1%, and 10−2 are all equal to the fraction 1/100. 　An integer can be thought of as having an implicit denominator of one (for example, 7 equals 7/1). 　Other uses for fractions are to represent ratios and division. 　Thus the fraction 3/4 can also be used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole), and the division 3 ÷ 4 (three divided by four). 　The non-zero denominator rule, which applies when representing a division as a fraction, is an example of the rule that division by zero is undefined. 　We can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. 　For example, if 1/2 represents a half-dollar profit, then −1/2 represents a half-dollar loss. 　Because of the rules of division of signed numbers (which states in part that negative divided by positive is negative), −1/2, −1/2 and 1/−2 all represent the same fraction – negative one-half. 　And because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, −1/−2 represents positive one-half. 　In mathematics the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero, is called the set of rational numbers and is represented by the symbol Q, which stands for quotient. 　A number is a rational number precisely when it can be written in that form (i.e., as a common fraction). 　However, the word fraction can also be used to describe mathematical expressions that are not rational numbers. 　Examples of these usages include algebraic fractions (quotients of algebraic expressions), and expressions that contain irrational numbers, such as 2 2 {\textstyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}}} (see square root of 2) and π/4 (see proof that π is irrational).

<font size=3>
Gospel originally meant the Christian message ("the gospel"), but in the 2nd century it came to be used also for the books in which the message was set out. 　In this sense a gospel can be defined as a loose-knit, episodic narrative of the words and deeds of Jesus, culminating in his trial and death and concluding with various reports of his post-resurrection appearances. 　Modern scholars are cautious of relying on the gospels uncritically, but nevertheless, they provide a good idea of the public career of Jesus, and critical study can attempt to distinguish the original ideas of Jesus from those of the later authors. 　The four canonical gospels were probably written between AD 66 and 110. 　All four were anonymous (with the modern names added in the 2nd century), almost certainly none were by eyewitnesses, and all are the end-products of long oral and written transmission. 　Mark was the first to be written, using a variety of sources. 　The authors of Matthew and Luke both independently used Mark for their narrative of Jesus's career, supplementing it with a collection of sayings called the Q source and additional material unique to each. 　There is near-consensus that John had its origins as the hypothetical Signs Gospel thought to have been circulated within a Johannine community. 　The contradictions and discrepancies between the first three and John make it impossible to accept both traditions as equally reliable. 　Many non-canonical gospels were also written, all later than the four canonical gospels, and like them advocating the particular theological views of their various authors. 　Important examples include the gospels of Thomas, Peter, Judas, and Mary; infancy gospels such as that of James (the first to introduce the perpetual virginity of Mary); and gospel harmonies such as the Diatessaron.

<font size=3>
In Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), Gabriel (/ˈɡeɪbriəl/ GAY-bree-əl) is an archangel with power to announce God's will to men. 　He is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Quran. 　Many Christian traditions — including Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Roman Catholicism — revere Gabriel as a saint. 　In the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel appears to the prophet Daniel to explain his visions (Daniel 8:15–26, 9:21–27). 　The archangel also appears in the Book of Enoch and other ancient Jewish writings not preserved in Hebrew. 　Alongside the archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of Israel, defending its people against the angels of the other nations. 　In the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke relates the stories of the Annunciation, in which the angel Gabriel appears to Zechariah and the Virgin Mary, announcing to each the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively (Luke 1:11–38). 　Islam regards Gabriel as an archangel sent by God to various prophets, including Muhammad. 　The first five verses of the Al-Alaq, the 96th chapter of the Quran, is believed by Muslims to have been the first verses revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius>Radius</a> 

<font size=3>
In classical geometry, a radius (PL: radii) of a circle or sphere is any of the line segments from its center to its perimeter, and in more modern usage, it is also their length. 　The name comes from the latin radius, meaning ray but also the spoke of a chariot wheel. 　The plural of radius can be either radii (from the Latin plural) or the conventional English plural radiuses. 　The typical abbreviation and mathematical variable name for radius is R or r. 　By extension, the diameter D is defined as twice the radius: d ≐ 2 r ⇒ r = d 2 . 　{\displaystyle d\doteq 2r\quad \Rightarrow \quad r={\frac {d}{2}}.　} If an object does not have a center, the term may refer to its circumradius, the radius of its circumscribed circle or circumscribed sphere. 　In either case, the radius may be more than half the diameter, which is usually defined as the maximum distance between any two points of the figure. 　The inradius of a geometric figure is usually the radius of the largest circle or sphere contained in it. 　The inner radius of a ring, tube or other hollow object is the radius of its cavity. 　For regular polygons, the radius is the same as its circumradius. 　The inradius of a regular polygon is also called apothem. 　In graph theory, the radius of a graph is the minimum over all vertices u of the maximum distance from u to any other vertex of the graph. 　The radius of the circle with perimeter (circumference) C is r = C 2 π {\displaystyle r={\frac {C}{2\pi }}}

<font size=3>
In mathematics, the remainder is the amount "left over" after performing some computation. 　In arithmetic, the remainder is the integer "left over" after dividing one integer by another to produce an integer quotient (integer division). 　In algebra of polynomials, the remainder is the polynomial "left over" after dividing one polynomial by another. 　The modulo operation is the operation that produces such a remainder when given a dividend and divisor. 　Alternatively, a remainder is also what is left after subtracting one number from another, although this is more precisely called the difference. 　This usage can be found in some elementary textbooks; colloquially it is replaced by the expression "the rest" as in "Give me two dollars back and keep the rest." 　However, the term "remainder" is still used in this sense when a function is approximated by a series expansion, where the error expression ("the rest") is referred to as the remainder term.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare>Welfare</a> 

<font size=3>
Welfare, or commonly social welfare, is a type of government support intended to ensure that members of a society can meet basic human needs such as food and shelter. 　Social security may either be synonymous with welfare, or refer specifically to social insurance programs which provide support only to those who have previously contributed (e.g. most pension systems), as opposed to social assistance programs which provide support on the basis of need alone (e.g. most disability benefits). 　The International Labour Organization defines social security as covering support for those in old age, support for the maintenance of children, medical treatment, parental and sick leave, unemployment and disability benefits, and support for sufferers of occupational injury. 　More broadly, welfare may also encompass efforts to provide a basic level of well-being through free or subsidized social services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, vocational training, and public housing. 　In a welfare state, the state assumes responsibility for the health, education, infrastructure and welfare of society, providing a range of social services such as those described. 　Some historians view systems of codified almsgiving, like the zakat policy of the seventh century (634 CE) Rashidun caliph Umar, as early examples of universal government welfare. 　The first welfare state was Imperial Germany (1871–1918), where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889. 　In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913, and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946, during the Attlee government (1945–51). 　In the countries of western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues, and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations (NGOs), and charities (social and religious). 　A right to social security and an adequate standard of living is asserted in Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<font size=3>
In physics and the philosophy of science, instant refers to an infinitesimal interval in time, whose passage is instantaneous. 　In ordinary speech, an instant has been defined as "a point or very short space of time," a notion deriving from its etymological source, the Latin verb instare, from in- + stare ('to stand'), meaning 'to stand upon or near.' 　The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by Aristotle in his Physics, where he wrote on Zeno's paradoxes. 　The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later. 　As of October 2020[update], the smallest time interval certify in regulated measurements is on the order of 397 zeptoseconds (397 × 10−21 seconds).

A shower is a place in which a person bathes under a spray of typically warm or hot water. 　Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. 　Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle. 　The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. 　This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water onto different parts of their body. 　A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door. 　Showering is common due to the efficiency of using it compared with a bathtub. 　Its use in hygiene is, therefore, common practice.　[page needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark>Quark</a> 

<font size=3>
A quark (/kwɔːrk, kwɑːrk/) is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. 　Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. 　All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. 　Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas. 　For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons. 　Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin. 　They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge. 　There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. 　Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. 　The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. 　Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). 　For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have equal magnitude but opposite sign. 　The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. 　Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. 　Accelerator program experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. 　The top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered.

<font size=3>
In medicine, a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat) by trained fingertips. 　The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery). 　Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate. 　The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation, traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute. 　The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers. 　This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep). 　The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.

<font size=3>
In electrical engineering, a switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another. 　The most common type of switch is an electromechanical device consisting of one or more sets of movable electrical contacts connected to external circuits. 　When a pair of contacts is touching current can pass between them, while when the contacts are separated no current can flow. 　Switches are made in many different configurations; they may have multiple sets of contacts controlled by the same knob or actuator, and the contacts may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. 　A switch may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, or may function as a sensing element to sense the position of a machine part, liquid level, pressure, or temperature, such as a thermostat. 　Many specialized forms exist, such as the toggle switch, rotary switch, mercury switch, push-button switch, reversing switch, relay, and circuit breaker. 　A common use is control of lighting, where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures. 　Switches in high-powered circuits must have special construction to prevent destructive arcing when they are opened.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen>Oxygen</a> 

<font size=3>
Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. 　It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. 　Oxygen is Earth's most abundant element, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe. 　At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 2. 　Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. 　Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides. 　All plants, animals, and fungus need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy by the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. 　In vetabrate animals breathing brings oxygen into the lungs where gas exchange takes place, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood, and oxygen diffuses into the blood. 　The body's circulatory system transports the oxygen the cells, where cellular respiration takes place. 　Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. 　Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. 　Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. 　Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. 　Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O 3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. 　However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant. 　Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. 　Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. 　Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. 　The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion. 　Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.

<font size=3>
Dawn is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise. 　It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in Earth's atmosphere, when the centre of the Sun's disc has reached 18° below the observer's horizon. 　This morning twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), when direct sunlight outshines the diffused light.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster>Disaster</a> 

<font size=3>
A disaster is a serious problem occurring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. 　Disasters are routinely divided into either "natural disasters" caused by natural hazards or "human-instigated disasters" caused from anthropogenic hazards. 　However, in modern times, the divide between natural, human-made and human-accelerated disasters is difficult to draw. 　Examples of natural hazards include avalanches, flooding, cold waves and heat waves, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, lightning, tsunamis, volcanic activity, wildfires, and winter precipitation. 　Examples of anthropogenic hazards include criminality, civil disorder, terrorism, war, industrial hazards, engineering hazards, power outages, fire, hazards caused by transportation, and environmental hazards. 　Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95% of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of gross domestic product) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper>Copper</a> 

<font size=3>
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. 　It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. 　A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. 　Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement. 　Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals). 　This led to very early human use in several regions, from circa 8000 BC. 　Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, circa 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 　4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 　3500 BC. 　In the Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal, from aes cyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to cuprum (Latin). 　Coper (Old English) and copper were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530. 　Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. 　Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). 　Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. 　Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives. 　Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. 　In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. 　In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. 　The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat>Fat</a> 

<font size=3>
In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds, most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food. 　The term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals; or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. 　The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipid—any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. 　In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax), and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts. 　Fats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and the main components of common food products like milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt pork, and cooking oils. 　They are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions, in most living beings, including energy storage, waterproofing, and thermal insulation. 　The human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. 　Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.

<font size=3>
Germans (German: Deutsche, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃə] (listen)) are the natives or inhabitants of Germany, and sometimes more broadly any people who are of German descent or native speakers of the German language. 　The constitution of Germany defines a German as a German citizen. 　During the 19th and much of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture, descent, and history. 　Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary, though not exclusive, criterion of German identity. 　Estimates on the total number of Germans in the world range from 100 to 150 million, and most of them live in Germany. 　The history of Germans as an ethnic group began with the separation of a distinct Kingdom of Germany from the eastern part of the Frankish Empire under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th century, forming the core of the Holy Roman Empire. 　In subsequent centuries the political power and population of this empire grew considerably. 　It expanded eastwards, and eventually a substantial number of Germans migrated further eastwards into Eastern Europe. 　The empire itself was politically divided between many small princedoms, cities and bishoprics. 　Following the Reformation in the 16th century, many of these states found themselves in bitter conflict concerning the rise of Protestantism. 　The 19th century saw the dismemberment of the Holy Roman Empire and the growth of German nationalism. 　The kingdom of Prussia incorporated most of the Germans into its German Empire in 1871, while a substantial number of Germans also inhabited the multiethnic kingdom of Austria-Hungary. 　During this time a large number of Germans emigrated to the New World, particularly to the United States, Canada and Brazil, as well as establishing prominent communities in New Zealand and Australia. 　The Russian Empire also contained a substantial German population. 　In the aftermath of World War I, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire were partitioned, resulting in many Germans becoming ethnic minorities in newly established countries. 　In the chaotic years that followed, Adolf Hitler became the dictator of Nazi Germany and embarked on a genocidal campaign to unify all Germans under his leadership. 　This endeavour resulted in World War II and the Holocaust. 　In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in the war, the country was occupied and partitioned. 　Millions of Germans were expelled from Eastern Europe. 　In 1990, the states of West and East Germany were reunified. 　In modern times, remembrance of the Holocaust has become an integral part of German identity (Erinnerungskulturcode: deu promoted to code: de ). 　Owing to their long history of political fragmentation, the Germans are culturally diverse and often have strong regional identities. 　The arts and sciences are an integral part of German culture, and the Germans have produced a large number of prominent personalities in a number of disciplines.

<font size=3>
Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. 　Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. 　It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. 　Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. 　As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. 　Ψ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived (see below), is commonly associated with the science. 　A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. 　Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. 　Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. 　Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. 　Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. 　Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. 　They also consider the unconscious mind. 　Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. 　Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation. 　While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. 　By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. 　Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. 　Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. 　Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). 　Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. 　Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.

A voivodeship (/ˈvɔɪˌvoʊdˌʃɪp/) or voivodate is the area administered by a voivode (Governor) in several countries of central and eastern Europe. 　Voivodeships have existed since medieval times and the area of extent of voivodeship resembles that of a duchy in western medieval states, much as the title of voivode was equivalent to that of a duke. 　Other roughly equivalent titles and areas in medieval Eastern Europe included ban (bojan, vojin or bayan) and banate. 　In a modern context, the word normally refers to one of the provinces (województwa) of Poland. 　As of 2022[update], Poland has 16 voivodeships.

<font size=3>
Finland (Finnish: Suomi [ˈsuo̯mi] (listen); Swedish: Finland [ˈfɪ̌nland] (listen)), officially the Republic of Finland (Finnish: Suomen tasavalta; Swedish: Republiken Finland (listen to all)), is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. 　It shares land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south, across from Estonia. 　Finland covers an area of 338,455 square kilometres (130,678 sq mi) with a population of 5.6 million. 　Helsinki is the capital and largest city. 　The vast majority of the population are ethnic Finns. 　Finnish and Swedish are the official languages, Swedish is the native language of 5.2% of the population. 　Finland's climate varies from humid continental in the south to the boreal in the north. 　The land cover is primarily a boreal forest biome, with more than 180,000 recorded lakes. 　Finland was first inhabited around 9000 BC after the Last Glacial Period. 　The Stone Age introduced several different ceramic styles and cultures. 　The Bronze Age and Iron Age were characterized by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region. 　From the late 13th century, Finland became a part of Sweden as a consequence of the Northern Crusades. 　In 1809, as a result of the Finnish War, Finland became part of the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, during which Finnish art flourished and the idea of independence began to take hold. 　In 1906, Finland became the first European state to grant universal suffrage, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office. 　After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland declared independence from Russia. 　In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by the Finnish Civil War. 　During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War, and Nazi Germany in the Lapland War. 　It subsequently lost parts of its territory, but maintained its independence. 　Finland largely remained an agrarian country until the 1950s. 　After World War II, it rapidly industrialized and developed an advanced economy, while building an extensive welfare state based on the Nordic model; the country soon enjoyed widespread prosperity and a high per capita income. 　During the Cold War, Finland adopted an official policy of neutrality. 　Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and the Eurozone at its inception in 1999. 　Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life and human development. 　In 2015, Finland ranked first in the World Human Capital, topped the Press Freedom Index, and was the most stable country in the world during 2011–2016, according to the Fragile States Index; it is second in the Global Gender Gap Report, and has ranked first in every annual World Happiness Report since 2018.

Targets is a 1968 American crime thriller film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, produced by Roger Corman, and written by Polly Platt and Bogdanovich, with cinematography by László Kovács. 　The film depicts two parallel narratives which converge during the climax: one follows Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly), a seemingly ordinary and wholesome young man who embarks on an unprovoked killing spree; the other depicts Byron Orlok (Boris Karloff in his last straight dramatic role), an iconic horror film actor who is disillusioned by real-life violence and is contemplating retirement. 　Targets received generally positive reviews. 　It was included in the 2003 book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.

Eve (/ˈiːv/; Hebrew: חַוָּה‎‎, Modern: Ḥava, Tiberian: Ḥawwā; Arabic: حَوَّاء, romanized: Ḥawwāʾ; Greek: Εὕα, romanized: Heúa; Latin: Eva, Heva; Syriac: ܚܰܘܳܐ romanized: ḥawâ) is a figure in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. 　According to the origin story of the Abrahamic religions, she was the first woman, yet some debate within Judaism has also given that position to Lilith. 　Eve is known also as Adam's wife. 　According to the second chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. 　Adam is charged with guarding and keeping the garden before her creation; she is not present when God commands Adam not to eat the forbidden fruit – although it is clear that she was aware of the command. 　She decides to eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after she hears the serpent's argument that it would not kill her but bring her benefits. 　She shares the fruit with Adam, and before they could eat of the tree of life, they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. 　Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. 　Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a different level of responsibility for the "fall." 　The Catholic Church by ancient tradition recognizes Eve as a saint, alongside Adam, and the traditional liturgical feast of Saints Adam and Eve has been celebrated on 24 December since the Middle Ages in many European nations, including Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Scandinavian nations.

<font size=3>
A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, swimming, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. 　The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and recreational activities. 　A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. 　Some resorts are also condominium complexes that are timeshares or owned fractionally or wholly owned condominium. 　A resort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late 20th century, that sort of facility became more common. 　In British English, "resort" means a town which people visit for holidays and days out which usually contains hotels at which such holidaymakers stay. 　Examples would include Blackpool and Brighton.

<font size=3>
A patent is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention. 　In most countries, patent rights fall under private law and the patent holder must sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights. 　In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage; in others they are irrelevant.　: 17  The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. 　Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims that define the scope of protection that is being sought. 　A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. 　Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. 　Nevertheless, there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country, also among WTO member states. 　TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.

A signature (/ˈsɪɡnətʃər/; from Latin: signare, "to sign") is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple "X" or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent. 　The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer. 　Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator. 　A signature may be confused with an autograph, which is chiefly an artistic signature. 　This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.

A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often for orchestra. 　Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. 　Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section (violin, viola, cello, and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians. 　Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. 　Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument. 　Some symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).

<font size=3>
Brooklyn (/ˈbrʊklɪn/) is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Kings County, in the U.S. state of New York. 　Kings County is the most populous county in the State of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, behind New York County (Manhattan). 　Brooklyn is also New York City's most populous borough, with 2,736,074 residents in 2020. 　Named after the Dutch village of Breukelen, Brooklyn is located on the westernmost edge of Long Island and shares a border with the borough of Queens. 　It has several bridge and tunnel connections to the borough of Manhattan, across the East River, and is connected to Staten Island by way of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. 　With a land area of 70.82 square miles (183.4 km2) and a water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is the state of New York's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area. 　Brooklyn was founded by the Dutch in the 17th century and grew into a busy port city by the 19th century. 　On January 1, 1898, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, in accordance to the new Municipal Charter of "Greater New York", Brooklyn was consolidated in and annexed (along with other areas) to form the current five borough structure of New York City. 　The borough continues to maintain some distinct culture. 　Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves. 　Brooklyn's official motto, displayed on the Borough seal and flag, is Eendraght Maeckt Maght, which translates from early modern Dutch as "Unity makes strength." 　In the first decades of the 21st century, Brooklyn has experienced a renaissance as a destination for hipsters, with concomitant gentrification, dramatic house price increases, and a decrease in housing affordability. 　Some new developments are required to include affordable housing units. 　Since the 2010s, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship, high technology start-up firms, postmodern art and design.

<font size=3>
Jeans are a type of pants or trousers made from denim or dungaree cloth. 　Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style of trousers, called "blue jeans", with copper-riveted pockets which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in 1871 and patented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. 　Prior to the patent, the term "blue jeans" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim. 　"Jean" also references a (historic) type of sturdy cloth commonly made with a cotton warp and wool weft (also known as "Virginia cloth"). 　Jean cloth can be entirely cotton as well, similar to denim. 　Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. 　From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. 　Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of specialty trousers in Western culture. 　Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort>Comfort</a> 

<font size=3>
Comfort (or being comfortable) is a sense of physical or psychological ease, often characterized as a lack of hardship. 　Persons who are lacking in comfort are uncomfortable, or experiencing discomfort. 　A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant memories, such as engaging in familiar activities, maintaining the presence of familiar objects, and consumption of comfort foods. 　Comfort is a particular concern in health care, as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery. 　Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being "in their comfort zone". 　Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective. 　The use of "comfort" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of pain, suffering or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. 　Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with consolation or solace. 　However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. 　For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. 　Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being "comfy".

Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. 　It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. 　In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), an uneducated, small-time club fighter and debt collector gets an unlikely shot at the world heavyweight championship held by Apollo Creed (Weathers). 　Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. 　It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. 　Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks. 　With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, Rocky popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film. 　Rocky had its premiere in New York City on November 21, 1976, and was released in the United States on December 3. 　Rocky became the highest-grossing film of 1976, earning approximately $225 million worldwide. 　The film received critical acclaim toward Stallone's writing, performance, the story, as well as the film's direction, score, cinematography and editing; among other accolades, it received ten Academy Award nominations and won three, including Best Picture. 　It has been ranked by numerous publications as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as one of the most iconic sports film ever made. 　Rocky and its theme song have become a pop-cultural phenomenon and an important part of 1970s American popular culture spawning a franchise. 　In 2006, the Library of Congress selected Rocky for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

<font size=3>
In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different chemical substances which are not chemically bonded. 　A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions and colloids. 　Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. 　Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. 　Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. 　Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova>Nova</a> 

<font size=3>
A nova (plural novae or novas) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", which is Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months. 　Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. 　All observed novae involve white dwarfs in close binary systems. 　The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. 　They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. 　Classical nova eruptions are the most common type. 　They are likely created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a main sequence, subgiant, or red giant star. 　When the orbital period falls in the range of several days to one day, the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to start drawing accreted matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, which creates a dense but shallow atmosphere. 　This atmosphere, mostly consisting of hydrogen, is thermally heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature causing ignition of rapid runaway fusion. 　The sudden increase in energy expels the atmosphere into interstellar space creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event. 　Such were taken in past centuries to be a new star. 　A few novae produce short-lived nova remnants, lasting for perhaps several centuries. 　Recurrent nova processes are the same as the classical nova, except that the fusion ignition may be repetitive because the companion star can again feed the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf. 　Novae most often occur in the sky along the path of the Milky Way, especially near the observed Galactic Center in Sagittarius; however, they can appear anywhere in the sky. 　They occur far more frequently than galactic supernovae, averaging about ten per year in the Milky Way. 　Most are found telescopically, perhaps only one every 12–18 months reaching naked-eye visibility. 　Novae reaching first or second magnitude occur only several times per century. 　The last bright nova was V1369 Centauri reaching 3.3 magnitude on 14 December 2013.

Coordinates: 15°N 101°E﻿ / ﻿15°N 101°E﻿ / 15; 101 You may need rendering support to display the Thai text in this article correctly. 　Thailand (/ˈtaɪlænd, -lənd/ TY-land, -⁠lənd), historically known as Siam (/saɪˈæm, ˈsaɪæm/) and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia, located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million. 　The country is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the extremity of Myanmar. 　Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. 　Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city. 　Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century. 　Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. 　European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. 　Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. 　Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. 　He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. 　Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid colonization by foreign powers, although it was often forced to make territorial, trade and legal concessions in unequal treaties. 　The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of Chulalongkorn. 　In World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. 　Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II. 　In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. 　Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed SEATO, but from 1975 sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbours. 　Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. 　Since the 2000s the country has been caught in continual bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution, a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021 which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. 　Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on power. 　Thailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN, and ranks very high in the Human Development Index. 　It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 22nd-largest in the world by PPP. 　Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy, with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.

<font size=3>
Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. 　The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. 　The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). 　The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors. 　Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. 　There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. 　Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives. 　Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges. 　Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders.

<font size=3>
Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. 　It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture. 　Paint can be made in many colors—and in many different types. 　Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. 　Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics. 　For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers.　[citation needed] Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint. 　Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.) Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 °C (50 °F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 °C (35 °F).

<font size=3>
Islam (/ˈɪslɑːm/; Arabic: ۘالِإسلَام, al-ʾIslām [ɪsˈlaːm] (listen), transl. 　"Submission [to God]") is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion centered around the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad. 　Adherents of Islam, called Muslims, number approximately 1.9 billion globally and are the world's second-largest religious population after Christians. 　Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, among others; these earlier revelations are attributed to Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded in Islam as spiritual predecessor faiths. 　Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God and the unaltered, final revelation. 　They also consider Muhammad as the main and final Islamic prophet. 　The teachings and normative example of Muhammad, called the sunnah, documented in accounts called the hadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims. 　Islam teaches that God is one and incomparable. 　It states that there will be a "Final Judgement" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (jannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (jahannam). 　The Five Pillars—considered obligatory acts of worship—comprise the Islamic oath and creed (shahada); daily prayers (salah); almsgiving (zakat); fasting (sawm) in the month of Ramadan; and a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. 　Islamic law, sharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from banking and finance and welfare to men's and women's roles and the environment. 　Prominent religious festivals include Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. 　The three holiest sites in Islam in descending order are Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. 　Islam originated in the 7th century in Mecca. 　Muslim rule expanded outside Arabia under the Rashidun Caliphate and the subsequent Umayyad Caliphate ruled from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indus Valley. 　In the Islamic Golden Age, mostly during the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, much of the Muslim world experienced a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. 　The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and religious conversion as a result of Islamic missionary activities (dawah), and through conquests. 　There are two major Islamic denominations: Sunni Islam (85–90%) and Shia Islam (10–15%). 　While Sunni–Shia differences initially arose from disagreements over the succession to Muhammad, they grew to cover a broader dimension, both theologically and juridically. 　Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. 　Approximately 12% of the world's Muslims live in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country; 31% live in South Asia; 20% live in the Middle East–North Africa; and 15% live in sub-Saharan Africa. 　Sizable Muslim communities are also present in the Americas, China, and Europe. 　Due largely to a higher fertility rate, Islam is the world's fastest growing major religious group, and is projected to be the world's largest religion by the end of the 21st century.

<font size=3>
Corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. 　Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and the embezzlement and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries. 　Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts with an official capacity for personal gain. 　Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states.　[citation needed] Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions. 　Recent data suggests corruption is on the rise. 　Each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime. 　Strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. 　Additionally, global initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms.
