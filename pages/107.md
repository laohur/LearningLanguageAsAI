## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy>Hierarchy</a> 
<font size=3>
A hierarchy (from Greek: ἱεραρχία, hierarkhia, 'rule of a high priest', from hierarkhes, 'president of sacred rites') is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) that are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. 　Hierarchy is an important concept in a wide variety of fields, such as architecture, philosophy, design, mathematics, computer science, organizational theory, systems theory, systematic biology, and the social sciences (especially political philosophy). 　A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. 　The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. 　Hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path. 　All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. 　This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. 　Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. 　Heterarchy is one such form.

Santiago (/ˌsæntiˈɑːɡoʊ/, US also /ˌsɑːn-/; Spanish: [sanˈtjaɣo]), also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and largest city of Chile and one of the largest cities in the Americas. 　It is located in the country's central valley and is the center of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 8 million, representing nearly 40% of Chile's total population. 　Most of the city is situated between 500–650 m (1,640–2,133 ft) above sea level. 　Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has served as the capital city of Chile since colonial times. 　The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets featuring a mix of art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. 　Santiago's cityscape is defined by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, which is lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. 　The Andes Mountains can be seen from most parts of the city and contribute to a smog problem, particularly during winter, due to the lack of rain. 　The outskirts of the city are surrounded by vineyards, and Santiago is within an hour's drive of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 　Santiago is the political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. 　The Chilean executive and judiciary branches are based in Santiago, while the Congress mostly meets in nearby Valparaíso.

Look up premises in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　Premises are land and buildings together considered as a property. 　This usage arose from property owners finding the word in their title deeds, where it originally correctly meant "the aforementioned; what this document is about", from Latin prae-missus = "placed before".　[citation needed] In this sense, the word is always used in the plural, but singular in construction. 　Note that a single house or a single other piece of property is "premises", not a "premise", although the word "premises" is plural in form; e.g. "The equipment is on the customer's premises", never "The equipment is on the customer's premise".

Vegetation is an assemblage of plant species and the ground cover they provide. 　It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. 　It is broader than the term flora which refers to species composition. 　Perhaps the closest synonym is plant community, but vegetation can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. 　Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are encompassed by the term vegetation. 　The vegetation type is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality. 　The contemporary use of vegetation approximates that of ecologist Frederic Clements' term earth cover, an expression still used by the Bureau of Land Management.

<font size=3>
A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic energy. 　Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. 　In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis. 　When a pump contains two or more pump mechanisms with fluid being directed to flow through them in series, it is called a multi-stage pump. 　Terms such as two-stage or double-stage may be used to specifically describe the number of stages. 　A pump that does not fit this description is simply a single-stage pump in contrast. 　In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps.

<font size=3>
Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, photographic, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information. 　The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organisation, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work. 　The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. 　Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods. 　There are various editorial positions in publishing. 　Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. 　Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. 　The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap. 　The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor. 　A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. 　Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. 　In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor. 　In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). 　Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an acquisitions editor or a commissioning editor in a publishing house. 　Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor. 　Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style. 　Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors. 　At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. 　In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. 　At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor. 　They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. 　These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.

A fossil (from Classical Latin fossilis, lit. 'obtained by digging') is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. 　Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. 　The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record. 　Paleontology is the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. 　Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. 　The oldest fossils are around 3.48 billion years old to 4.1 billion years old. 　The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. 　The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host. 　There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration. 　Fossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1 µm) bacteria to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. 　A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. 　Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). 　These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils, as opposed to body fossils. 　Some fossils are biochemical and are called chemofossils or biosignatures.

<font size=3>
A chronicle (Latin: chronica, from Greek χρονικά chroniká, from χρόνος, chrónos – "time") is a historical account of events arranged in chronological order, as in a timeline. 　Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. 　A chronicle which traces world history is a universal chronicle. 　This is in contrast to a narrative or history, in which an author chooses events to interpret and analyze and excludes those the author does not consider important or relevant. 　The information sources for chronicles vary. 　Some are written from the chronicler's direct knowledge, others from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. 　Some used written material, such as charters, letters, and earlier chronicles. 　Still others are tales of unknown origin that have mythical status. 　Copyists also changed chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original chronicler. 　Determining the reliability of particular chronicles is important to historians. 　Many newspapers and other periodical literature have adopted "chronicle" as part of their name. 　Various fictional stories have also adopted "chronicle" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories.

Westminster is a city and area of Central London, England, within the larger City of Westminster, most notable for being the seat of the majority of government institutions in the United Kingdom. 　The area, which extends from the River Thames to Oxford Street, has many visitor attractions and historic landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and much of the West End shopping and entertainment district. 　The name (Old English: Westmynstre) originated from the informal description of the abbey church and royal peculiar of St Peter's (Westminster Abbey), west of the City of London (until the English Reformation there was also an Eastminster, near the Tower of London, in the East End of London). 　The abbey's origins date from between the 7th and 10th centuries, but it rose to national prominence when rebuilt by Edward the Confessor in the 11th. 　Westminster has been the home of England's government since about 1200, and from 1707 the Government of the United Kingdom. 　In 1539, it became a city. 　Westminster is often used as a metonym to refer to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in the Palace of Westminster.

An expense is an item requiring an outflow of money, or any form of fortune in general, to another person or group as payment for an item, service, or other category of costs. 　For a tenant, rent is an expense. 　For students or parents, tuition is an expense. 　Buying food, clothing, furniture, or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. 　An expense is a cost that is "paid" or "remitted", usually in exchange for something of value. 　Something that seems to cost a great deal is "expensive". 　Something that seems to cost little is "inexpensive". 　"Expenses of the table" are expenses for dining, refreshments, a feast, etc. 　In accounting, expense is any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. 　This outflow is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. 　Technically, an expense is an event in which a proprietary stake is diminished or exhausted, or a liability is incurred. 　In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners' equity. 　The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as: ...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants. 　Expense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.

A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or trike (if three-wheeled)) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat. 　Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. 　Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. 　The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. 　In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle. 　Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. 　In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period. 　In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. 　In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. 　Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.　[citation needed] According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.
