<font size=3>
Ash or ashes are the solid remnants of fires. 　Specifically, ash refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something burns. 　In analytical chemistry, to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples, ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after complete combustion. 　Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion are mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. 　The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc. 　The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal from incomplete combustion. 　The ashes are of different types. 　Some ashes contain natural compounds that make soil fertile. 　Others have chemical compounds that can be toxic but may break up in soil from chemical changes and microorganism activity. 　Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). 　The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as alternative when soap is not available.

<font size=3>
Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. 　It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established authority.　[citation needed] A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation.　[citation needed] Rebellion can be individual or collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance, and nonviolent resistance) or violent (terrorism, sabotage and guerrilla warfare).　[citation needed] Rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. 　While rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. 　The goal of rebellion is resistance while a revolt seeks a revolution.　[citation needed] As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed coalition, or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion>Diffusion</a> 

<font size=3>
Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy) generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. 　Diffusion is driven by a gradient in Gibbs free energy or chemical potential. 　It is possible to diffuse "uphill" from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, like in spinodal decomposition. 　The concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including physics (particle diffusion), chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). 　The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: a substance or collection undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that substance or collection. 　A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, pressure, or temperature with the change in another variable, usually distance. 　A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient, and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient. 　The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, diffundere, which means "to spread out." 　A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle random walk, and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. 　Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of advection. 　The term convection is used to describe the combination of both transport phenomena. 　If a diffusion process can be described by Fick's laws, it's called a normal diffusion (or Fickian diffusion); Otherwise, it's called an anomalous diffusion (or non-Fickian diffusion). 　When talking about the extent of diffusion, two length scales are used in two different scenarios: Brownian motion of an impulsive point source (for example, one single spray of perfume)—the square root of the mean squared displacement from this point. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 n D t {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2nDt}}} , where n {\displaystyle n} is the dimension of this Brownian motion; Constant concentration source in one dimension—the diffusion length. 　In Fickian diffusion, this is 2 D t {\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {Dt}}} .

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast>Breast</a> 

<font size=3>
The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso. 　Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. 　In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. 　Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape. 　At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. 　During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. 　Humans are the only animals with permanent breasts. 　At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause permanent breast growth in female humans. 　This happens only to a much lesser extent in other primates—breast development in other primates generally only occurs with pregnancy. 　Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. 　Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. 　They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness. 　A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. 　Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone.

<font size=3>
In archaeology, the general meaning of horizon is a distinctive type of sediment, artefact, style, or other cultural trait that is found across a large geographical area from a limited time period. 　The term derives from similar ones in geology, horizon or marker horizon, but where these have natural causes, archaeological horizons are caused by humans. 　Most typically, there is a change in the type of pottery found and in the style of less frequent major artefacts. 　Across a horizon, the same type of artefact or style is found very widely over a large area, and it can be assumed that these traces are approximately contemporary.

<font size=3>
In geology, a horizon is either a bedding surface where there is marked change in the lithology within a sequence of sedimentary or volcanic rocks, or a distinctive layer or thin bed with a characteristic lithology or fossil content within a sequence. 　Examples of the former can include things such as volcanic eruptions as well as things such as meteorite impacts and tsunamis. 　Examples of the latter include things such as ice ages and other large climate events, as well as large but temporary geological features and changes such as inland oceans. 　In the interpretation of seismic reflection data, horizons are the reflectors (or seismic events) picked on individual profiles. 　These reflectors represent a change in rock properties across a boundary between two layers of rock, particularly seismic velocity and density. 　It can also represent changes in the density of the material and the composition of it and the pressure under which it was produced. 　Thus, not only do the properties change but so too do the conditions of formation and other differences in the rock. 　The horizons can sometimes be very prominent, such as visible changes in cliff sides, to extremely subtle chemical differences.

<font size=3>
The horizon is the apparent curve that separates the surface of a celestial body from its sky when viewed from the perspective of an observer on or near the surface of the relevant body. 　This curve divides all viewing directions based on whether it intersects the relevant body's surface or not. 　The true horizon is a theoretical line, which can only be observed to any degree of accuracy when it lies along a relatively smooth surface such as that of Earth's oceans. 　At many locations, this line is obscured by terrain, and on Earth it can also be obscured by life forms such as trees and/or human constructs such as buildings. 　The resulting intersection of such obstructions with the sky is called the visible horizon. 　On Earth, when looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing. 　The true horizon surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle, drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the relevant celestial body, i.e., a small circle of the local osculating sphere. 　With respect to Earth, the center of the true horizon is below the observer and below sea level. 　Its radius or horizontal distance from the observer varies slightly from day to day due to atmospheric refraction, which is greatly affected by weather conditions. 　Also, the higher the observer's eyes are from sea level, the farther away the horizon is from the observer. 　For instance, in standard atmospheric conditions, for an observer with eye level above sea level by 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). 　When observed from very high standpoints, such as a space station, the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of Earth's surface. 　In this case, the horizon would no longer be a perfect circle, not even a plane curve such as an ellipse, especially when the observer is above the equator, as the Earth's surface can be better modeled as an oblate ellipsoid than as a sphere.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwing>Throwing</a> 

<font size=3>
Throwing is an action which consists in accelerating a projectile and then releasing it so that it follows a ballistic trajectory, usually with the aim of impacting a remote target. 　This action is best characterized for animals with prehensile limbs: in this case the projectile is grasped, while the limb segments impart a motion of the hand through compounded mechanical advantage. 　For other animals, the definition of throwing is somewhat unclear, as other actions such as spitting or spraying may or may not be included. 　Primates are the most capable throwers in the animal kingdom, and they typically throw feces as a form of agonistic behavior. 　Of all primates, humans are by far the most capable throwers. 　They throw a large variety of projectiles, with a much greater efficacy and accuracy. 　Humans have thrown projectiles for hunting and in warfare – first through rock-throwing, then refined weapon-throwing (e.g. spear), and into modern day with hand grenades and tear gas canisters. 　If humans initially threw objects by hand, they very early designed tools to improve the efficiency of their throwing techniques. 　The sling, the bow and arrow, and various models of catapults are notable examples of throwing mechanisms. 　With the advent of gun powder, research in throwing mechanisms as ranged weapons essentially halted, but throwing either by hand or with mechanical assistance has persisted for recreational purpose or as a form of exercise. 　Throwing is thus still performed in many sports and games, particularly ball games, and in throwing sports the action is the main determiner of the outcome.

Mechanics (from Ancient Greek: μηχανική, mēkhanikḗ, lit. "of machines") is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. 　Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment. 　Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). 　During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. 　As a branch of classical physics, mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 　It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy>Privacy</a> 

<font size=3>
Privacy (UK: /ˈprɪvəsiː/, US: /ˈpraɪ-/) is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. 　Etymology of the word privacy: the word privacy is derived from the Latin word "privatus" which means set apart from what is public, personal and belonging to oneself, and not to the state. 　The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. 　Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity. 　The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations, or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. 　The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern concept primarily associated with Western culture, particularly British and North American, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. 　Now, most cultures recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of personal information from wider society. 　With the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has shifted from a bodily sense to a digital sense. 　As the world has become digital, there have been conflicts regarding the legal right to privacy and where it is applicable. 　In most countries, the right to a reasonable expectation to digital privacy has been extended from the original right to privacy, and many countries, notably the US, under its agency, the Federal Trade Commission, and those within the European Union (EU), have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities and grant additional rights to users of technology. 　With the rise of the Internet, there has been an increase in the prevalence of social bots, causing political polarization and harassment. 　Online harassment has also spiked, particularly with teenagers, which has consequently resulted in multiple privacy breaches. 　Selfie culture, the prominence of networks like Facebook and Instagram, location technology, and the use of advertisements and their tracking methods also pose threats to digital privacy. 　Through the rise of technology and immensity of the debate regarding privacy, there have been various conceptions of privacy, which include the right to be let alone as defined in "The Right to Privacy", the first U.S. publication discussing privacy as a legal right, to the theory of the privacy paradox, which describes the notion that users' online may say they are concerned about their privacy, but in reality, are not. 　Along with various understandings of privacy, there are actions that reduce privacy, the most recent classification includes processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information, as defined by Daniel J. Solove. 　Conversely, in order to protect a user's privacy, multiple steps can be taken, specifically through practicing encryption, anonymity, and taking further measures to bolster the security of their data.

Muhammad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد; c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. 　According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. 　He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam. 　Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. 　Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE in Mecca. 　He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. 　His father Abdullah was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad's birth. 　His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. 　He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. 　In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. 　When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. 　In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam. 　Muhammad's followers were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists for 13 years. 　To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. 　This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. 　In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. 　In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. 　The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. 　In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. 　By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam. 　The revelations (each known as Ayah — literally, "Sign [of God]") that Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" on which the religion is based. 　Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira (biography) literature, are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law.

<font size=3>
The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic datum § Vertical datum). 　The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface. 　Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth. 　Due to the equatorial bulge, the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have, respectively, the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative>Narrative</a> 

<font size=3>
A narrative, story, or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional (memoir, biography, news report, documentary, travelogue, etc.) or fictional (fairy tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc.). 　Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words, through still or moving images, or through any combination of these. 　The word derives from the Latin verb narrare (to tell), which is derived from the adjective gnarus (knowing or skilled). 　Narration (i.e., the process of presenting a narrative) is a rhetorical mode of discourse, broadly defined (and paralleling argumentation, description, and exposition), is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. 　More narrowly defined, it is the fiction-writing mode[dubious – discuss] in which a narrator communicates directly to an audience. 　The school of literary criticism known as Russian formalism has applied methods that are more often used to analyse narrative fiction, to non-fictional texts such as political speeches. 　Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives. 　During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples. 　Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including speech, literature, theatre, music and song, comics, journalism, film, television and video, video games, radio, game-play, unstructured recreation, and performance in general, as well as some painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and other visual arts, as long as a sequence of events is presented. 　Several art movements, such as modern art, refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual. 　Narrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: nonfiction (such as creative nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript poetry, and historiography); fictionalization of historical events (such as anecdote, myth, legend, and historical fiction) and fiction proper (such as literature in the form of prose and sometimes poetry, short stories, novels, narrative poems and songs, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances). 　Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator (a character) typically found in the genre of noir fiction. 　An important part of many narratives is its narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a written or spoken commentary (see also "Aesthetics approach" below).

Coordinates: 39°N 111°W﻿ / ﻿39°N 111°W﻿ / 39; -111﻿ (State of Utah) Utah (/ˈjuːtɑː/ YOO-tah, /ˈjuːtɔː/ (listen) YOO-taw) is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. 　It is bordered to its east by Colorado, to its northeast by Wyoming, to its north by Idaho, to its south by Arizona, and to its west by Nevada. 　Utah also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. 　Of the fifty U.S. states, Utah is the 13th-largest by area; with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous and 11th-least-densely populated. 　Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly two-thirds of the population and includes the capital city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the southwest, with more than 180,000 residents. 　Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin. 　Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo and Ute. 　The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though the region's difficult geography and harsh climate made it a peripheral part of New Spain and later Mexico. 　Even while it was Mexican territory, many of Utah's earliest settlers were American, particularly Mormons fleeing marginalization and persecution from the United States. 　Following the Mexican–American War in 1848, the region was annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included what is now Colorado and Nevada. 　Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state; only after the outlawing of polygamy was it admitted in 1896 as the 45th. 　People from Utah are known as Utahns. 　Slightly over half of all Utahns are Mormons, the vast majority of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City; Utah is the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church. 　The LDS Church greatly influences Utahn culture, politics, and daily life, though since the 1990s the state has become more religiously diverse as well as secular. 　Utah has a highly diversified economy, with major sectors including transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, and tourism. 　Utah has been one of the fastest growing states since 2000, with the 2020 U.S. census confirming the fastest population growth in the nation since 2010. 　St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005. 　Utah ranks among the overall best states in metrics such as healthcare, governance, education, and infrastructure. 　It has the 14th-highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. 　Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Utah have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Utah's water security and impacting the state’s economy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_(sociology)>Distinction (sociology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In sociology, distinction is a social force whereby people use various strategies—consciously or not—to differentiate and distance themselves from others in society, and to assign themselves greater value in the process. 　In Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (La Distinction, 1979), Pierre Bourdieu described how those in power define aesthetic concepts like "good taste", with the consequence that the social class of a person tends to predict and in fact determine his or her cultural interests, likes, and dislikes. 　Political and socio-economic, racial and gender distinctions, based upon social class, are reinforced in daily life within society. 　In The Rebel Sell: Why the Culture Can't be Jammed (2004), Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter describe "distinction" as a social competition in which the styles of social fashion are in continual development, and that the men and women who do not follow the development of social trends soon become stale, and irrelevant to their social-class stratum.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron>Neutron</a> 

<font size=3>
The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol n or n0 , which has a neutral (not positive or negative) charge, and a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. 　Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms. 　Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, they are both referred to as nucleons. 　Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. 　Protons and neutrons are not elementary particles; each is composed of three quarks. 　The chemical properties of an atom are mostly determined by the configuration of electrons that orbit the atom's heavy nucleus. 　The electron configuration is determined by the charge of the nucleus, which is determined by the number of protons, or atomic number. 　The number of neutrons is the neutron number. 　Neutrons do not affect the electron configuration, but the sum of atomic and neutron numbers is the mass of the nucleus. 　Atoms of a chemical element that differ only in neutron number are called isotopes. 　For example, carbon, with atomic number 6, has an abundant isotope carbon-12 with 6 neutrons and a rare isotope carbon-13 with 7 neutrons. 　Some elements occur in nature with only one stable isotope, such as fluorine; Other elements occur with many stable isotopes, such as tin with ten stable isotopes, and some elements such as technetium have no stable isotope. 　The properties of an atomic nucleus depend on both atomic and neutron numbers. 　With their positive charge, the protons within the nucleus are repelled by the long-range electromagnetic force, but the much stronger, but short-range, nuclear force binds the nucleons closely together. 　Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei, with the exception of the single-proton hydrogen nucleus. 　Neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear fission and fusion. 　They are a primary contributor to the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements within stars through fission, fusion, and neutron capture processes. 　The neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power. 　In the decade after the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, neutrons were used to induce many different types of nuclear transmutations. 　With the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938, it was quickly realized that, if a fission event produced neutrons, each of these neutrons might cause further fission events, in a cascade known as a nuclear chain reaction. 　These events and findings led to the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor (Chicago Pile-1, 1942) and the first nuclear weapon (Trinity, 1945). 　Dedicated neutron sources like neutron generators, research reactors and spallation sources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in neutron scattering experiments. 　A free neutron spontaneously decays to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes. 　Free neutrons do not directly ionize atoms, but they do indirectly cause ionizing radiation, so they can be a biological hazard, depending on dose. 　A small natural "neutron background" flux of free neutrons exists on Earth, caused by cosmic ray showers, and by the natural radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable elements in the Earth's crust.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared>Infrared</a> 

<font size=3>
Infrared (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light and shorter than radio waves. 　It is therefore invisible to the human eye. 　IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from around 1 millimeter (300 GHz) to the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum, around 700 nanometers (430 THz).　[verification needed] Longer IR wavelengths (30 μm-100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation range. 　Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is at infrared wavelengths. 　As a form of electromagnetic radiation, IR propagates energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon. 　It was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. 　In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. 　Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. 　The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate. 　Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. 　It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. 　Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range. 　Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. 　Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. 　Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. 　Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect the overheating of electrical components. 　Military and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. 　Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm (micrometers). 　Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.

Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk. 　They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms. 　Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat. 　As of August 2022[update], 50,356 spider species in 132 families have been recorded by taxonomists. 　However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900. 　Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, however, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax. 　Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen. 　Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. 　In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. 　Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure. 　Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands. 　Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used. 　It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders. 　Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago, but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets. 　True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago, and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae. 　The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before 200 million years ago. 　The species Bagheera kiplingi was described as herbivorous in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. 　It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. 　Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. 　Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. 　Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, so they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. 　They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have. 　To avoid being eaten by the females, which are typically much larger, male spiders identify themselves to potential mates by a variety of complex courtship rituals. 　Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. 　Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. 　Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. 　A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. 　Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. 　Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity. 　While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. 　Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories. 　As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. 　An irrational fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.

<font size=3>
Phi (/faɪ/; uppercase Φ, lowercase φ or ϕ; Ancient Greek: ϕεῖ pheî [pʰéî̯]; Modern Greek: φι fi [fi]) is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet. 　In Archaic and Classical Greek (c. 9th century BC to 4th century BC), it represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive ([pʰ]), which was the origin of its usual romanization as ⟨ph⟩. 　During the later part of Classical Antiquity, in Koine Greek (c. 4th century BC to 4th century AD), its pronunciation shifted to that of a voiceless bilabial fricative ([ɸ]), and by the Byzantine Greek period (c. 4th century AD to 15th century AD) it developed its modern pronunciation as a voiceless labiodental fricative ([f]). 　The romanization of the Modern Greek phoneme is therefore usually ⟨f⟩. 　It may be that phi originated as the letter qoppa (Ϙ, ϙ), and initially represented the sound /kʷʰ/ before shifting to Classical Greek [pʰ]. 　In traditional Greek numerals, phi has a value of 500 (φʹ) or 500,000 (͵φ). 　The Cyrillic letter Ef (Ф, ф) descends from phi. 　As with other Greek letters, lowercase phi (encoded as the Unicode character U+03C6 φ GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI) is used as a mathematical or scientific symbol. 　Some uses, such as the golden ratio,[contradictory] require the old-fashioned 'closed' glyph, which is separately encoded as the Unicode character U+03D5 ϕ GREEK PHI SYMBOL.

<font size=3>
Hampshire (/ˈhæmpʃər/, /-ʃɪər/ (listen); abbreviated to Hants) is a ceremonial and non-metropolitan county in western South East England on the coast of the English Channel. 　Home to approximately 1.9 million people, Hampshire is the 5th-most populous county in England. 　Its largest settlements are the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. 　The county town is Winchester. 　It is bordered by Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, Wiltshire to the north-west, West Sussex to the south-east, and Dorset to the south-west. 　The county contains two national parks: the New Forest and part of the South Downs, which together cover 45 per cent of Hampshire. 　Settled about 14,000 years ago, Hampshire's recorded history dates to Roman Britain, when its chief town was Venta Belgarum (now Winchester). 　The county was recorded in Domesday Book as divided into 44 hundreds. 　From the 12th century, the ports settlements grew due to increasing trade with the European mainland resulting from the wool and cloth, fishing, and shipbuilding industries. 　This meant by the 16th century, Southampton had become more populous than Winchester. 　In 20th century conflicts, including World War One and Two, Hampshire played a crucial military role due to its ports. 　At present, the county is divided into 13 non-metropolitan districts. 　Southampton and Portsmouth are unitary authorities and 7 hold borough status. 　This means that with the exceptions of Southampton and Portsmouth, the county is locally governed by a combination of the County Council and non-metropolitan district councils. 　In 1974, the Isle of Wight was made a separate ceremonial county from Hampshire and the towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch were transferred to Dorset. 　Hampshire is the home of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Florence Nightingale, and the birthplace of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_(geology)>Bench (geology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In geomorphology, geography and geology, a bench or benchland is a long, relatively narrow strip of relatively level or gently inclined land that is bounded by distinctly steeper slopes above and below it. 　Benches can be of different origins and created by very different geomorphic processes. 　First, the differential erosion of rocks or sediments of varying hardness and resistance to erosion can create benches. 　Earth scientists called such benches "structural benches." 　Second, other benches are narrow fluvial terraces created by the abandonment of a floodplain by a river or stream and entrenchment of the river valley into it. 　Finally, a bench is also the name of a narrow flat area often seen at the base of a sea cliff that was created by waves or other physical or chemical erosion near the shoreline. 　These benches are typically referred to as either "coastal benches," "wave-cut benches," or "wave-cut platforms." 　In mining, a bench is a narrow, strip of land cut into the side of an open-pit mine. 　These step-like zones are created along the walls of an open-pit mine for access and mining.

Coordinates: 8°N 10°E﻿ / ﻿8°N 10°E﻿ / 8; 10 Nigeria (/naɪˈdʒɪəriə/ ny-JEER-ee-ə), officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a country in West Africa. 　It is situated between the Sahel to the north and the Gulf of Guinea to the south in the Atlantic Ocean. 　It covers an area of 923,769 square kilometres (356,669 sq mi), and with a population of over 225 million, it is the most populous country in Africa, and the world's sixth-most populous country. 　Nigeria borders Niger in the north, Chad in the northeast, Cameroon in the east, and Benin in the west. 　Nigeria is a federal republic comprising 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where the capital, Abuja, is located. 　The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and the second-largest in Africa. 　Nigeria has been home to several indigenous pre-colonial states and kingdoms since the second millennium BC, with the Nok civilization in the 15th century BC, marking the first internal unification in the country. 　The modern state originated with British colonialization in the 19th century, taking its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Lugard. 　The British set up administrative and legal structures while practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms in the Nigeria region. 　Nigeria became a formally independent federation on 1 October 1960. 　It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970, followed by a succession of military dictatorships and democratically elected civilian governments until achieving a stable democracy in the 1999 presidential election. 　The 2015 general election was the first time an incumbent president failed to be re-elected. 　Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all identifying with a wide variety of cultures. 　The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in the east, together constituting over 60% of the total population. 　The official language is English, chosen to facilitate linguistic unity at the national level. 　Nigeria's constitution ensures freedom of religion and it is home to some of the world's largest Muslim and Christian populations. 　Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Muslims, who live mostly in the north, and Christians, who live mostly in the south; indigenous religions, such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities, are in the minority. 　Nigeria is a regional power in Africa and a middle and emerging power in international affairs. 　Nigeria's economy is the largest in Africa, the 31st-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 26th-largest by PPP. 　Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa owing to its large population and economy and is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank. 　However, the country ranks very low in the Human Development Index and remains one of the most corrupt nations in the world. 　Nigeria is a founding member of the African Union and a member of many international organizations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, NAM, the Economic Community of West African States, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and OPEC. 　It is also a member of the informal MINT group of countries and is one of the Next Eleven economies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino>Neutrino</a> 

<font size=3>
A neutrino (/njuːˈtriːnoʊ/ new-TREE-noh; denoted by the Greek letter ν) is a fermion (an elementary particle with spin of 1/2) that interacts only via the weak interaction and gravity. 　The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was long thought to be zero. 　The rest mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles excluding massless particles. 　The weak force has a very short range, the gravitational interaction is extremely weak due to the very small mass of the neutrino, and neutrinos do not participate in the strong interaction. 　Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected. 　Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors: electron neutrinos ( ν e), muon neutrinos ( ν μ), or tau neutrinos ( ν τ), in association with the corresponding charged lepton. 　Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses with different tiny values (the smallest of which may even be zero), but the three masses do not uniquely correspond to the three flavors. 　A neutrino created with a specific flavor is a specific mixture of all three mass states (a quantum superposition). 　Similar to some other neutral particles, neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight as a consequence. 　For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino. 　The three mass values are not yet known as of 2022, but laboratory experiments and cosmological observations have determined the differences of their squares, an upper limit on their sum (< 2.14×10−37 kg), and an upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino. 　For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding antiparticle, called an antineutrino, which also has spin of 1/2 and no electric charge. 　Antineutrinos are distinguished from neutrinos by having opposite-signed lepton number and weak isospin, and right-handed instead of left-handed chirality. 　To conserve total lepton number (in nuclear beta decay), electron neutrinos only appear together with positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, whereas electron antineutrinos only appear with electrons or electron neutrinos. 　Neutrinos are created by various radioactive decays; the following list is not exhaustive, but includes some of those processes: beta decay of atomic nuclei or hadrons, natural nuclear reactions such as those that take place in the core of a star artificial nuclear reactions in nuclear reactors, nuclear bombs, or particle accelerators during a supernova during the spin-down of a neutron star when cosmic rays or accelerated particle beams strike atoms. 　The majority of neutrinos which are detected about the Earth are from nuclear reactions inside the Sun. 　At the surface of the Earth, the flux is about 65 billion (6.5×1010) solar neutrinos, per second per square centimeter. 　Neutrinos can be used for tomography of the interior of the earth.

<font size=3>
A wire is a flexible strand of metal. 　Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate. 　Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number or cross-sectional area. 　Wires are used to bear mechanical loads, often in the form of wire rope. 　In electricity and telecommunications signals, a "wire" can refer to an electrical cable, which can contain a "solid core" of a single wire or separate strands in stranded or braided forms. 　Usually cylindrical in geometry, wire can also be made in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency voice coils in loudspeakers. 　Edge-wound coil springs, such as the Slinky toy, are made of special flattened wire.

<font size=3>
Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and water, usually by baking. 　Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures' diet. 　It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture. 　Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. 　In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.

<font size=3>
Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt. and capitalized when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. 　The alternative spelling, serjeant, is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British light infantry. 　Its origin is the Latin serviens, 'one who serves', through the French term sergeant. 　The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal, and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant in the US, and below an inspector in the UK. 　In most armies, the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad (or section). 　In Commonwealth armies, it is a more senior rank, corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command. 　In the United States Army, sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a squad- (12 person) or platoon- (36 person) leader. 　More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant, for example staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant, master sergeant, first sergeant, and sergeant major. 　In many nations and services, the rank insignia for a sergeant often features three chevrons.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty>Poverty</a> 

<font size=3>
Poverty is a state or condition in which a person lacks the financial resources and essentials for a certain standard of living. 　Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects. 　When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter; relative poverty measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. 　The definition of relative poverty varies from one country to another, or from one society to another. 　Statistically, as of 2019[update], most of the world's population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day now changed to 2.15$/day.　(extreme poverty). 　According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries. 　Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty. 　Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas. 　The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: "No Poverty". 　Social forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty—with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty. 　Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events. 　Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict. 　For this reason, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus>Virus</a> 

<font size=3>
A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. 　Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. 　Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 9,000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail. 　Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. 　The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology. 　When infected, a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. 　When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent viral particles, or virions, consisting of 　(i) the genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; 　(ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases 　(iii) an outside envelope of lipids. 　The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. 　Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria. 　The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. 　In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. 　Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life. 　Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life" and as replicators. 　Viruses spread in many ways. 　One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. 　Many viruses, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles, spread in the air by coughing and sneezing. 　Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. 　The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles. 　HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. 　The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range. 　This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many. 　Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. 　Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. 　Some viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. 　Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm>Rhythm</a> 

<font size=3>
Rhythm (from Greek ῥυθμός, rhythmos, "any regular recurring motion, symmetry") generally means a "movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions". 　This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. 　Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats: Rhythm may be defined as the way in which one or more unaccented beats are grouped in relation to an accented one. 　... 　A rhythmic group can be apprehended only when its elements are distinguished from one another, rhythm...always involves an interrelationship between a single, accented (strong) beat and either one or two unaccented (weak) beats. 　In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. 　In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. 　Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as "timed movement through space" and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry. 　For example, architects often speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the façade.　[citation needed] In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. 　Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, Christopher Hasty, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester, and Guerino Mazzola.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood>Flood</a> 

<font size=3>
A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. 　In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. 　Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. 　Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. 　In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk. 　Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. 　While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals. 　Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. 　Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. 　While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. 　Flooding can lead to secondary consequences in addition to damage to property, such as long-term displacement of residents and creating increased spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne disesases transmitted by mosquitos.

<font size=3>
Sultan (/ˈsʌltən/; Arabic: سلطان sulṭān, pronounced [sʊlˈtˤɑːn, solˈtˤɑːn]) is a position with several historical meanings. 　Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning "strength", "authority", "rulership", derived from the verbal noun سلطة sulṭah, meaning "authority" or "power". 　Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty (i.e., not having dependence on any higher ruler) without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. 　The adjectival form of the word is "sultanic", and the state and territories ruled by a sultan, as well as his office, are referred to as a sultanate (سلطنة salṭanah). 　The term is distinct from king (ملك malik), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. 　The use of "sultan" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular king, which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. 　Brunei and Oman are the only independent countries which retain the title "sultan" for their monarchs. 　In recent years, the title has been gradually replaced by "king" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. 　A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient>Gradient</a> 

<font size=3>
In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function f of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} whose value at a point p {\displaystyle p} is the "direction and rate of fastest increase". 　If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative. 　Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. 　The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to maximize a function by gradient ascent. 　In coordinate-free terms, the gradient of a function f ( r ) {\displaystyle f({\bf {{r})}}} may be defined by: d f = ∇ f ⋅ d r {\displaystyle df=\nabla f\cdot d{\bf {r}}} where df is the total infinitesimal change in f for an infinitesimal displacement d r {\displaystyle d{\bf {r}}} , and is seen to be maximal when d r {\displaystyle d{\bf {r}}} is in the direction of the gradient ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} . 　The nabla symbol ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } , written as an upside-down triangle and pronounced "del", denotes the vector differential operator. 　When a coordinate system is used in which the basis vectors are not functions of position, the gradient is given by the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of f {\displaystyle f} at p {\displaystyle p} . 　That is, for f : R n → R {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } , its gradient ∇ f : R n → R n {\displaystyle \nabla f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is defined at the point p = ( x 1 , … , x n ) {\displaystyle p=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} in n-dimensional space as the vector ∇ f ( p ) = [ ∂ f ∂ x 1 ( p ) ⋮ ∂ f ∂ x n ( p ) ] . 　{\displaystyle \nabla f(p)={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}}(p)\\\vdots \\{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}}(p)\end{bmatrix}}.　} The gradient is dual to the total derivative d f {\displaystyle df} : the value of the gradient at a point is a tangent vector – a vector at each point; while the value of the derivative at a point is a cotangent vector – a linear functional on vectors. 　They are related in that the dot product of the gradient of f at a point p with another tangent vector v equals the directional derivative of f at p of the function along v; that is, ∇ f ( p ) ⋅ v = ∂ f ∂ v ( p ) = d f p ( v ) {\textstyle \nabla f(p)\cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {v} }}(p)=df_{p}(\mathbf {v} )} . 　The gradient admits multiple generalizations to more general functions on manifolds; see § Generalizations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone>Telephone</a> 

<font size=3>
A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly. 　A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. 　The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice. 　A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use early in the telephone's history. 　In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device. 　This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households. 　The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice at a distant location. 　The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. 　The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telecommunication system to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker. 　Telephones permit transmission in both directions simultaneously. 　Most telephones also contain an alerting feature, such as a ringer or a visual indicator, to announce an incoming telephone call. 　Telephone calls are initiated most commonly with a keypad or dial, affixed to the telephone, to enter a telephone number, which is the address of the call recipient's telephone in the telecommunication system, but other methods existed in the early history of the telephone. 　The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. 　Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. 　These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network. 　For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century. 　Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. 　In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost. 　Convergence in communication services has provided a broad spectrum of capabilities in cell phones, including mobile computing, giving rise to the smartphone, the dominant type of telephone in the world today.

A vacuum is a space devoid of matter. 　The word is derived from the Latin adjective vacuus for "vacant" or "void". 　An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. 　Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. 　In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is considerably lower than atmospheric pressure. 　The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum. 　The quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. 　Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. 　For example, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20%. 　But higher-quality vacuums are possible. 　Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm3. 　Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average in intergalactic space. 　Vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient Greek times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. 　Evangelista Torricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. 　A Torricellian vacuum is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury (see below). 　Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes, and a wide array of vacuum technologies has since become available. 　The development of human spaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck>Luck</a> 

<font size=3>
Luck is the phenomenon and belief that defines the experience of improbable events, especially improbably positive or negative ones. 　The naturalistic interpretation is that positive and negative events may happen at any time, both due to random and non-random natural and artificial processes, and that even improbable events can happen by random chance. 　In this view, the epithet "lucky" or "unlucky" is a descriptive label that refers to an event's positivity, negativity, or improbability. 　Supernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of a person or object, or the result of a favorable or unfavorable view of a deity upon a person. 　These interpretations often prescribe how luckiness or unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or offering sacrifices or prayers to a deity. 　Saying someone is "born lucky" may hold different meanings, depending on the interpretation: it could simply mean that they have been born into a good family or circumstance; or that they habitually experience improbably positive events, due to some inherent property, or due to the lifelong favor of a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion. 　Many superstitions are related to luck, though these are often specific to a given culture or set of related cultures, and sometimes contradictory. 　For example, lucky symbols include the number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures, the number 8 in Chinese-influenced cultures. 　Unlucky symbols and events include entering and leaving a house by different doors or breaking a mirror in Greek culture, throwing rocks into the wind in Navajo culture, and ravens in Western culture. 　Some of these associations may derive from related facts or desires. 　For example, in Western culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work. 　In Chinese and Japanese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky. 　Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and systems of astrology in various cultures around the world. 　Many polytheistic religions have specific gods or goddesses that are associated with luck, both good and bad, including Fortuna and Felicitas in the Ancient Roman religion (the former related to the words "fortunate" and "unfortunate" in English), Dedun in Nubian religion, the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology, mythical American serviceman John Frum in Polynesian cargo cults, and the inauspicious Alakshmi in Hinduism.

Ra (/rɑː/; Ancient Egyptian: rꜥ; also transliterated rꜥw /ˈɾiːʕuw/; cuneiform: 𒊑𒀀 ri-a or 𒊑𒅀ri-ia; Phoenician: 𐤓𐤏, romanized: rʿ) or Re (/reɪ/; Coptic: ⲣⲏ, romanized: Rē) was the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun. 　By the Fifth Dynasty, in the 25th and 24th centuries BC, he had become one of the most important gods in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon-day sun. 　Ra ruled in all parts of the created world: the sky, the earth, and the underworld. 　He was the god of the sun, order, kings and the sky. 　Ra was portrayed as a falcon and shared characteristics with the sky-god Horus. 　At times the two deities were merged as Ra-Horakhty, "Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons". 　In the New Kingdom, when the god Amun rose to prominence he was fused with Ra as Amun-Ra. 　The cult of the Mnevis bull, an embodiment of Ra, had its center in Heliopolis and there was a formal burial ground for the sacrificed bulls north of the city. 　All forms of life were believed to have been created by Ra. 　In some accounts, humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves the "Cattle of Ra". 　In the myth of the Celestial Cow, it is recounted how mankind plotted against Ra and how he sent his eye as the goddess Sekhmet to punish them.

Glasgow (UK: /ˈɡlɑːzɡoʊ, ˈɡlæz-, ˈɡlɑːs-, ˈɡlæs-/ GLA(H)Z-goh, GLA(H)SS-; Scots: Glesca [ˈɡleskə] or Glesga [ˈɡlezɡə]; Scottish Gaelic: Glaschu [ˈkl̪ˠas̪əxu]) is the most populous city in Scotland and the fourth-most populous city in the United Kingdom, as well as being the 27th largest city by population in Europe. 　In 2020, it had an estimated population of 635,640. 　The city was made a county of itself in 1893, prior to which it had been in the historic county of Lanarkshire. 　The city now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is governed by Glasgow City Council. 　It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. 　Glasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and the third-highest GDP per capita of any city in the UK. 　Glasgow's major cultural institutions – the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera – enjoy international reputations. 　The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. 　It is the fifth-most visited city in the United Kingdom. 　The city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. 　Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018, and was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020. 　The city is also well known in the sporting world for football, particularly for the Old Firm rivalry. 　Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. 　Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. 　From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. 　With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. 　Glasgow was the "Second City of the British Empire" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. 　In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938. 　The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. 　Over 985,200 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population. 　The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2.

<font size=3>
Animation is a method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. 　In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. 　Today, many animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). 　Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. 　Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures. 　A cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. 　The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists. 　Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life. 　The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. 　The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. 　While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment. 　Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. 　Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. 　For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed. 　In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects. 　The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance, moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. 　The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. 　Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.

A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. 　It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.　[citation needed] The term is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. 　Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size. 　Although experimental submarines had been built earlier, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and they were adopted by several navies. 　They were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918), and are now used in many navies, large and small. 　Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military) or other submarines, and for aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, nuclear deterrence, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example, using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces. 　Civilian uses include marine science, salvage, exploration, and facility inspection and maintenance. 　Submarines can also be modified for specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions and undersea cable repair. 　They are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology. 　Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe, which evolved from the diving bell. 　Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, that houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. 　In modern submarines, this structure is the "sail" in American usage and "fin" in European usage. 　A "conning tower" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. 　There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. 　Smaller, deep-diving, and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design. 　Submarines dive and resurface by means of diving planes and changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy. 　Submarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities. 　They include small autonomous examples using A-Navigation and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours, to vessels that can remain submerged for six months—such as the Russian Typhoon class, the biggest submarines ever built. 　Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human divers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing>Pointing</a> 

<font size=3>
Pointing is a gesture specifying a direction from a person's body, usually indicating a location, person, event, thing or idea. 　It typically is formed by extending the arm, hand, and index finger, although it may be functionally similar to other hand gestures. 　Types of pointing may be subdivided according to the intention of the person, as well as by the linguistic function it serves. 　Pointing typically develops within the first two years of life in humans, and plays an important role in language development and reading in children. 　It is central to the use of sign language, with a large number of signs being some variation on pointing. 　The nature of pointing may differ for children who have autism or who are deaf, and may also vary by gender. 　It is typically not observed in children who are blind from birth. 　Pointing may vary substantially across cultures, with some having many distinct types of pointing, both with regard to the physical gestures employed and their interpretation. 　Pointing, especially at other people, may be considered inappropriate or rude in certain contexts and in many cultures. 　It is generally regarded as a species-specific human feature that does not normally occur in other primates in the wild. 　It has been observed in animals in captivity; however, there is disagreement on the nature of this non-human pointing.

<font size=3>
Look up tensor in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. 　Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors. 　There are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product. 　Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system. 　Tensors have become important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as mechanics (stress, elasticity, fluid mechanics, moment of inertia, ...), electrodynamics (electromagnetic tensor, Maxwell tensor, permittivity, magnetic susceptibility, ...), general relativity (stress–energy tensor, curvature tensor, ...) and others. 　In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. 　This leads to the concept of a tensor field. 　In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are often simply called "tensors". 　Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro popularised tensors in 1900 – continuing the earlier work of Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel and others – as part of the absolute differential calculus. 　The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of the Riemann curvature tensor.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi>Delhi</a> 

<font size=3>
Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. 　Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. 　The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). 　According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million. 　Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). 　The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. 　From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. 　All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. 　Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. 　The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. 　The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of the Urdu language and then of Modern Standard Hindi. 　Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. 　Delhi was a major centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 　In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. 　During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu refugees from western Punjab. 　After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India. 　Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index. 　Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa). 　Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. 　New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. 　Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an "interstate regional planning" area created in 1985. 　Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

<font size=3>
Theories of consumption have been a part of the field of sociology since its earliest days, dating back, at least implicitly, to the work of Karl Marx in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. 　Sociologists view consumption as central to everyday life, identity and social order. 　Many sociologists associate it with social class, identity, group membership, age and stratification as it plays a huge part in modernity. 　Thorstein Veblen's (1899) The Theory of the Leisure Class is generally seen as the first major theoretical work to take consumption as its primary focus. 　Despite these early roots, research on consumption began in earnest in the second half of the twentieth century in Europe, especially Great Britain. 　Interest in the topic among mainstream US sociologists was much slower to develop and it is still not[when?] a focal concern of many American sociologists. 　Efforts are currently[when?] underway to form a section in the American Sociological Association devoted to the study of consumption. 　However, over the last[when?] twenty years, sociological research into the area of consumption has burgeoned in cognate fields, particularly in global and cultural studies: The processes associated with globalization have created hitherto unimaginable opportunities for cultural forms and practices to travel far beyond the indigenous sites and spaces in which they were first conceived and produced. 　While there have always been cultural movements and flows from one space to another, the intensity and ease of contemporary intersections of the global and the local have forced scholars to look closely at the myriad ways in which culture is consumed – used up, made sense of, embraced, and explored. 　Modern theorists of consumption include Jean Baudrillard, Pierre Bourdieu, and George Ritzer.

<font size=3>
The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 　It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 　It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 　It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 　A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 　Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 　The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. 　The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. 　It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 　During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. 　It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. 　Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 　Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. 　One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 　Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. 　Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

In psychology, a mood is an affective state. 　In contrast to emotions or feelings, moods are less specific, less intense and less likely to be provoked or instantiated by a particular stimulus or event. 　Moods are typically described as having either a positive or negative valence. 　In other words, people usually talk about being in a good mood or a bad mood. 　There are many different factors that influence mood, and these can lead to positive or negative effects on mood. 　Mood also differs from temperament or personality traits which are even longer-lasting. 　Nevertheless, personality traits such as optimism and neuroticism predispose certain types of moods. 　Long term disturbances of mood such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder are considered mood disorders. 　Mood is an internal, subjective state but it often can be inferred from posture and other behaviors. 　"We can be sent into a mood by an unexpected event, from the happiness of seeing an old friend to the anger of discovering betrayal by a partner. We may also just fall into a mood."

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute>Tribute</a> 

<font size=3>
A tribute (/ˈtrɪbjuːt/; from Latin tributum, "contribution") is wealth, often in kind, that a party gives to another as a sign of submission, allegiance or respect. 　Various ancient states exacted tribute from the rulers of land which the state conquered or otherwise threatened to conquer. 　In case of alliances, lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance and often in order to finance projects that would benefit both parties. 　To be called "tribute" a recognition by the payer of political submission to the payee is normally required; the large sums, essentially protection money, paid by the later Roman and Byzantine Empires to barbarian peoples to prevent them attacking imperial territory, would not usually be termed "tribute" as the Empire accepted no inferior political position. 　Payments by a superior political entity to an inferior one, made for various purposes, are described by terms including "subsidy". 　The ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire is an example of an ancient tribute empire; one that made relatively few demands on its non-Persian subjects other than the regular payment of tribute, which might be gold, luxury goods, animals, soldiers or slaves. 　However, failure to keep up the payments had dire consequences. 　The reliefs at Persepolis show processions of figures bearing varied types of tribute. 　The medieval Mongol rulers of Russia also expected only tribute from the Russian states, which continued to govern themselves. 　Athens received tribute from the other cities of the Delian League. 　The empires of Assyria, Babylon, Carthage and Rome exacted tribute from their provinces and subject kingdoms. 　Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and Central Asia (listed here). 　The Roman republic exacted tribute in the form of payments equivalent to proportional property taxes, for the purpose of waging war. 　Tribute empires contrast with those like the Roman Empire, which more closely controlled and garrisoned subject territories. 　A tributary state is one that preserves its political position and such independence as it has only by paying tribute. 　Although, Roman Republic and Roman Empire sometimes controlled client kingdoms providing it with tribute.

<font size=3>
Manhattan (/mænˈhætən, mən-/) is the most densely populated and geographically smallest of the five boroughs of New York City. 　The borough is also coextensive with New York County, one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. 　Located near the southern tip of the State of New York, Manhattan is based in the Eastern Time Zone and constitutes both the geographical and demographic center of the Northeast megalopolis and the urban core of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. 　Over 58 million people live within 250 miles of Manhattan, which serves as New York City’s economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and the city’s historical birthplace. 　Residents of the outer boroughs of New York City often refer to Manhattan as "the city". 　Manhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world, is considered a safe haven for global real estate investors, and hosts the United Nations headquarters. 　Manhattan also serves as the headquarters of the global art market, with numerous art galleries and auction houses collectively hosting half of the world’s art auctions. 　Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, the borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers along with several small adjacent islands, including Roosevelt, U Thant, and Randalls and Wards Islands. 　Manhattan additionally contains the small neighborhood of Marble Hill on the U.S. mainland, which is separated from Manhattan Island by the Harlem Ship Canal and was later connected using landfill to the Bronx. 　Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each cutting across the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. 　Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. 　Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan, and the borough has been the setting for numerous books, films, and television shows. 　Manhattan real estate is among the most expensive in the world, with the value of Manhattan Island, including real estate, estimated to exceed US$3 trillion in 2013; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US$1,600 per square foot ($17,000/m2) as of 2018, with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world, at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) per year in 2017. 　In 2022, the average monthly apartment rent in Manhattan climbed over US$5,000.00 for the first time. 　The area of Manhattan was originally part of Lenape territory. 　European settlement began with the establishment of a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. 　The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. 　New York, based in present-day Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. 　The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th century and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and peace. 　Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898. 　New York County is the smallest county by land area in the contiguous United States, as well as the most densely populated U.S. county. 　Manhattan is one of the most densely populated locations in the world, with a 2020 census population of 1,694,251 living in a land area of 22.83 square miles (59.13 km2), or 72,918 residents per square mile (28,154/km2), higher than the density of any individual U.S. city. 　On business days, the influx of commuters increases this number to over 3.9 million, or more than 170,000 people per square mile (65,600/km2). 　Manhattan has the third-largest population of New York City's five boroughs, after Brooklyn and Queens, and is the smallest borough in terms of land area. 　If each borough were ranked as a city, Manhattan would rank as the sixth-most populous in the U.S. Many districts and landmarks in Manhattan are well known, as New York City received a record 62.8 million tourists in 2017, and Manhattan hosts three of the world's 10 most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal. 　The Empire State Building has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. 　Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere. 　The borough hosts many prominent bridges, including the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensboro, Triborough, and George Washington Bridges; tunnels such as the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels; skyscrapers including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and One World Trade Center; and parks, such as Central Park. 　Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, and Koreatown is replete with karaoke bars. 　The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. 　The City of New York was founded at the southern tip of Manhattan, and the borough houses New York City Hall, the seat of the city's government. 　Numerous colleges and universities are located in Manhattan, including Columbia University, New York University, Cornell Tech, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 40 in the world. 　The Metropolitan Museum of Art is both the largest art museum and the most visited museum in the United States. 　Governors Island in New York Harbor is planned to host a US$1 billion research and education center poised to make New York City the global leader in addressing the climate crisis.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)>Phoenix (mythology)</a> 

<font size=3>
The phoenix is an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology (with analogs in many cultures) that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 　Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. 　Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again. 　In the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, a tool used by folklorists, the phoenix is classified as motif B32. 　The origin of the phoenix has been attributed to Ancient Egypt by Herodotus and later 19th-century scholars, but other scholars think the Egyptian texts may have been influenced by classical folklore. 　Over time the phoenix motif spread and gained a variety of new associations; Herodotus, Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Pope Clement I, Lactantius, Ovid, and Isidore of Seville are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. 　Over time, extending beyond its origins, the phoenix could variously "symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, the Empire, metempsychosis, consecration, resurrection, life in the heavenly Paradise, Christ, Mary, virginity, the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life". 　Some scholars have claimed that the poem De ave phoenice may present the mythological phoenix motif as a symbol of Christ's resurrection.

<font size=3>
In psychology, attitude is a psychological construct that is a mental and emotional entity that inheres or characterizes a person, their attitude to approach to something, or their personal view on it. 　Attitude involves their mindset, outlook and feelings. 　Attitudes are complex and are an acquired state through life experience. 　Attitude is an individual's predisposed state of mind regarding a value and it is precipitated through a responsive expression towards oneself, a person, place, thing, or event (the attitude object) which in turn influences the individual's thought and action. 　Most simply understood attitudes in psychology are the feelings individuals have about themselves and the world. 　Prominent psychologist Gordon Allport described this latent psychological construct as "the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology." 　Attitudes can be formed from a person's past and present. 　Key topics in the study of attitudes include attitude strength, attitude change, consumer behavior, and attitude-behavior relationships.

A telescope is a device used to observe distant objects by their emission, absorption, or reflection of electromagnetic radiation. 　Originally meaning only an optical instrument using lenses, curved mirrors, or a combination of both to observe distant objects, the word telescope now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors. 　The first known practical telescopes were refracting telescopes with glass lenses and were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century. 　They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy. 　The reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope. 　In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 34°S 71°W﻿ / ﻿34°S 71°W﻿ / -34; -71 Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a country located in western South America. 　It is the southernmost country in the world and closest to Antarctica, stretching along a narrow strip of land between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 　With an area of 756,096 square kilometers (291,930 sq mi) and a population of 17.5 million as of 2017, Chile shares borders with Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. 　The country also controls several Pacific islands, including Juan Fernández, Isla Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island, and claims about 1,250,000 square kilometers (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica as the Chilean Antarctic Territory. 　The capital and largest city of Chile is Santiago, and the national language is Spanish. 　Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century, replacing Inca rule, but failed to conquer the independent Mapuche people who inhabited what is now south-central Chile. 　In 1818, after declaring independence from Spain, Chile emerged as a relatively stable authoritarian republic in the 1830s. 　During the 19th century, Chile experienced significant economic and territorial growth, putting an end to Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific (1879–83) by defeating Peru and Bolivia. 　In the 20th century, up until the 1970s, Chile underwent a process of democratization and experienced rapid population growth and urbanization, while relying increasingly on exports from copper mining to support its economy. 　During the 1960s and 1970s, the country was marked by severe left-right political polarization and turmoil, which culminated in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically elected left-wing government. 　This was followed by a 16-year right-wing military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths or disappearances. 　The regime ended in 1990, following a referendum in 1988, and was succeeded by a center-left coalition, which ruled until 2010. 　Chile is a developing country with a high-income economy and ranks 42nd in the Human Development Index. 　It is one of the most economically and socially stable nations in South America, and leads Latin America in competitiveness, per capita income, globalization, peace, and economic freedom. 　Chile also performs well in the region in terms of sustainability of the state and democratic development, and boasts the lowest homicide rate in the Americas, following only Canada. 　Chile is a founding member of the United Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Pacific Alliance, and joined the OECD in 2010.

<font size=3>
Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. 　Hydrogen is the lightest element. 　At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. 　It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. 　Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. 　Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. 　Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. 　For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. 　In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. 　The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. 　Hydrogen is nonmetallic (except it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds. 　Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. 　In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. 　The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. 　Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics. 　Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. 　In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former". 　Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. 　A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. 　Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. 　It can be burned to produce heat or combined with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly, with water being the only emissions at the point of usage. 　Hydrogen atoms (but not gaseous molecules) are problematic in metallurgy because they can embrittle many metals.

<font size=3>
A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper class country house. 　Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably. 　After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. 　Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages into elegant upper-class country homes. 　In the Early Modern period, any comfortable detached house with a garden near a city or town was likely to be described as a villa; most survivals have now been engulfed by suburbia. 　In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to, in some countries, especially around the Mediterranean, residences of above average size in the countryside.

Biology is the scientific study of life. 　It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. 　For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. 　Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. 　Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. 　Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments. 　Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. 　Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. 　Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them. 　Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago, is immensely diverse. 　Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. 　These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar>Radar</a> 

<font size=3>
Radar is a radiolocation system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle (azimuth), and radial velocity of objects relative to the site. 　It is used to detect and track aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, and motor vehicles, and map weather formations, and terrain. 　A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects. 　Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the objects and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects' locations and speeds. 　Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II. 　A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. 　The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for radio detection and ranging. 　The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. 　The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, anti-missile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations. 　Modern high tech radar systems use digital signal processing and machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels. 　Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　One example is lidar, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves. 　With the emergence of driver-less vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration>Immigration</a> 

<font size=3>
Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle as permanent residents or naturalized citizens. 　Commuters, tourists, and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration; seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included, however. 　As for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. 　Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. 　Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent for the scenarios in which 37 to 53 percent of the developing countries' workers migrate to the developed countries. 　Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction. 　Positive net immigration can soften the demographic dilemma in the aging global North. 　The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. 　Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants. 　Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics in the United States and Europe.

<font size=3>
Yorkshire (/ˈjɔːrkʃər, -ʃɪər/ YORK-shər, -⁠shihər; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county in northern England and the largest by area size in the United Kingdom. 　Because of its large area in comparison with other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. 　Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographic territory and cultural region. 　The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. 　Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are large stretches of countryside, including the Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors and Peak District national parks. 　Yorkshire has been nicknamed "God's Own Country" by its people. 　The emblem of Yorkshire is the White Rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the white rose on a blue field which, after nearly fifty years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. 　Yorkshire Day, held annually on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its dialect. 　Yorkshire is covered by different Government Office Regions. 　Most of the county falls within Yorkshire and the Humber while the extreme northern part of the county, such as Middlesbrough, Redcar, Holwick and Startforth, falls within North East England. 　Small areas in the west of the county are covered by the North West England region.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir>Choir</a> 

<font size=3>
A choir (/ˈkwaɪər/ KWIRE; also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. 　Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. 　Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. 　Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures. 　The term choir is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the quire), whereas a chorus performs in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is not rigid. 　Choirs may sing without instruments, or accompanied by a piano, pipe organ, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. 　A choir can be a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the "woodwind choir" of an orchestra, or different "choirs" of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition. 　In typical 18th century to 21st century oratorios and masses, 'chorus' or 'choir' implies that there is more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream>Cream</a> 

<font size=3>
Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. 　In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. 　In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". 　In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. 　It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat. 　Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. 　Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy". 　In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. 　Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. 　Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. 　Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow color. 　Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

<font size=3>
Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. 　A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. 　Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers. 　Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. 　Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. 　Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era. 　In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. 　Digital technologies are also affecting the way that consumers pay for goods and services. 　Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services. 　Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services, and the store's overall market positioning. 　Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel, and presentation.

In political and sociological theory, the elite (French: élite, from Latin: eligere, to select or to sort out) are a small group of powerful people who hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, privilege, political power, or skill in a group. 　Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the "elite" are "those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type." 　American sociologist C. Wright Mills states that members of the elite accept their fellows' position of importance in society. 　"As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'." 　It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey>Honey</a> 

<font size=3>
Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several bees, the best-known of which are honey bees. 　Honey is made and stored to nourish bee colonies. 　Bees produce honey by gathering and then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. 　This refinement takes place both within individual bees, through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, as well as during storage in the hive, through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until it is thick and viscous. 　Honey bees stockpile honey in the hive. 　Within the hive is a structure made from wax called honeycomb. 　The honeycomb is made up of hundreds or thousands of hexagonal cells, into which the bees regurgitate honey for storage. 　Other honey-producing species of bee store the substance in different structures, such as the pots made of wax and resin used by the stingless bee. 　Honey for human consumption is collected from wild bee colonies, or from the hives of domesticated bees. 　The honey produced by honey bees is the most familiar to humans, thanks to its worldwide commercial production and availability. 　The husbandry of bees is known as beekeeping or apiculture, with the cultivation of stingless bees usually referred to as meliponiculture. 　Honey is sweet because of its high concentrations of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose. 　It has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar). 　One standard tablespoon (15 mL) of honey provides around 190 kilojoules (46 kilocalories) of food energy. 　It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. 　Most microorganisms cannot grow in honey and sealed honey therefore does not spoil. 　Samples of honey discovered in archaeological contexts have proven edible even after thousands of years. 　Honey use and production has a long and varied history, with its beginnings in prehistoric times. 　Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. 　While Apis melifera is an Old World insect, large-scale meliponiculture of New World stingless bees has been practiced by Mayans since pre-Columbian times.

<font size=3>
In astrology, reception is a condition where one planet is located in a sign where a second planet has astrological dignity--for example, a sign which the second planet rules or in which it is exalted, or where the second planet is the triplicity ruler. 　In such a case, the first planet is said to be "received" by the dignified planet, and this relationship was seen by ancient and medieval astrologers to function in a similar way to that of host and guest. 　The dignified planet is strong, and hence provides support and assistance to the second planet which falls within its purview. 　Consider the Sun in Libra. 　Venus is said to 'receive' the Sun because he is visiting her sign. 　In this capacity Venus is known as the Sun's dispositor. 　— Deborah Houlding, Sometimes this relationship is mutual—that is, each planet is in each other's sign of dignity. 　This condition is called mutual reception or "exchange of signs" and can be very beneficial to both planets.

Christians (/ˈkrɪstʃən, -tiən/ (listen)) are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. 　The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ) (usually rendered as messiah in English). 　While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict, they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance. 　The term Christian used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." 　It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'. 　According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910. 　Today, about 37% of all Christians live in the Americas, about 26% live in Europe, 24% live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 13% live in Asia and the Pacific, and 1% live in the Middle East and North Africa. 　Christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. 　280 million Christians live as a minority. 　About half of all Christians worldwide are Catholic, while more than a third are Protestant (37%). 　Orthodox communions comprise 12% of the world's Christians. 　Other Christian groups make up the remainder. 　By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. 　According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, Christianity will remain the world's largest religion in 2050, if current trends continue. 　In recent history, Christians have experienced persecution of varying severity, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.
