Ontario (/ɒnˈtɛərioʊ/ (listen) on-TAIR-ee-oh; French: [ɔ̃taʁjo]) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. 　Located in Central Canada, it is Canada's most populous province, with 38.3 percent of the country's population, and is the second-largest province by total area (after Quebec). 　Ontario is Canada's fourth-largest jurisdiction in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. 　It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto, which is Ontario's provincial capital. 　Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast, and to the south by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. 　Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. 　There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of actual land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border. 　The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is in Southern Ontario. 　In contrast, Northern Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation.

<font size=3>
An ear is the organ that enables hearing and, in mammals, body balance using the vestibular system. 　In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. 　The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. 　Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word "ear" often refers to the external part alone. 　The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. 　The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. 　The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localization. 　The ear develops from the first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from ectoderm. 　The ear may be affected by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. 　Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear. 　The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewelry in numerous cultures for thousands of years, and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations.

<font size=3>
Look up emergency in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　An emergency is an urgent, unexpected, and usually dangerous situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment and requires immediate action. 　Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath. 　While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency. 　The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

<font size=3>
In folklore, giants (from Ancient Greek: gigas, cognate giga-) are beings of human-like appearance, but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance. 　The word giant is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester's chronicle. 　It is derived from the Gigantes (Greek: Γίγαντες) of Greek mythology. 　Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted ogres, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. 　The antagonist in Jack and the Beanstalk is often described as a giant. 　In some more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen>Stephen</a> 
<font size=3>
Stephen or Steven is a common English first name. 　It is particularly significant to Christians, as it belonged to Saint Stephen (Greek: Στέφανος Stéphanos), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts, was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or "protomartyr") of the Christian Church. 　In English, Stephen is most commonly pronounced as STEEV-ən (/ˈstiːvən/). 　The name, in both the forms Stephen and Steven, is often shortened to Steve or Stevie. 　The spelling as Stephen can also be pronounced /ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən which is from the Greek original version, Stephanos. 　In English, the female version of the name is Stephanie. 　Many surnames are derived from the first name, including Stephens, Stevens, Stephenson, and Stevenson, all of which mean "Stephen's (son)". 　In modern times the name has sometimes been given with intentionally non-standard spelling, such as Stevan or Stevon. 　A common variant of the name used in English is Stephan /ˈstɛfən/; related names that have found some currency or significance in English include Stefan (pronounced /ˈstɛfən/ or /stəˈfɑːn/ in English), Esteban (often pronounced /ˈɛstɪˌbæn/), and the Shakespearean Stephano (/ˈstɛfənoʊ/).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult>Adult</a> 
<font size=3>
An adult is a human or other animal that has reached full growth. 　In human context, the term adult has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. 　In contrast to a "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. 　They may also be regarded as a "major". 　The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights, country, and psychological development. 　Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. 　Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior, but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. 　Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character. 　In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. 　This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. 　Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.

<font size=3>
The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland [ˈneːdərlɑnt] (listen)), informally Holland, is a country located in Northwestern Europe with overseas territories in the Caribbean. 　It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 　The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. 　It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium in the North Sea. 　The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. 　Dutch, English and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories. 　The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. 　Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital. 　The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. 　The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe. 　Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. 　The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. 　It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague. 　Netherlands literally means "lower countries" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with nearly 26% falling below sea level. 　Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. 　In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. 　During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world. 　With a population of 17.7 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 520 people per square kilometre (1,300 people/sq mi). 　Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness. 　The Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. 　The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. 　The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. 　Its mixed-market advanced economy has the thirteenth-highest per capita income globally. 　The Netherlands ranks among the highest in international indices of press freedom, economic freedom, human development and quality of life, as well as happiness.

<font size=3>
A coupling is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power. 　The primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. 　In a more general context, a coupling can also be a mechanical device that serves to connect the ends of adjacent parts or objects. 　Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are torque-limiting couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded. 　Selection, installation and maintenance of couplings can lead to reduced maintenance time and maintenance cost.

<font size=3>
Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 　Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. 　There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. 　Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. 　Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. 　The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. 　Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. 　Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. 　Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. 　Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. 　According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs. 　Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. 　Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. 　The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. 　Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). 　Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. 　They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. 　Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. 　Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. 　Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. 　Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. 　Birds figure throughout human culture. 　About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. 　Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. 　Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

A factory, manufacturing plant or a production plant is an industrial facility, often a complex consisting of several buildings filled with machinery, where workers manufacture items or operate machines which process each item into another. 　They are a critical part of modern economic production, with the majority of the world's goods being created or processed within factories. 　Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution, when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops. 　Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules, and fewer than a dozen workers have been called "glorified workshops". 　Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. 　Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. 　In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a "Shed". 　Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. 　Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants and may have most of their equipment – tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping – outdoors and operated from control rooms. 　Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors. 　Discrete products may be final goods, or parts and sub-assemblies which are made into final products elsewhere. 　Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials. 　Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity to transform streams of raw materials into finished products. 　The term mill originally referred to the milling of grain, which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century. 　Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing were originally powered by water, the term survives as in steel mill, paper mill, etc.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy>Galaxy</a> 
<font size=3>
A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity. 　The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. 　Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. 　Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. 　Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. 　Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. 　Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. 　The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. 　As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed. 　It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. 　In 2016, using 20 years of images from the Hubble space telescope, it was estimated that there were in total two trillion (2×1012) or more galaxies in the observable universe, and as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars (more stars than all the grains of sand on all beaches of the planet Earth). 　In 2021, data from NASA's New Horizons space probe was used to revise the earlier estimate to roughly 200 billion galaxies (2×1011), Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). 　For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy (with diameter of about 152,000 ly), its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.) The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. 　Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. 　The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy. 　The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. 　At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids. 　Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow>Snow</a> 
<font size=3>
Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. 　It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. 　Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. 　Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. 　Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. 　As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. 　Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. 　Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. 　Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. 　Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica. 　Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. 　Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.

<font size=3>
Symmetry (from Ancient Greek: συμμετρία symmetria "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement") in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance. 　In mathematics, "symmetry" has a more precise definition, and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations; including translation, reflection, rotation or scaling. 　Although these two meanings of "symmetry" can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article. 　Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, including theoretic models, language, and music. 　This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in mathematics, including geometry, the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in science and nature; and in the arts, covering architecture, art and music. 　The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry, which refers to the absence or a violation of symmetry.

<font size=3>
A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of a non-rigid container. 　The use of bags predates recorded history, with the earliest bags being lengths of animal skin, cotton, or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material. 　Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the development of human civilization, as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such as berries or food grains, and to transport more items than could readily be carried in the hands. 　The word probably has its origins in the Norse word baggi, from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European bʰak, but is also comparable to the Welsh baich (load, bundle), and the Greek Τσιαντουλίτσα (Chandulícha, load). 　Cheap disposable paper bags and plastic shopping bags are very common varying in size and strength in the retail trade as a convenience for shoppers, and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small fee. 　Customers may also take their own shopping bags to use in shops, these are more commonly known as tote bags or shoppers tote. 　Although, paper had been used for purposes of wrapping and padding in ancient China since the 2nd century BC, the first use of paper bags (for preserving the flavor of tea) in China came during the later Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD).

Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 　They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). 　Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. 　Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. 　Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. 　The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. 　The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. 　The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.
