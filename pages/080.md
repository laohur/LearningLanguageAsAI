<font size=3>
The term yield is used to describe the volume of water escaping from a spring over a certain period of time, the discharge quantity of which is measured in [l/s]. 　Measurement methods include volume–filling-time measurement and water level measurement. 　The discharge of a spring can fluctuate to a greater or lesser extent depending on precipitation and evaporation. 　Karst springs show particularly large time-dependent differences in the discharge.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver>Vancouver</a> 
<font size=3>
Vancouver (/vænˈkuːvər/ (listen) van-KOO-vər) is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. 　As the most populous city in the province, the 2021 Canadian census recorded 662,248 people in the city, up from 631,486 in 2016. 　The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2.6 million in 2021, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. 　Greater Vancouver, along with the Fraser Valley, comprises the Lower Mainland with a regional population of over 3 million. 　Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with over 5,700 people per square kilometre, and fourth highest in North America (after New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City). 　Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 49.3 percent of its residents are not native English speakers, 47.8 percent are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 54.5 percent of residents belong to visible minority groups. 　It has been consistently ranked one of the most livable cities in Canada and in the world. 　In terms of housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the most expensive cities in Canada and in the world. 　Vancouver plans to become the greenest city in the world. 　Vancouverism is the city's urban planning design philosophy. 　Indigenous settlement of Vancouver began more than 10,000 years ago, and included the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples. 　The beginnings of the modern city, which was originally named Gastown, grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings Mill that was built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor Gassy Jack. 　The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. 　Gastown then formally registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. 　The city was renamed "Vancouver" in 1886, through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway. 　The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. 　The city's large natural seaport on the Pacific Ocean became a vital link in the trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada. 　Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several matches of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup including the finals at BC Place in Downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city. 　In 1969, Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver. 　The city became the permanent home to TED conferences in 2014. 　As of 2016[update], the Port of Vancouver is the fourth-largest port by tonnage in the Americas, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. 　While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. 　Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the nickname "Hollywood North".

<font size=3>
A physician (American English), medical practitioner (Commonwealth English), medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a health professional who practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. 　Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. 　Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine. 　Both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. 　Degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration, compassion, and benevolence for their patients.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear>Gear</a> 
<font size=3>
A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another (compatible) toothed part to transmit (convert) torque and speed. 　The basic principle behind the operation of gears is analogous to the basic principle of levers. 　A gear may also be known informally as a cog. 　Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. 　Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. 　The rotational speeds, and the torques, of two meshing gears differ in proportion to their diameters. 　The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape. 　Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a gear train or a transmission. 　The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed, belt pulley system. 　An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage. 　In transmissions with multiple gear ratios—such as bicycles, motorcycles, and cars—the term "gear" (e.g., "first gear") refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear. 　The term describes similar devices, even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete, or when the device does not actually contain gears, as in a continuously variable transmission (CVT). 　Sometimes a CVT is referred to as an "infinitely variable transmission". 　Furthermore, a gear can mesh with a linear toothed part, called a rack, producing movement in a straight line instead of rotation (movement in a circle). 　See Rack and Pinion for an example.

<font size=3>
Absorption is a disposition or personality trait in which a person becomes absorbed in their mental imagery, particularly fantasy. 　This trait thus correlates highly with a fantasy prone personality. 　The original research on absorption was by American psychologist Auke Tellegen. 　The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. 　Absorption has a variable correlation with hypnotisability (r = 0.13–0.89) perhaps because in addition to broad personality dispositions, situational factors play an important role in performance on tests of hypnotic susceptibility. 　Absorption is one of the traits assessed in the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire.

Absorption is the journey of a drug travelling from the site of administration to the site of action. 　The drug travels by some route of administration (oral, topical-dermal, etc.) in a chosen dosage form (e.g., tablets, capsules, or in solution). 　Absorption by some other routes, such as intravenous therapy, intramuscular injection, enteral nutrition, is even more straightforward and there is less variability in absorption and bioavailability is often near 100%. 　Intravascular administration does not involve absorption, and there is no loss of drug. 　The fastest route of absorption is inhalation. 　Absorption is a primary focus in drug development and medicinal chemistry, since a drug must be absorbed before any medicinal effects can take place. 　Moreover, the drug's pharmacokinetic profile can be easily and significantly changed by adjusting factors that affect absorption.

A première, also spelled premiere, is the debut (first public presentation) of a play, film, dance, or musical composition. 　A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world), its first presentation in each country, and an online première (the first time it is published on the Internet). 　When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play The Maids by the French dramatist Jean Genet received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. 　Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain.

<font size=3>
Maine (/meɪn/ (listen)) is the easternmost state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. 　It borders New Hampshire to the west, the Gulf of Maine to the southeast, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and northwest, respectively. 　The largest state by total area in New England, Maine is the 12th-smallest by area, the 9th-least populous, the 13th-least densely populated, and the most rural of the 50 U.S. states. 　It is also the northeasternmost among the contiguous United States, the northernmost state east of the Great Lakes, the only state whose name consists of a single syllable, and the only state to border exactly one other U.S. state. 　Approximately half the area of Maine lies on each side of the 45th parallel north in latitude. 　The most populous city in Maine is Portland, while its capital is Augusta. 　Maine has traditionally been known for its jagged, rocky Atlantic Ocean and bayshore coastlines; smoothly contoured mountains; heavily forested interior; picturesque waterways; and its wild lowbush blueberries and seafood cuisine, especially lobster and clams. 　Coastal and Down East Maine have emerged as important centers for the creative economy, especially in the vicinity of Portland, which is also bringing gentrification. 　The territory of Maine has been inhabited by aboriginal populations for thousands of years after the glaciers retreated during the last ice age. 　At the time of European arrival, several Algonquian-speaking nations governed the area and these nations are now known as the Wabanaki Confederacy. 　The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island, founded by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons. 　The first English settlement was the short-lived Popham Colony, established by the Plymouth Company in 1607. 　A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate and conflict with the local Indigenous people caused many to fail. 　As Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. 　Loyalist and Patriot forces contended for Maine's territory during the American Revolution. 　During the War of 1812, the largely undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces with the goal of annexing it to Canada via the Colony of New Ireland, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a peace treaty that restored the pre-war boundaries. 　Maine was part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. 　On March 15, 1820, under the Missouri Compromise, it was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke>Stroke</a> 
<font size=3>
A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. 　There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. 　Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. 　Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. 　Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. 　If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. 　A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. 　The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. 　Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control. 　The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. 　Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. 　An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. 　A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. 　Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. 　Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. 　A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. 　Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. 　Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. 　Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. 　Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. 　A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. 　An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. 　Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. 　Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world. 　In 2013, approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. 　In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. 　Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. 　In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). 　About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. 　About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. 　Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.

<font size=3>
A ferry is a ship, watercraft or amphibious vehicle used to carry passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo, across a body of water. 　A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, Italy, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi. 　Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. 　Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services, and many carry vehicles.

<font size=3>
In grammar, a phrase—called expression in some contexts—is a group of words or singular word acting as a grammatical unit. 　For instance, the English expression "the very happy squirrel" is a noun phrase which contains the adjective phrase "very happy". 　Phrases can consist of a single word or a complete sentence. 　In theoretical linguistics, phrases are often analyzed as units of syntactic structure such as a constituent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying>Crying</a> 
<font size=3>
Crying is the dropping of tears (or welling of tears in the eyes) in response to an emotional state, or pain. 　Emotions that can lead to crying include sadness, anger, and even happiness. 　The act of crying has been defined as "a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures", instead, giving a relief which protects from conjunctivitis. 　A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. 　Various forms of crying are known as sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering. 　For crying to be described as sobbing, it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms, such as slow but erratic inhalation, occasional instances of breath holding and muscular tremor. 　A neuronal connection between the lacrimal gland and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established.　[citation needed] Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. 　They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and Leu-enkephalin, and the elements potassium and manganese.

Coordinates: 35°N 38°E﻿ / ﻿35°N 38°E﻿ / 35; 38 Syria (Arabic: سُورِيَا or سُورِيَة, romanized: Sūriyā), officially the Syrian Arab Republic (Arabic: الجمهورية العربية السورية, romanized: al-Jumhūrīyah al-ʻArabīyah as-Sūrīyah), is a Western Asian country located in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant. 　It is a unitary republic that consists of 14 governorates (subdivisions), and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east and southeast, Jordan to the south, and Israel and Lebanon to the southwest. 　Cyprus lies to the west across the Mediterranean Sea. 　A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including the majority Syrian Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Armenians, Circassians, Albanians, and Greeks. 　Religious groups include Muslims, Christians, Alawites, Druze, and Yazidis. 　The capital and largest city of Syria is Damascus. 　Arabs are the largest ethnic group, and Muslims are the largest religious group. 　Syria is the only country that is governed by Ba'athism, an ideology that advocates Arab socialism and Arab nationalism. 　The name "Syria" historically referred to a wider region, broadly synonymous with the Levant, and known in Arabic as al-Sham. 　The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC. 　Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. 　In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. 　The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman rule. 　After a period as a French mandate (1923–1946), the newly created state represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces. 　It gained de jure independence as a democratic parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945 when the Republic of Syria became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate (although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946). 　The post-independence period was tumultuous, with multiple military coups and coup attempts shaking the country between 1949 and 1971. 　In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the United Arab Republic, which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. 　The republic was renamed as the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after the December 1 constitutional referendum of that year. 　A significant event was the 1963 coup d'état carried out by the military committee of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party which established a one-party state. 　Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending the constitutional protections for citizens. 　Internal power-struggles within neo-Ba'athist factions caused further coups in 1966 and 1970, which eventually resulted in the seizure of power by General Hafez al-Assad. 　Assad assigned Alawite loyalists to key posts in the armed forces, bureaucracy, Mukhabarat and the ruling elite; effectively establishing an "Alawi minority rule" to consolidate power within his family. 　After the death of Hafez al-Assad in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad inherited the presidency and political system centred around a cult of personality to al-Assad family. 　The Ba'ath regime has been condemned for numerous human rights abuses, including frequent executions of citizens and political prisoners, massive censorship and for financing a multi-billion dollar illicit drug trade. 　Syria is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement. 　Following its violent suppression of Arab Spring protests of the 2011 Syrian Revolution, the Syrian government was suspended from the Arab League in November 2011 and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean in December 2011. 　Since July 2011, Syria has been embroiled in a multi-sided civil war, with the involvement of different countries. 　The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria in August 2012 citing "deep concern at the massacres and inhuman acts" perpetrated by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad. 　As of 2020, three political entities – the Syrian Interim Government, Syrian Salvation Government and Rojava – have emerged in Syrian territory to challenge Assad's rule. 　Syria was ranked last on the Global Peace Index from 2016 to 2018, making it the most violent country in the world due to the war. 　Syria is the most corrupt country in the MENA region and was ranked the second lowest ("second to the worst") globally on the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index. 　The Syrian civil war has killed more than 570,000 people, with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of the total civilian casualties. 　The war led to the Syrian refugee crisis, with an estimated 7.6 million internally displaced people (July 2015 UNHCR figure) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by UNHCR), making population assessment difficult in recent years. 　The war has also worsened economic conditions, with more than 90% of population living under poverty and 80% of Syrians face food insecurity.

<font size=3>
Discrimination is the act of making unjustified, prejudiced distinctions between people based on the groups, classes, or other categories to which they belong or are perceived to belong. 　People may be discriminated on the basis of race, gender, age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation, as well as other categories. 　Discrimination especially occurs when individuals or groups are unfairly treated in a way which is worse than other people are treated, on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories. 　It involves restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group. 　Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. 　In some places, attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. 　These attempts have often been met with controversy, and have sometimes been called reverse discrimination.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity>Trinity</a> 
<font size=3>
The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus 'threefold') is the central doctrine concerning the nature of God in most Christian churches, which defines one God existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons sharing one homoousion (essence) "each is God, complete and whole." 　As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. 　In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is. 　This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. 　Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes "from the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Holy Spirit." 　This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called Trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. 　Christian nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism. 　While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. 　The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians and fathers of the Church as they attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions. 　Though the Trinity is mainly a Christian concept, Judaism has had parallel views, especially among writings from the kabbalah tradition.
