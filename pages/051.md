<font size=3>
Earl (/ɜːrl, ɜːrəl/) is a rank of the nobility in the United Kingdom. 　The title originates in the Old English word eorl, meaning "a man of noble birth or rank". 　The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant "chieftain", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. 　After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer). 　Alternative names for the rank equivalent to "earl" or "count" in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the hakushaku (伯爵) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era. 　In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount. 　A feminine form of earl never developed; instead, countess is used.

<font size=3>
In geography, a plain, commonly known as flatland, is a flat expanse of land that generally does not change much in elevation, and is primarily treeless. 　Plains occur as lowlands along valleys or at the base of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands. 　Plains are one of the major landforms on earth, being present on all continents and covering more than one-third of the world's land area. 　Plains in many areas are important for agriculture. 　There are various types of plains and biomes on them.

<font size=3>
A shed is typically a simple, single-story roofed structure that is used for hobbies, or as a workshop in a back garden or on an allotment. 　Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and electrical outlets. 　Sheds used on farms or in the industry can be large structures. 　The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. 　Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. 　Sheds may be lockable to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc.

Indiana (/ˌɪndiˈænə/ (listen)) is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States. 　It is the 38th-largest by area and the 17th-most populous of the 50 States. 　Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis. 　Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th state on December 11, 1816. 　It is bordered by Lake Michigan to the northwest, Michigan to the north and northeast, Ohio to the east, the Ohio River and Kentucky to the south and southeast, and the Wabash River and Illinois to the west. 　Various indigenous peoples inhabited what would become Indiana for thousands of years, some of whom the U.S. government expelled between 1800 and 1836. 　Indiana received its name because the state was largely possessed by native tribes even after it was granted statehood. 　Since then, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Upland South, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee. 　Indiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of $352.62 billion in 2021. 　It has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller cities and towns. 　Indiana is home to professional sports teams, including the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and the NBA's Indiana Pacers. 　The state also hosts several notable competitive events, such as the Indianapolis 500, held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension>Dimension</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. 　Thus, a line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it – for example, the point at 5 on a number line. 　A surface, such as the boundary of a cylinder or sphere, has a dimension of two (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it – for example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. 　A two-dimensional Euclidean space is a two-dimensional space on the plane. 　The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. 　In classical mechanics, space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time. 　That conception of the world is a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. 　The four dimensions (4D) of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. 　Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. 　10 dimensions are used to describe superstring theory (6D hyperspace + 4D), 11 dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory (7D hyperspace + 4D), and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space. 　The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. 　High-dimensional spaces frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. 　They may be Euclidean spaces or more general parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space in which we live.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity>Gravity</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics, gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight') is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. 　Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. 　As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. 　However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 　On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans (the corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the Earth and Moon orbiting one another). 　Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms. 　Investigation into the effects of weightlessness has shown that gravity may play a role in immune system function and cell differentiation within the human body. 　The gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the universe allowed it to coalesce and form stars which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. 　Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away. 　Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. 　The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon. 　However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: F = G m 1 m 2 r 2 , {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}},} where F is the force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting, r is the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. 　Current models of particle physics imply that the earliest instance of gravity in the universe, possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or a gravitational singularity, along with ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck epoch (up to 10−43 seconds after the birth of the universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle, in a currently unknown manner. 　Scientists are currently working to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a theory of everything) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation>Radiation</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. 　This includes: electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ) particle radiation, such as alpha radiation (α), beta radiation (β), proton radiation and neutron radiation (particles of non-zero rest energy) acoustic radiation, such as ultrasound, sound, and seismic waves (dependent on a physical transmission medium) gravitational radiation, that takes the form of gravitational waves, or ripples in the curvature of spacetime Radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or non-ionizing depending on the energy of the radiated particles. 　Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 eV, which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds. 　This is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms. 　A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit α, β, or γ radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons, respectively. 　Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere. 　Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 　The word "ionize" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. 　Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. 　The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. 　Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. 　These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies. 　The word "radiation" arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. 　This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. 　Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. 　Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.

Coordinates: 47°20′N 13°20′E﻿ / ﻿47.333°N 13.333°E﻿ / 47.333; 13.333 Austria, formally the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in the southern part of Central Europe, lying in the Eastern Alps. 　It is a federation of nine states, one of which is the capital, Vienna, the most populous city and state. 　A landlocked country, Austria is bordered by Germany to the northwest, the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia to the northeast, Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. 　The country occupies an area of 83,871 km2 (32,383 sq mi) and has a population of 9 million. 　Austria emerged from the remnants of the Eastern and Hungarian March at the end of the first millennium. 　Originally a margraviate of Bavaria, it developed into a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in 1156 and was later made an archduchy in 1453. 　In the 16th century, Vienna began serving as the empire's administrative capital and Austria thus became the heartland of the Habsburg monarchy. 　After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Austria established its own empire, which became a great power and the dominant member of the German Confederation. 　The empire's defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 led to the end of the Confederation and paved the way for the establishment of Austria-Hungary a year later. 　After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, Emperor Franz Joseph declared war on Serbia, which ultimately escalated into World War I. 　The empire's defeat and subsequent collapse led to the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918 and the First Austrian Republic in 1919. 　During the interwar period, anti-parliamentarian sentiments culminated in the formation of an Austrofascist dictatorship under Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934. 　A year before the outbreak of World War II, Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany by Adolf Hitler, and it became a sub-national division. 　After its liberation in 1945 and a decade of Allied occupation, the country regained its sovereignty and declared its perpetual neutrality in 1955. 　Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy with a popularly elected president as head of state and a chancellor as head of government and chief executive. 　Major cities include Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. 　Austria is consistently listed as one of the richest countries in the world by GDP per capita and one of the countries with the highest standard of living; it was ranked 25th in the world for its Human Development Index in 2021. 　Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 and of the European Union since 1995. 　It hosts the OSCE and OPEC and is a founding member of the OECD and Interpol. 　It also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995, and adopted the euro currency in 1999.

<font size=3>
A satellite or artificial satellite is an object intentionally placed into orbit in outer space. 　Satellites have a variety of uses, including communication relay, weather forecasting, navigation (GPS), broadcasting, scientific research, and Earth observation. 　Additional military uses are reconnaissance, early warning, signals intelligence and, potentially, weapon delivery. 　Other satellites include the final rocket stages that placed satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that are now defunct. 　Except for passive satellites, most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board, such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). 　Most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations, called transponders. 　Many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work, the most popular of which is small CubeSats. 　Similar satellites can work together as a group, forming constellations. 　Because of the high launch cost to space, satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. 　Most communication satellites are radio relay stations in orbit and carry dozens of transponders, each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz. 　Satellites are placed from the surface to orbit by launch vehicles, high enough to avoid orbital decay by the atmosphere. 　Satellites can then change or maintain the orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or ion thrusters. 　In 2018, about 90% of satellites orbiting Earth are in low Earth orbit or geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still at the sky. 　Some imaging satellites chose a Sun-synchronous orbit because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting. 　As the number of satellites and space debris around Earth increases, the threat of collision has become more severe. 　A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as the Moon, Mars, and the Sun) or many bodies at once (two for a halo orbit, three for a Lissajous orbit). 　Earth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring the weather, ocean, forest, etc. 　Space telescopes take advantage of outer space's near perfect vacuum to observe objects with the entire electromagnetic spectrum. 　Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once, communications satellites can relay information to remote places. 　The signal delay from satellites and their orbit's predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. 　Space probes are satellites designed for robotic space exploration outside of Earth, and space stations are in essence crewed satellites. 　The first artificial satellite to be launched into the Earth's orbit was the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957.

<font size=3>
A satellite is a subviral agent that depends on the coinfection of a host cell with a helper virus for its replication. 　Satellites can be divided into two major classes: satellite viruses and satellite nucleic acids. 　Satellite viruses, which are most commonly associated with plants, are also found in mammals, arthropods, and bacteria. 　They encode structural proteins to enclose their genetic material, which are therefore distinct from the structural proteins of their helper viruses. 　Satellite nucleic acids, in contrast, do not encode their own structural proteins, but instead are encapsulated by proteins encoded by their helper viruses. 　The genomes of satellites range upward from 359 nucleotides in length for satellite tobacco ringspot virus RNA (STobRV). 　Most viruses have the capability to use host enzymes or their own replication machinery to independently replicate their own viral RNA. 　Satellites, in contrast, are completely dependent on a helper virus for replication. 　The symbiotic relationship between a satellite and a helper virus to catalyze the replication of a satellite genome is also dependent on the host to provide components like replicases to carry out replication. 　A satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage. 　However, the usage of this term remains controversial due to the lack of fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses.

Heaven, or the heavens, is a common religious cosmological or transcendent supernatural place where beings such as deities, angels, souls, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or reside. 　According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife or, in exceptional cases, enter Heaven alive. 　Heaven is often described as a "highest place", the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the "low places" and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply divine will. 　Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come. 　Another belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world, and the underworld. 　In Indian religions, heaven is considered as Svarga loka, and the soul is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its karma. 　This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves Moksha or Nirvana. 　Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as the otherworld. 　At least in the Abrahamic faiths of Christianity, Islam, and some schools of Judaism, as well as Zoroastrianism, heaven is the realm of Afterlife where good actions in the previous life are rewarded for eternity (hell being the place where bad behavior is punished).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairs>Stairs</a> 
<font size=3>
Stairs are a structure designed to bridge a large vertical distance between lower and higher levels by dividing it into smaller vertical distances. 　This is achieved as a diagonal series of horizontal platforms called steps which enable passage to the other level by stepping from one to another step in turn. 　Steps are very typically rectangular. 　Stairs may be straight, round, or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles. 　Types of stairs include staircases (also called stairways), ladders, and escalators. 　Some alternatives to stairs are elevators (also called lifts), stairlifts, inclined moving walkways, and ramps. 　A stairwell is a vertical shaft or opening that contains a staircase. 　A flight (of stairs) is an inclined part of a staircase consisting of steps (and their lateral supports if supports are separate from steps).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating>Dating</a> 
<font size=3>
Dating is a stage of romantic relationships in which two individuals engage in an activity together, most often with the intention of evaluating each other's suitability as a partner in a future intimate relationship. 　It falls into the category of courtship, consisting of social events carried out by the couple either alone or with others. 　The protocols and practices of dating and the terms used to describe it vary vastly between cultures, societies, and time periods. 　Although dating is most often colloquially used to refer to the action of individuals engaging in dates with one other, dating can also encompass a wide range of activities which fall outside participation in social events. 　The meaning of dating also shifted during the 20th century to include a more informal use referring to a romantic, sexual relationship itself beyond an introductory or trial stage. 　Although informal, this meaning is very common and is used in formal speech as well as writing. 　Although taboo across most of the world for much of history, premarital sex has become increasingly common within the last century, beginning with the onset of the sexual revolution. 　Across a greater number of portrayals in film, television, and music, sex within dating has become increasingly accepted as a natural progression of the relationship.

Arizona (/ˌærɪˈzoʊnə/ (listen) ARR-ih-ZOH-nə; Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo [hoː˥z̥to˩ ha˩hoː˩tso˩]; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak [ˈaɭi̥ ˈʂɔnak]) is a state in the Southwestern United States. 　It is the 6th-largest and the 14th-most-populous of the 50 states. 　Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. 　Arizona is part of the Four Corners region with Utah to the north, Colorado to the northeast, and New Mexico to the east; its other neighboring states are Nevada to the northwest, California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest. 　Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. 　Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. 　After being defeated in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. 　The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase. 　Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. 　Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. 　There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Alpine, and Tucson. 　In addition to the internationally known Grand Canyon National Park, which is one of the world's seven natural wonders, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments. 　Arizona's population and economy have grown dramatically since the 1950s because of inward migration, and the state is now a major hub of the Sun Belt. 　Cities such as Phoenix and Tucson have developed large, sprawling suburban areas. 　Many large companies, such as PetSmart and Circle K, have headquarters in the state, and Arizona is home to major universities, including the University of Arizona and Arizona State University. 　Traditionally, the state is politically known for national conservative figures such as Barry Goldwater and John McCain, though it voted Democratic in the 1996 presidential race and in the 2020 presidential and senatorial elections. 　Arizona is home to a diverse population. 　About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. 　Since the 1980s, the proportion of Hispanics in the state's population has grown significantly owing to migration from Mexico. 　In terms of religion, a substantial portion of the population are followers of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

A weapon, arm or armament is any implement or device that can be used to deter, threaten, inflict physical damage, harm, or kill. 　Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, warfare, or suicide. 　In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target. 　While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many objects are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons. 　Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.

In biology, weapons are traits that are used by males to fight one another off for access to mates. 　A mate is won in battle either by a male chasing off a fellow competitor or killing it off, usually leaving the victor as the only option for the female to reproduce with. 　However, because stronger organisms, whether mentally or physically, are usually favored in combat, this also leads to the evolution of stronger organisms in species that use combat as a way to secure mates, via intrasexual selection. 　Examples of weapons include: antlers, horns, and ossicones.

Tennessee (/ˌtɛnɪˈsiː/ (listen) TEN-ih-SEE, locally /ˈtɛnɪsi/ TEN-iss-ee), officially the State of Tennessee, is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States. 　Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and the 15th-most populous of the 50 states. 　It is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest. 　Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee. 　Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. 　Other major cities include Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville. 　Tennessee's population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9 million. 　Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains. 　Its name derives from "Tanasi", a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement. 　Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. 　It earned the nickname "The Volunteer State" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service. 　A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment. 　As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war. 　During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. 　This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first atomic bombs. 　After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. 　In 2016, the element tennessine was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Tennessee in its discovery. 　Tennessee has also played a major role in the development of many forms of popular music, including country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel. 　Tennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of Appalachia, the Upland South, and the Deep South. 　The Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the Cumberland Plateau contains many scenic valleys and waterfalls. 　The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. 　The state is twice bisected by the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. 　Its economy is dominated by the health care, music, finance, automotive, chemical, electronics, and tourism sectors, and cattle, soybeans, corn, poultry, and cotton are its primary agricultural products. 　The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation's most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.
