<font size=3>
Singh (IPA: /ˈsɪŋ/) is a title, middle name or surname that means "lion" in various South Asian and Southeast Asian communities. 　Traditionally used by the Hindu Kshatriya community, it eventually became a common surname adopted by different communities including Rajputs, Jats, Bhumihars, Gurjars, Yadavs and Sikhs. 　It was later mandated in the late 17th century by Guru Gobind Singh (born Gobind Rai) for all male Sikhs as well, in part as a rejection of caste-based prejudice. 　It has also been adopted by several castes and communities. 　As a surname or a middle name, it is now found throughout the world across communities and religious groups, becoming more of a title than a surname.

<font size=3>
An abbey is a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. 　Abbeys provide a complex of buildings and land for religious activities, work, and housing of Christian monks and nuns. 　The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. 　Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. 　An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. 　The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. 　Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted, or education to the young. 　Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. 　There are many famous abbeys across the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 47°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿47°N 20°E﻿ / 47; 20 Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarország [ˈmɒɟɒrorsaːɡ] (listen)) is a landlocked country in Central Europe. 　Spanning 93,030 square kilometres (35,920 sq mi) of the Carpathian Basin, it is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to the south, Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest, and Austria to the west. 　Hungary has a population of 9.7 million, mostly ethnic Hungarians and a significant Romani minority. 　Hungarian, the official language, is the world's most widely spoken Uralic language and among the few non-Indo-European languages widely spoken in Europe. 　Budapest is the country's capital and largest city; other major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs, and Győr. 　The territory of present-day Hungary has for centuries been a crossroads for various peoples, including Celts, Romans, Germanic tribes, Huns, West Slavs and the Avars. 　The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century AD with the conquest of the Carpathian Basin by Hungarian grand prince Árpád. 　His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. 　By the 12th century, Hungary became a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. 　Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, it was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire (1541–1699). 　Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary, a major power into the early 20th century. 　Austria-Hungary collapsed after World War I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. 　Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. 　Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. 　Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc. 　The removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and subsequently the Soviet Union. 　On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic. 　Hungary joined the European Union in 2004 and has been part of the Schengen Area since 2007. 　Hungary is a middle power in international affairs, owing mostly to its cultural and economic influence. 　It is a high-income economy with a very high human development index, where citizens enjoy universal health care and tuition-free secondary education. 　Hungary has a long history of significant contributions to arts, music, literature, sports, science and technology. 　It is a popular tourist destination in Europe, drawing 24.5 million international tourists in 2019. 　It is a member of numerous international organisations, including the Council of Europe, NATO, United Nations, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Investment Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Visegrád Group.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb>Bomb</a> 
<font size=3>
Look up bomb in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. 　Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. 　Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia. 　The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a "bomb". 　The military use of the term "bomb", or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation. 　Other military explosive weapons not classified as "bombs" include shells, depth charges (used in water), or land mines. 　In unconventional warfare, other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. 　For instance, in recent Middle Eastern conflicts, homemade bombs called "improvised explosive devices" (IEDs) have been employed by insurgent fighters to great effectiveness. 　The word comes from the Latin bombus, which in turn comes from the Greek βόμβος romanized bombos, an onomatopoetic term meaning 'booming', 'buzzing'.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting>Cutting</a> 
<font size=3>
Cutting is the separation or opening of a physical object, into two or more portions, through the application of an acutely directed force. 　Implements commonly used for cutting are the knife and saw, or in medicine and science the scalpel and microtome. 　However, any sufficiently sharp object is capable of cutting if it has a hardness sufficiently larger than the object being cut, and if it is applied with sufficient force. 　Even liquids can be used to cut things when applied with sufficient force (see water jet cutter). 　Cutting is a compressive and shearing phenomenon, and occurs only when the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. 　The simplest applicable equation is: stress = force area {\displaystyle {\text{stress}}={{\text{force}} \over {\text{area}}}} or τ = F A {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {F}{A}}} The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional to the area of contact. 　Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement), the less force is needed to cut something. 　It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. 　This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the easy cutting action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix>Prix</a> 
<font size=3>
Prix was an American power pop band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1975 by Tommy Hoehn and Jon Tiven. 　The group ended up primarily as a studio project. 　Its recordings were produced by Tiven along with former Big Star member Chris Bell, who also played guitar and sang backup vocals. 　Prix is also famous of Banjo playing. 　Alex Chilton also participated in the recordings, along with session drummer Hilly Michaels. 　Although the group generated some major record label interest—notably from Mercury Records and Columbia/CBS Records—it ultimately only released a double A-side single on Ork Records in 1977 and a single on Miracle Records in 1978. 　Its only live performance came at a CBS Records showcase in 1976. 　In 1977, just as Ork Records released the first single and booked the group at CBGB, Prix broke up due both to Hoehn's unwillingness to remain in New York and to creative differences. 　In 1978, two of the songs recorded during the Prix sessions were included on Losing You to Sleep, Hoehn's major label solo debut on London Records. 　In 2002, the Japanese label Air Mail Music released Historix, a CD-only collection of all eleven songs recorded by Prix, plus four alternate versions. 　Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the songs as "11 sparkling, diamond-hard pop gems that will prove to be irresistible to power pop fanatics." 　In 2015, six of the songs were released on the compilation Ork Records: New York, New York. 　In 2016, HoZac Records re-released Historix on vinyl and CD.

A pandemic (/pænˈdɛmɪk/ pan-DEM-ik) is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of individuals. 　A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected individuals is not a pandemic. 　Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected individuals such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide. 　Throughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox. 　The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death—also known as The Plague—which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century. 　The term had not been used then but was used for later epidemics, including the 1918 influenza pandemic—more commonly known as the Spanish flu. 　Current pandemics include HIV/AIDS and COVID-19.

A trophy is a tangible, durable reminder of a specific achievement, and serves as a recognition or evidence of merit. 　Trophies are often awarded for sporting events, from youth sports to professional level athletics. 　In many sports medals (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies. 　Originally the word trophy, derived from the Greek tropaion, referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., headhunting) captured in battle. 　These war trophies commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. 　In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged, but this sense of the word is reflected in hunting trophies and human trophy collecting by serial killers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation>Explanation</a> 
<font size=3>
An explanation is a set of statements usually constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context, and consequences of those facts. 　It may establish rules or laws, and may clarify the existing rules or laws in relation to any objects or phenomena examined. 　Explanation, in philosophy, is a set of statements that makes intelligible the existence or occurrence of an object, event, or state of affairs. 　Among its most common forms are: Causal explanation Deductive-nomological explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization from which it may be derived in a deductive argument (e.g., “All gases expand when heated; this gas was heated; therefore, this gas expanded”) Statistical explanation, which involves subsuming the explanandum under a generalization that gives it inductive support (e.g., “Most people who use tobacco contract cancer; this person used tobacco; therefore, this person contracted cancer”). 　Explanations of human behaviour typically appeal to the subject’s beliefs and desires, as well as other facts about him, and proceed on the assumption that the behaviour in question is rational (at least to a minimum degree). 　Thus an explanation of why the subject removed his coat might cite the fact that the subject felt hot, that the subject desired to feel cooler, and that the subject believed that he would feel cooler if he took off his coat.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty>Liberty</a> 
<font size=3>
Liberty is the ability to do as one pleases, or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant (i.e. privilege). 　It is a synonym for the word freedom. 　In modern politics, liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. 　In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of "sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties". 　Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word "freedom" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. 　In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. 　Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. 　Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. 　In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts. 　Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas, derived from the name of the goddess Libertas, who, along with more modern personifications, is often used to portray the concept, and the archaic Roman god Liber.　[citation needed] The word "liberty" is often used in slogans, such as in "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".

A clan is a group of people united by actual or perceived kinship and descent. 　Even if lineage details are unknown, clans may claim descent from founding member or apical ancestor. 　Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be endogamous, meaning that their members can marry one another. 　Clans preceded[citation needed] more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country.　[citation needed] Members may identify with a coat of arms or other symbol to show that they are an independent clan[clarify]. 　Kinship-based groups may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a "stipulated" common ancestor who serves as a symbol of the clan's unity.

<font size=3>
The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures that are held to be sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other religions. 　The Bible is an anthology – a compilation of texts of a variety of forms – originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. 　These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, among other genres. 　The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. 　Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and interpret the text can vary. 　The religious texts were compiled by different religious communities into various official collections. 　The earliest contained the first five books of the Bible. 　It is called the Torah in Hebrew and the Pentateuch (meaning five books) in Greek; the second oldest part was a collection of narrative histories and prophecies (the Nevi'im); the third collection (the Ketuvim) contains psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories. 　"Tanakh" is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of those three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah ("Teaching"), the Nevi'im ("Prophets"), and the Ketuvim ("Writings"). 　The Masoretic Text is the medieval version of the Tanakh, in Hebrew and Aramaic, that is considered the authoritative text of the Hebrew Bible by modern Rabbinic Judaism. 　The Septuagint (meaning the Translation of the Seventy) is a Koine Greek translation of the Tanakh from the third and second centuries BCE (Before Common Era); it largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible. 　Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the Old Testament. 　The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books. 　The gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts quickly coalesced into the New Testament. 　With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is the best-selling publication of all time. 　It has had a profound influence both on Western culture and history and on cultures around the globe. 　The study of it through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well. 　The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.

<font size=3>
A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. 　Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. 　All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. 　Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. 　For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for "STOP"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. 　Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. 　The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.　[citation needed] The academic study of symbols is semiotics. 　In cartography, an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.

Nu ("Watery One") or Nun ("The Inert One") (Ancient Egyptian: nnw Nānaw; Coptic: Ⲛⲟⲩⲛ Noun), is the personification of the primordial watery abyss which existed at the time of creation and from which the creator sun god Ra arose, in ancient Egyptian religion. 　Nu is one of the eight deities of the Ogdoad representing ancient Egyptian primordial Chaos from which the primordial mound arose. 　Nun can be seen as the first of all the gods and the creator of reality and personification of the cosmos. 　Nun is also considered the god that will destroy existence and return everything to the Nun from whence it came. 　No cult was addressed to Nun. 　The consort of Nun was the goddess Nunut or Naunet (Ancient Egyptian: nnwt). 　The names of Nu and Naunet are written with the determiners for sky and water.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue>Revenue</a> 
<font size=3>
In accounting, revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business. 　Commercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. 　Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other fees. 　"Revenue" may refer to income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit, earned during a period of time, as in "Last year, Company X had revenue of $42 million". 　Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total expenses in a given period. 　In accounting, in the balance statement, revenue is a subsection of the Equity section and revenue increases equity, it is often referred to as the "top line" due to its position on the income statement at the very top. 　This is to be contrasted with the "bottom line" which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses). 　In general usage, revenue is the total amount of income by the sale of goods or services related to the company's operations. 　Sales revenue is income received from selling goods or services over a period of time. 　Tax revenue is income that a government receives from taxpayers. 　Fundraising revenue is income received by a charity from donors etc. to further its social purposes. 　In more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income based on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a government or government agency. 　Two common accounting methods, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for measuring revenue. 　Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are usually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting principles or on International Financial Reporting Standards. 　In a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger accounts that are summarized periodically under the heading "Revenue" or "Revenues" on an income statement. 　Revenue account-names describe the type of revenue, such as "repair service revenue", "rent revenue earned" or "sales".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle>Rifle</a> 
<font size=3>
A rifle is a long-barreled firearm designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall. 　In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting. 　Rifles are used extensively in warfare, law enforcement, hunting, shooting sports, and crime. 　The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools. 　By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun rifle is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger (e.g., personnel halting and stimulation response rifle, which is actually a laser dazzler). 　Like all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other propulsive means are used, such as compressed air in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (plinking). 　The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns (e.g., arquebuses, muskets) is the rifling within its barrel. 　The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called lands; they make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin. 　When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, increasing accuracy and hence effective range. 　Early long rifles were muzzle-loaders firing spherical balls; the introduction of breech-loading allowed the use of elongated and aerodynamically efficient bullets, which did not yaw or tumble significantly in flight due to the spin.　[citation needed]
