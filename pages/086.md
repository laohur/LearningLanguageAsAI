<font size=3>
A butler is a person who works in a house serving and is a domestic worker in a large household. 　In great houses, the household is sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry. 　Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor, and housekeepers caring for the entire house and its appearance. 　A butler is usually male, and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually a woman, and in charge of female servants. 　Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants. 　The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. 　He can also sometimes function as a chauffeur. 　In older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as majordomo, butler administrator, house manager, manservant, staff manager, chief of staff, staff captain, estate manager, and head of household staff are sometimes given. 　The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. 　In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. 　The butler can also be assisted by a head footman or footboy called the under-butler.

<font size=3>
Printing is a process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or template. 　The earliest non-paper products involving printing include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus. 　The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was woodblock printing, which appeared in China before 220 AD for cloth printing. 　However, it would not be applied to paper until the seventh century. 　Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. 　The technology of printing played a key role in the development of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo>Anglo</a> 
<font size=3>
Anglo is a prefix indicating a relation to, or descent from, the Angles, England, English culture, the English people or the English language, such as in the term Anglosphere. 　It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of British descent in Anglo-America, the Anglophone Caribbean, South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand. 　It is used in Canada to differentiate between the French speakers (Francophone) of mainly Quebec and some parts of New Brunswick, and the English speakers (Anglophone) in the rest of Canada. 　It is also used in the United States to distinguish the Latino population from the non-Latino white majority. 　Anglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote English- in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. 　The word is derived from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, East Anglia. 　Anglia and England both mean land of the Angles, a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln, that is, the region of today's Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula. 　(There are various hypotheses for the origin of the name 'Angeln'.) 　It is also often used to refer to British in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707, for example such as in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government. 　Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being Anglo. 　Anglo is not an easily defined term. 　For traditionalists, there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own. 　For example, the purpose of the -o ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example Anglo-Saxon meaning of Angle and Saxon origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, Latino and Anglo. 　However, a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. 　The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified.

Muslims (Arabic: المسلمون, al-Muslimūn, transl. "Submitters [to God]") are people who adhere to Islam, a monotheistic religion belonging to the Abrahamic tradition. 　They consider the Quran, the foundational religious text of Islam, to be the verbatim word of the God of Abraham (or Allah) as it was revealed to Muhammad, the main Islamic prophet. 　The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith). 　With an estimated population of almost 1.9 billion followers as of 2020 year estimation, Muslims comprise more than 24.9% of the world's total population. 　In descending order, the percentage of people who identify as Muslims on each continental landmass stands at: 45% of Africa, 25% of Asia and Oceania (collectively), 6% of Europe, and 1% of the Americas. 　Additionally, in subdivided geographical regions, the figure stands at: 91% of the Middle East–North Africa, 90% of Central Asia, 65% of the Caucasus, 42% of Southeast Asia, 32% of South Asia, and 42% of sub-Saharan Africa. 　While there are several Islamic schools and branches, the two largest denominations are Sunni Islam (75–90% of all Muslims) and Shia Islam (10–20% of all Muslims). 　By sheer numbers, South Asia accounts for the largest portion (31%) of the global Muslim population, primarily across three countries: Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. 　By country, Indonesia is the largest in the Muslim world, holding around 12% of all Muslims worldwide; outside of the Muslim-majority countries, India and China are home to the largest (11%) and second-largest (2%) Muslim populations, respectively. 　Due to high Muslim population growth, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world.

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 　More precisely, an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold, or n {\displaystyle n} -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space. 　One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not lemniscates. 　Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. 　Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane. 　The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. 　Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. 　The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans). 　Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. 　One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. 　A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. 　Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity. 　The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.

<font size=3>
In psychology, compensation is a strategy whereby one covers up, consciously or unconsciously, weaknesses, frustrations, desires, or feelings of inadequacy or incompetence in one life area through the gratification or (drive towards) excellence in another area. 　Compensation can cover up either real or imagined deficiencies and personal or physical inferiority. 　Positive compensations may help one to overcome one's difficulties. 　On the other hand, negative compensations do not, which results in a reinforced feeling of inferiority. 　There are two kinds of negative compensation: Overcompensation, characterized by a superiority goal, leads to striving for power, dominance, self-esteem, and self-devaluation. 　Undercompensation, which includes a demand for help, leads to a lack of courage and a fear for life. 　A well-known example of failing overcompensation is observed in people going through a midlife-crisis. 　Approaching midlife, many people lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.

<font size=3>
A porch (from Old French porche, from Latin porticus "colonnade", from porta "passage") is a room or gallery located in front of an entrance of a building. 　A porch is placed in front of the facade of a building it commands, and forms a low front. 　Alternatively, it may be a vestibule, or a projecting building that houses the entrance door of a building. 　Porches exist in both religious and secular architecture. 　There are various styles of porches, many of which depend on the architectural tradition of its location. 　Porches allow for sufficient space for a person to comfortably pause before entering or after exiting a building, or to relax on. 　Many porches are open on the outward side with balustrade supported by balusters that usually encircles the entire porch except where stairs are found. 　The word "porch" is almost exclusively used for a structure that is outside the main walls of a building or house. 　Porches can exist under the same roof line as the rest of the building, or as towers and turrets that are supported by simple porch posts or ornate colonnades and arches. 　Examples of porches include those found in Queen Anne style architecture, Victorian style houses, Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, or any of the American Colonial style buildings and homes. 　Some porches are small and cover only the entrance area of a building. 　Other porches are larger, sometimes extending beyond an entrance by wrapping around the sides of a building, or even wrapping around completely to surround an entire building. 　A porch can be part of the ground floor or an upper floor, a design used in the Mrs. Lydia Johnson House (built in 1895).

Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation producing computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. 　Headquartered at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. 　Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. 　Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2019. 　It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (Facebook). 　Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 　It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. 　The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. 　Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2  billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011. 　As of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. 　The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio). 　Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy. 　This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. 　Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999. 　Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. 　In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. 　As of 2022[update], Microsoft has the fourth-highest global brand valuation. 　Microsoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.

In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as (1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus and; (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as wrist joints. 　This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, bracelet lines, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. 　As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist.
