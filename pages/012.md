<font size=3>
News is information about current events. 　This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. 　News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media. 　Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. 　Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. 　Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. 　Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. 　Having developed in China over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. 　In the 20th century, radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. 　Whilst in the 21st, the internet has also begun to play a similar role.

<font size=3>
In animal anatomy, the mouth, also known as the oral cavity, or in Latin cavum oriscode: lat promoted to code: la , is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds. 　It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal, bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx. 　In tetrapods, it contains the tongue and, except for some like birds, teeth. 　This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity, from the Latin buccacode: lat promoted to code: la ("cheek"). 　Some animal phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a complete digestive system, with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. 　Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_(archaeology)>Natural (archaeology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In archaeology, natural is a term to denote a layer (stratum) in the stratigraphic record where there is no evidence of human impact on the environment. 　While there may be "natural" layers interbedded with archaeologically interesting layers, such as when a site was abandoned for long periods between occupations, the top (or horizon) of the natural layer below which there is no anthropogenic activity on site, and thus where the archaeological record begins, is the point to terminate digging. 　Usually it is the underlying geological makeup of the site that was formed by geologic processes. 　It is the goal of complete excavation to remove the entirety of the archaeological record all the way to the "natural", leaving only the natural deposits of pre-human activity on site. 　If the excavation is related to development, the impact assessment may stipulate excavation will cease at a certain depth, because the nature of the development will not disturb remains below a certain level. 　Such an excavation may not reach a natural or sterile layer.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 60°N 110°W﻿ / ﻿60°N 110°W﻿ / 60; -110 Canada is a country in North America. 　Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering over 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. 　Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border. 　Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. 　Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. 　Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. 　As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. 　In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. 　This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. 　This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. 　Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. 　The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. 　The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) at the federal level. 　It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. 　It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. 　Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. 　A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per capita income globally and the fifteenth-highest ranking on the Human Development Index. 　Its advanced economy is the eighth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. 　Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States.

Related is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on The WB from October 5, 2005, to March 20, 2006. 　It revolves around the lives of four close-knit sisters of Italian descent, raised in Brooklyn and living in Manhattan. 　The show was created by former Sex and the City writer Liz Tuccillo, and executive produced by Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman. 　Despite heavy promotion, initial ratings did not warrant the show being picked up for a second season when The WB network was folded into The CW.

<font size=3>
In hydrology, stage refers to the water level in a river or stream with respect to a chosen reference height. 　Stage is important because direct measurements of river discharge are very difficult while water surface elevation measurements are comparatively easy. 　In order to convert stage into discharge, scientists can use a combination of tracer studies, observations of high water marks, numerical modeling, and/or satellite or aerial photography. 　The relationship between stage and discharge is called a rating curve.

<font size=3>
In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction. 　The fundamental notion that a physical property can be "quantized" is referred to as "the hypothesis of quantization". 　This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum. 　For example, a photon is a single quantum of light (or of any other form of electromagnetic radiation). 　Similarly, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values. 　(Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom.) 　Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of quantum mechanics. 　Quantization of energy and its influence on how energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature.

In metrology (the science of measurement), a standard (or etalon) is an object, system, or experiment that bears a defined relationship to a unit of measurement of a physical quantity. 　Standards are the fundamental reference for a system of weights and measures, against which all other measuring devices are compared. 　Historical standards for length, volume, and mass were defined by many different authorities, which resulted in confusion and inaccuracy of measurements. 　Modern measurements are defined in relationship to internationally standardized reference objects, which are used under carefully controlled laboratory conditions to define the units of length, mass, electrical potential, and other physical quantities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest>Interest</a> 
<font size=3>
In finance and economics, interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. 　It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. 　It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs. 　For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. 　In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower. 　Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. 　(Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.) 　The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). 　Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. 　Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. 　In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis>Analysis</a> 
<font size=3>
Analysis (PL: analyses) is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. 　The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. 　The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analysis, "a breaking-up" or "an untying;" from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening"). 　From it also comes the word's plural, analyses. 　As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen, René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. 　It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name). 　The converse of analysis is synthesis: putting the pieces back together again in new or different whole.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running>Running</a> 
<font size=3>
Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. 　Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). 　This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. 　A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. 　The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. 　Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy. 　It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. 　Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. 　Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. 　Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.

<font size=3>
Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. 　Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. 　The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. 　Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts. 　Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. 　The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. 　This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. 　The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. 　Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council.

In biological taxonomy, race is an informal rank in the taxonomic hierarchy for which various definitions exist. 　Sometimes it is used to denote a level below that of subspecies, while at other times it is used as a synonym for subspecies. 　It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one race. 　Races may be genetically distinct populations of individuals within the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, e.g. geographically, or physiologically. 　Genetic isolation between races is not complete, but genetic differences may have accumulated that are not (yet) sufficient to separate species. 　The term is recognized by some, but not governed by any of the formal codes of biological nomenclature. 　Taxonomic units below the level of subspecies are not typically applied to animals.

<font size=3>
Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. 　With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. 　The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. 　Television. 　The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane. 　Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. 　They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. 　After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends. 　Filming took place at Warner Bros. 　Studios in Burbank, California. 　The show ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. 　The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s. 　Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time. 　The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. 　The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and no. 5 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. 　In 1997, the episode "The One with the Prom Video" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. 　In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time, and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time. 　The sitcom's cast members returned for a reunion special aired on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.
