## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean>Ocean</a> 
<font size=3>
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. 　An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. 　Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest). 　Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. 　The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. 　Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. 　Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. 　The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. 　The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. 　The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. 　This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. 　Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. 　Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. 　This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. 　Light penetrates to a depth of only a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. 　The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. 　Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. 　Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. 　In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). 　Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). 　Deep ocean temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean. 　Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents. 　These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity. 　Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves. 　Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, Agulhas Current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 　Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe. 　This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean. 　Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 　This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water. 　The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification. 　The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation. 　It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to food and other resources. 　Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species. 　However, the ocean is subject to numerous human-caused environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, and effects of climate change on oceans, such as ocean warming, ocean acidification, sea level rise and many more. 　The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.

<font size=3>
Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"[citation needed] or "support"). 　The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. 　In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). 　The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects. 　Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract art). 　Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism). 　A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. 　Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke>Duke</a> 
<font size=3>
Duke is a male title either of a monarch ruling over a duchy, or of a member of royalty, or nobility. 　As rulers, dukes are ranked below emperors, kings, grand princes, grand dukes, and sovereign princes. 　As royalty or nobility, they are ranked below princes and grand dukes. 　The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin dux, 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. 　In most countries, the word duchess is the female equivalent. 　Following the reforms of the emperor Diocletian (which separated the civilian and military administrations of the Roman provinces), a dux became the military commander in each province. 　The title dux, Hellenised to doux, survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it continued in several contexts, signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. 　Later on, in the 11th century, the title Megas Doux was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy. 　During the Middle Ages the title (as Herzog) signified first among the Germanic monarchies. 　Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. 　A duke may or may not be, ipso facto, a member of the nation's peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g. Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed. 　During the 19th century, many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by dukes or grand dukes. 　But at present, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. 　Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. 　In Sweden, members of the Royal Family are given a personal dukedom at birth. 　The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of duke or duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. 　In some realms the relative status of "duke" and "prince", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied—e.g., in Italy and Germany. 　A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is married to a duke, is normally styled duchess. 　Queen Elizabeth II, however, was known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.

<font size=3>
A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. 　The word is derived from the Latin name palātium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences. 　Most European languages have a version of the term (palais, palazzo, palacio, etc.), and many use it for a wider range of buildings than English. 　In many parts of Europe, the equivalent term is also applied to large private houses in cities, especially of the aristocracy; often the term for a large country house is different. 　Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings. 　The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions such as a movie palace. 　A palace is distinguished from a castle while the latter clearly is fortified or has the style of a fortification, whereas a palace does not.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice>Nice</a> 
<font size=3>
Nice (/niːs/ NEESS, French pronunciation: [nis] (listen); Niçard: Niça, classical norm, or Nissa, nonstandard, pronounced [ˈnisa]; Italian: Nizza [ˈnittsa]; Ligurian: Nissa; Ancient Greek: Νίκαια; Latin: Nicaea) is the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department in France. 　The Nice agglomeration extends far beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly 1 million on an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi). 　Located on the French Riviera, the southeastern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the French Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. 　Nice is approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) from the principality of Monaco and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. 　Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region. 　The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. 　The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. 　Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Νίκαια, Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. 　Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. 　Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. 　From 1388 it was a dominion of Savoy, then became part of the French First Republic between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the legal predecessor of the Kingdom of Italy, until its re-annexation by France in 1860. 　The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending their winters there. 　In 1931, following its refurbishment the city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais ("Walkway of the English"), was inaugurated by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught; it owes its name to visitors to the resort. 　These included Queen Victoria along with her son Edward VII who spent winters there, as well as Henry Cavendish, born in Nice, who discovered hydrogen. 　The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman. 　Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts. 　International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. 　Frank Harris wrote several books including his autobiography My Life and Loves in Nice. 　Friedrich Nietzsche spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra here. 　Additionally, Russian writer Anton Chekhov completed his play Three Sisters while living in Nice. 　Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes. 　Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, heir apparent to Imperial Russia, died in Nice and was a patron of the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice where Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, morganatic wife of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia, is buried. 　Also buried there are General Dmitry Shcherbachev and General Nikolai Yudenich, leaders of the anti-Communist White Movement. 　Those interred at the Cimetière du Château include celebrated jeweler Alfred Van Cleef, Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, founder of the Mercedes car company, film director Louis Feuillade, poet Agathe-Sophie Sasserno, dancer Carolina Otero, Asterix comics creator René Goscinny, The Phantom of the Opera author Gaston Leroux, French prime minister Léon Gambetta, and the first president of the International Court of Justice José Gustavo Guerrero. 　Because of its historical importance as a winter resort town for the European aristocracy and the resulting mix of cultures found in the city, UNESCO proclaimed Nice a World Heritage Site in 2021. 　The city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country, and it is the second most visited metropolis in the hexagon, receiving 4 million tourists every year. 　It also has the third busiest airport in France, after the two main Parisian ones. 　It is the historical capital city of the County of Nice (French: Comté de Nice, Niçard: Countèa de Nissa).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel>Steel</a> 
<font size=3>
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. 　Many other elements may be present or added. 　Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium. 　Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, cars, machines, electrical appliances, and weapons. 　Iron is the base metal of steel. 　Depending on the temperature, it can take two crystalline forms (allotropic forms): body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic. 　The interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. 　In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or soft and easily formed. 　In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations. 　The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. 　Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), impedes the movement of the dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. 　These qualities include the hardness, quenching behaviour, need for annealing, tempering behaviour, yield strength, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. 　The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility. 　Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel. 　This was followed by the open-hearth furnace and then the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century. 　With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. 　Mild steel replaced wrought iron. 　The German states saw major steel prowess over Europe in the 19th century. 　Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. 　Today, steel is one of the most commonly manufactured materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. 　Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organisations. 　The modern steel industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the world, but is one of the most energy and greenhouse gas emission intense industries, contributing 8% of global emissions. 　However, steel is also very reusable: it is one of the world's most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60% globally.

<font size=3>
A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van. 　It is most commonly used in public transport, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. 　Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. 　The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. 　Coaches are used for longer-distance services. 　Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. 　Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. 　In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence. 　Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles. 　Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. 　The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895. 　Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. 　As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world.

<font size=3>
A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. 　Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. 　However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. 　In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. 　Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. 　Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. 　Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. 　Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. 　House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. 　Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. 　Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions. 　Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats), wind (e.g. sailboats), and inboard/outboard motors (including gasoline, diesel, and electric).

<font size=3>
Rome City Centre Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city of Italy. 　It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. 　With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. 　The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. 　Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. 　Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. 　Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. 　Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City". 　Rome is generally considered to be the "cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture", and the centre of the Catholic Church. 　Rome's history spans 28 centuries. 　While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. 　The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. 　Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. 　It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. 　Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). 　After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. 　Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. 　In this way, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. 　Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. 　In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic. 　In 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy. 　Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. 　The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 　The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many international businesses, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. 　Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. 　The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.

<font size=3>
Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. 　In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. 　In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. 　In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestation and develops further in its mother's womb pouch. 　It is not only mammals that give birth. 　Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. 　Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.

A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. 　A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. 　Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances. 　The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing). 　The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. 　The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world. 　Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. 　These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. 　For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. 　In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability. 　In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws. 　They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera>Opera</a> 
<font size=3>
Opera is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers. 　Such a "work" (the literal translation of the Italian word "opera") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. 　The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. 　Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another. 　Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. 　Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as Singspiel and Opéra comique. 　In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias. 　The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama. 　Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi, notably L'Orfeo, and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. 　In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel. 　Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. 　The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), and The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), landmarks in the German tradition. 　The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style. 　It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber's introduction of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic Opera). 　The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany. 　The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century. 　During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia. 　The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams). 　With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. 　Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. 　Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. 　Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(archaeology)>Survey (archaeology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In archaeology, survey or field survey is a type of field research by which archaeologists (often landscape archaeologists) search for archaeological sites and collect information about the location, distribution and organization of past human cultures across a large area (e.g. typically in excess of one hectare, and often in excess of many km2). 　Archaeologists conduct surveys to search for particular archaeological sites or kinds of sites, to detect patterns in the distribution of material culture over regions, to make generalizations or test hypotheses about past cultures, and to assess the risks that development projects will have adverse impacts on archaeological heritage. 　The surveys may be: 　(a) intrusive or non-intrusive, depending on the needs of the survey team (and the risk of destroying archaeological evidence if intrusive methods are used) and; 　(b) extensive or intensive, depending on the types of research questions being asked of the landscape in question. 　Surveys can be a practical way to decide whether or not to carry out an excavation (as a way of recording the basic details of a possible site), but may also be ends in themselves, as they produce important information about past human activities in a regional context. 　A common role of a field survey is in assessment of the potential archaeological significance of places where development is proposed. 　This is usually connected to construction work and road building. 　The assessment determines whether the area of development impact is likely to contain significant archaeological resources and makes recommendations as to whether the archaeological remains can be avoided or an excavation is necessary before development work can commence. 　Archaeologists use a variety of tools when carrying out surveys, including GIS, GPS, remote sensing, geophysical survey and aerial photography.

<font size=3>
Michigan (/ˈmɪʃɪɡən/ (listen)) is a state in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwestern United States. 　With a population of nearly 10.12 million and an area of nearly 97,000 sq mi (250,000 km2), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by area east of the Mississippi River. 　Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. 　Metro Detroit is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. 　Its name derives from a gallicized variant of the original Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (mishigami), meaning "large water" or "large lake". 　Michigan consists of two peninsulas. 　The Lower Peninsula resembles the shape of a mitten, and comprises a majority of the state's land area. 　The Upper Peninsula (often called "the U.P.") is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile (8 km) channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. 　The Mackinac Bridge connects the peninsulas. 　Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the United States, being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair. 　It also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds. 　Michigan has the second-most water of any state, behind only Alaska. 　The area was first occupied by a succession of Native American tribes over thousands of years. 　In the 17th century, French explorers claimed it as part of the New France colony, when it was largely inhabited by indigenous peoples. 　French and Canadian traders and settlers, Métis, and others migrated to the area, settling largely along the waterways. 　After France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the region came under British rule. 　Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War. 　The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory. 　Michigan Territory was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after the War of 1812. 　Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a free one. 　It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region, attracting immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from many European countries. 　Immigrants from Finland, Macedonia, and the Netherlands were especially numerous. 　Migration from Appalachia and of Black Southerners as part of the Great Migration increased in the 1930s, with many settling in Metro Detroit. 　Although Michigan has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major national economic force. 　It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). 　Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism due to the abundance of natural resources. 　The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry.

The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 　Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 　Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. 　Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids. 　The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. 　Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. 　They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. 　Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. 　This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
