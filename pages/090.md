<font size=3>
A meal is an eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes consumption of food. 　The names used for specific meals in English vary, depending on the speaker's culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. 　Although they can be eaten anywhere, meals typically take place in homes, restaurants, and cafeterias. 　Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. 　Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. 　A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks. 　The type of food that is served or consumed at any given time depends on regional customs. 　Three main meals are often eaten in the morning, early afternoon, and evening in most modern civilizations. 　Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. 　Some serve dinner as the main meal at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper or dinner. 　Except for "breakfast", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.

<font size=3>
Look up strict in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　In mathematical writing, the term strict refers to the property of excluding equality and equivalence and often occurs in the context of inequality and monotonic functions. 　It is often attached to a technical term to indicate that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. 　The opposite is non-strict, which is often understood to be the case but can be put explicitly for clarity. 　In some contexts, the word "proper" can also be used as a mathematical synonym for "strict".

<font size=3>
Voltage, also known as electric pressure, electric tension, or (electric) potential difference, is the difference in electric potential between two points. 　In a static electric field, it corresponds to the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. 　In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage is named volt.　: 166  The voltage between points can be caused by the build-up of electric charge (e.g., a capacitor), and from an electromotive force (e.g., electromagnetic induction in generator, inductors, and transformers). 　On a macroscopic scale, a potential difference can be caused by electrochemical processes (e.g., cells and batteries), the pressure-induced piezoelectric effect, and the thermoelectric effect. 　A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage between two points in a system. 　Often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. 　A voltage can represent either a source of energy or the loss, dissipation, or storage of energy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature>Curvature</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, curvature is any of several strongly related concepts in geometry. 　Intuitively, the curvature is the amount by which a curve deviates from being a straight line, or a surface deviates from being a plane. 　For curves, the canonical example is that of a circle, which has a curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius. 　Smaller circles bend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. 　The curvature at a point of a differentiable curve is the curvature of its osculating circle, that is the circle that best approximates the curve near this point. 　The curvature of a straight line is zero. 　In contrast to the tangent, which is a vector quantity, the curvature at a point is typically a scalar quantity, that is, it is expressed by a single real number. 　For surfaces (and, more generally for higher-dimensional manifolds), that are embedded in a Euclidean space, the concept of curvature is more complex, as it depends on the choice of a direction on the surface or manifold. 　This leads to the concepts of maximal curvature, minimal curvature, and mean curvature. 　For Riemannian manifolds (of dimension at least two) that are not necessarily embedded in a Euclidean space, one can define the curvature intrinsically, that is without referring to an external space. 　See Curvature of Riemannian manifolds for the definition, which is done in terms of lengths of curves traced on the manifold, and expressed, using linear algebra, by the Riemann curvature tensor.

Amsterdam (/ˈæmstərdæm/ AM-stər-dam, UK also /ˌæmstərˈdæm/ AM-stər-DAM, Dutch: [ˌɑmstərˈdɑm] (listen); lit. 　"The Dam on the River Amstel") is the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands, with The Hague being the seat of government. 　It has a population of 921,402 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan area. 　Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the "Venice of the North", for its large number of canals, now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Amstel River that was dammed to control flooding; the city's name derives from the Amstel dam. 　Originally a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became a major world port during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, when the Netherlands was an economic powerhouse. 　Amsterdam is the leading center for finance and trade, as well as a hub of production of secular art. 　In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. 　The canals of Amsterdam and the 19-20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are both on the UNESCO World Heritage List. 　Sloten, annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century. 　The city has a long tradition of openness, liberalism, and tolerance. 　Cycling is key to the city's modern character, and there are numerous biking paths and lanes spread throughout the entire city. 　Amsterdam's main attractions include its historic canals; the Rijksmuseumcode: nld promoted to code: nl , the state museum with a vast collection of Dutch Golden Age art; the Van Gogh Museum; the Dam Square, where the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and former city hall (stadhuiscode: nld promoted to code: nl ) are located; the Amsterdam Museum; Stedelijk Museum, with modern art; Hermitage Amsterdam, the Concertgebouwcode: nld promoted to code: nl concert hall; the Anne Frank House; the Het Scheepvaartmuseumcode: nld promoted to code: nl , the Heineken Experience, the Natura Artis Magistracode: lat promoted to code: la ; Hortus Botanicus, NEMO, the red-light district and many cannabis coffee shops. 　The city is also well known for its nightlife and festival activity; with several of its nightclubs (Melkwegcode: nld promoted to code: nl , Paradiso) among the world's most famous. 　Primarily known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and narrow canal houses with gabled façades; well-preserved legacies of the city's 17th-century Golden Age, and the establishment of the Van Gogh Museum, displaying the work of the famous Dutch modern artist, have attracted millions of visitors to Amsterdam annually. 　The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered the oldest "modern" securities market stock exchange in the world. 　As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands. 　Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters in the city, including: the Philips conglomerate, AkzoNobel, Booking.com, TomTom, and ING. Many of the world's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as leading technology companies Uber, Netflix and Tesla. 　In 2022, Amsterdam was ranked the ninth-best city in the world to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. 　The city was ranked 4th place globally as top tech hub in the Savills Tech Cities 2019 report (2nd in Europe), and 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their Innovation Cities Index 2009. 　The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. 　The KLM hub and Amsterdam's main airport, Schiphol, is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, the third busiest in Europe, and the 11th busiest airport in the world. 　The Dutch capital is considered one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with at least 177 nationalities represented. 　Immigration and ethnic segregation in Amsterdam is a current issue. 　A few of Amsterdam's notable residents throughout its history include painters Rembrandt and Vincent van Gogh, seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, and the Holocaust victim and diarist Anne Frank.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga>Manga</a> 
<font size=3>
Manga (Japanese: 漫画 [maŋga]) are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. 　Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art. 　The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. 　Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country. 　In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. 　The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among others. 　Many manga are translated into other languages. 　Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry. 　By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion ($6–7 billion), with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person). 　In 2020 Japan's manga market value hit a new record of ¥612.6 billion due to the fast growth of digital manga sales as well as increase of print sales. 　Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. 　Beginning with the late 2010s manga started massively outselling American comics. 　In 2020 the North American manga market was valued at almost $250 million. 　According to NPD BookScan manga made up 76% of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021. 　The fast growth of the North American manga market has been attributed to manga's wide availability on digital reading apps, book retailer chains such as Barnes & Noble and online retailers such as Amazon as well as the increased streaming of anime. 　According to Jean-Marie Bouissou, manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005. 　This is equivalent to approximately 3 times that of the United States and was valued at about €460 million ($640 million). 　In Europe and the Middle East, the market was valued at $250 million in 2012. 　Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white—due to time constraints, artistic reasons (as coloring could lessen the impact of the artwork) and to keep printing costs low—although some full-color manga exist (e.g., Colorful). 　In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. 　Collected chapters are usually republished in tankōbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively paperback books. 　A manga artist (mangaka in Japanese) typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company. 　If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or during its run. 　Sometimes, manga are based on previous live-action or animated films. 　Manga-influenced comics, among original works, exist in other parts of the world, particularly in those places that speak Chinese ("manhua"), Korean ("manhwa"), English ("OEL manga"), and French ("manfra"), as well as in the nation of Algeria ("DZ-manga").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile>Exile</a> 
<font size=3>
Exile is primarily penal expulsion from one's native country, and secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one's homeland under either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high purpose. 　Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced from their homeland. 　In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. 　Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. 　Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property. 　The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced. 　"Government in exile" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. 　Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit. 　Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

<font size=3>
A garrison (from the French garnison, itself from the verb garnir, "to equip") is any body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it. 　The term now often applies to certain facilities that constitute a military base or fortified military headquarters. 　A garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle, ship, or similar site. 　"Garrison town" is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby. 　"Garrison towns" (Arabic: أمصار, romanized: amsar) were used during the Arab Islamic conquests of Middle Eastern lands by Arab-Muslim armies to increase their dominance over indigenous populations. 　In order to occupy non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the spoils of war. 　The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. 　A secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions in the Arabian Peninsula in order to proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their midst. 　In the United Kingdom, "Garrison" also specifically refers to any of the major military stations such as Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Tidworth, Bulford, and London, which have more than one barracks or camp and their own military headquarters, usually commanded by a colonel, brigadier or major-general, assisted by a garrison sergeant major. 　In Ireland, Association football (as distinct from Gaelic football) has historically been termed the "garrison game" or the "garrison sport" for its connections with British military serving in Irish cities and towns.

A veteran (from Latin vetus 'old') is a person who has significant experience (and is usually adept and esteemed) and expertise in a particular occupation or field. 　A military veteran is a person who is no longer in a military. 　A military veteran that has served directly in combat in a war is further defined as a war veteran (although not all military conflicts, or areas in which armed combat took place, are necessarily referred to as wars). 　Military veterans are unique as a group as their lived experience is so strongly connected to the conduct of war in general and application of professional violence in particular. 　Therefore, there are a large body of knowledge developed through centuries of scholarly studies that seek to describe, understand and explain their lived experience in and out of service. 　Griffith with colleagues provides an overview of this research field that addresses veterans general health, transition from military service to civilian life, homelessness, veteran employment, civic engagement and veteran identity as recurrent investigative topics in the field.

Brisbane (/ˈbrɪzbən/ (listen) BRIZ-bən) is the capital and most populous city of Queensland, and the third-most populous city in Australia and Oceania with a population of approximately 2.6 million. 　Brisbane lies at the centre of South East Queensland, which includes several other regional centres and cities. 　The central business district is situated within a peninsula of the Brisbane River about 15 km (9 mi) from its mouth at Moreton Bay. 　Brisbane is located in the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. 　It sprawls across several local government areas, most centrally the City of Brisbane. 　The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite. 　The Aboriginal traditional owners of Meanjin include the Yugara, Turrbal and Quandamooka peoples. 　Brisbane occupies the land of a number of Aboriginal language groups, primarily the Yugara language group which includes the Turrbal language. 　The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney colony, and soon moved to North Quay in 1825 on the banks of the Brisbane River, so named for Sir Thomas Brisbane. 　German Lutherans established the first free settlement of Zion Hill at Nundah in 1838, and in 1859 Brisbane was chosen as Queensland's capital when the state separated from New South Wales. 　By the late 19th century, the city had grown into a major port and centre of immigration. 　During World War II, the Allied command in the South West Pacific was based in the city, along with the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur of the United States Army. 　Brisbane is classified as a global city, and is a major centre of research and innovation in the Asia-Pacific, particularly in medicine and biotechnology. 　A transport hub, Brisbane is served by large rail, bus and ferry networks, as well as Brisbane Airport and the Port of Brisbane, Australia's third-largest seaport. 　A diverse city with over 32% of its metropolitan population being foreign-born, Brisbane is frequently ranked highly in lists of the most liveable cities. 　Galleries and museums are an important part of the city's culture, with the most prominent being the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art. 　Brisbane has hosted major events including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo 88, the 2014 G20 summit, and will host the 2032 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. 　Brisbane is a popular tourist destination. 　Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the City Botanic Gardens, King George Square and City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens and Lookout and the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting>Conducting</a> 
<font size=3>
Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. 　It has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture." 　The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score in a way that reflects the specific indications in that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by ensemble members, and "shape" the phrasing where appropriate. 　Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, usually with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals such as facial expression and eye contact. 　A conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions to their musicians in rehearsal. 　The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices. 　Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. 　In Baroque music, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. 　Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. 　Communication is typically mostly non-verbal during a performance. 　However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung. 　Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. 　They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (such as in tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. 　They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. 　Orchestras, choirs, concert bands, and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff>Cliff</a> 
<font size=3>
In geography and geology, a cliff is an area of rock which has a general angle defined by the vertical, or nearly vertical. 　Cliffs are formed by the processes of weathering and erosion, with the effect of gravity. 　Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. 　Cliffs are usually composed of rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. 　The sedimentary rocks that are most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. 　Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs. 　An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff formed by the movement of a geologic fault, a landslide, or sometimes by rock slides or falling rocks which change the differential erosion of the rock layers. 　Most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base. 　In arid areas or under high cliffs, they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. 　In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. 　Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters. 　Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with mushroom rocks or other types of rock columns remaining. 　Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline. 　The Ordnance Survey distinguishes between around most cliffs (continuous line along the topper edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).

<font size=3>
Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products. 　In a domestic setting, soaps are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping. 　In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts. 　When used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. 　In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. 　It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water. 　Soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base. 　A similar process is used for making detergent which is also created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer. 　Humans have used soap for millennia. 　Evidence exists for the production of soap-like materials in ancient Babylon around 2800 BC.
