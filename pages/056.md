<font size=3>
Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. 　These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry, and analysis, respectively. 　There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline. 　Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. 　These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. 　A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. 　These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration. 　Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. 　Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. 　Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. 　Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications. 　The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks. 　Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. 　Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. 　Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both. 　At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. 　The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(biology)>Tribe (biology)</a> 
<font size=3>
In biology, a tribe is a taxonomic rank above genus, but below family and subfamily. 　It is sometimes subdivided into subtribes. 　By convention, all taxonomic ranks from genus upwards are capitalized, including both tribe and subtribe. 　In zoology, the standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is "-ini". 　Examples include the tribes Caprini (goat-antelopes), Hominini (hominins), Bombini (bumblebees), and Thunnini (tunas). 　The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe Hominina then comprises "humans". 　The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is "-ina". 　In botany, the standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is "-eae". 　Examples include the tribes Acalypheae and Hyacintheae. 　The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae. 　The standard ending for the name of a botanical subtribe is "-inae". 　In bacteriology, the form of tribe names is as in botany, e.g., Pseudomonadeae, based on the genus name Pseudomonas.

<font size=3>
The term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. 　The predominant worldwide usage of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. 　Its definition is contested, in part due to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. 　The concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state. 　These terms are equally disputed. 　In some cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions. 　In the United States, Native American tribes are legally considered to have "domestic dependent nation" status within the territorial United States, with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government.

<font size=3>
A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or man-made features, often considered in terms of their aesthetic appeal. 　A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. 　Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity. 　The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. 　It is the dynamic backdrop to people's lives. 　Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness. 　The Earth has a vast range of landscapes including the icy landscapes of polar regions, mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands, and coastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal forests and tropical rainforests and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions. 　The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as landscaping.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth>Commonwealth</a> 
<font size=3>
A commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. 　Historically, it has been synonymous with "republic". 　The noun "commonwealth", meaning "public welfare, general good or advantage", dates from the 15th century. 　Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common wealth – echoed in the modern synonym "public wealth"), it comes from the old meaning of "wealth", which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica (republic). 　The term literally meant "common well-being". 　In the 17th century, the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "public welfare" or "commonweal" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state". 　The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. 　Three countries – Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica – have the official title "Commonwealth", as do four U.S. states and two U.S. territories. 　Since the early 20th century, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of states, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation primarily of former territories of the British Empire. 　The organisation is not to be confused with the realms of the Commonwealth.

<font size=3>
Manufacturing is the creation or production of goods with the help of equipment, labor, machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. 　It is the essence of the secondary sector of the economy. 　The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from the primary sector are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. 　Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers). 　Manufacturing engineering is the field of engineering that designs and optimizes the manufacturing process, or the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. 　The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification. 　These materials are then modified through manufacturing to become the desired product. 　Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes involved in the production and integration of a product's components. 　Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers, use the term fabrication instead. 　The manufacturing sector is closely connected with the engineering and industrial design industries.

<font size=3>
A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. 　Hats which incorporate mechanical features, such as visors, spikes, flaps, braces or beer holders shade into the broader category of headgear. 　In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. 　In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. 　Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 　Some hats have a protective function. 　As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. 　Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. 　Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs, or the mitre worn by Christian bishops. 　Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the turban worn by Sikhs, or the church hat that is worn as a headcovering by Christian women during prayer and worship.

A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. 　Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. 　Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. 　Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian, and avian features. 　Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

<font size=3>
A hero (feminine: heroine) is a real person or a main fictional character who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or strength. 　Like other formerly gender-specific terms (like actor), hero is often used to refer to any gender, though heroine only refers to women. 　The original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. 　Post-classical and modern heroes, on the other hand, perform great deeds or selfless acts for the common good instead of the classical goal of wealth, pride, and fame. 　The antonym of hero is villain. 　Other terms associated with the concept of hero may include good guy or white hat. 　In classical literature, the hero is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code. 　The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. 　Merriam Webster dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities". 　Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as Gilgamesh, Achilles and Iphigenia, to historical and modern figures, such as Joan of Arc, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Sophie Scholl, Alvin York, Audie Murphy, and Chuck Yeager, and fictional "superheroes", including Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, and Captain America.

<font size=3>
Economics (/ˌɛkəˈnɒmɪks, ˌiːkə-/) is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 　Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. 　Microeconomics analyzes what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. 　Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. 　Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. 　Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing "what is", and normative economics, advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics. 　Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. 　It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing>Fishing</a> 
<font size=3>
Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. 　Fish are often caught as wildlife from the natural environment, but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands and reservoirs. 　Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning. 　The term fishing broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans (shrimp/lobsters/crabs), shellfish, cephalopods (octopus/squid) and echinoderms (starfish/sea urchins). 　The term is not normally applied to harvesting fish raised in controlled cultivations (fish farming). 　Nor is it normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals, where terms like whaling and sealing are used instead. 　Fishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times, and is one of the few food production activities that have persisted from prehistory into modern age, surviving both the Neolithic Revolution and successive Industrial Revolutions. 　In addition to being caught to be eaten for food, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. 　Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept long-term as preserved or living trophies. 　When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released. 　According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. 　Fishing industries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. 　In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms (32 lb), with an additional 7.4 kilograms (16 lb) harvested from fish farms.

The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). 　Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. 　Taste, along with olfaction and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. 　Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas, including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. 　The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste. 　The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. 　Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. 　The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. 　There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. 　Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. 　Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. 　Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami). 　Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.　[citation needed] Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. 　Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. 　Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively. 　The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.　; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and "coolness" (such as of menthol) and "hotness" (pungency), through chemesthesis. 　As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on the body. 　Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons. 　Among humans, taste perception begins to fade at an older age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. 　Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia). 　Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury>Jury</a> 
<font size=3>
A jury is a sworn body of people (jurors) convened to hear evidence and render an impartial verdict (a finding of fact on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. 　Juries developed in England during the Middle Ages and are a hallmark of the English common law system. 　As such, they are used by the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and other countries whose legal systems were derived from the British Empire. 　But most other countries use variations of the European civil law or Islamic sharia law systems, in which juries are not generally used. 　Most trial juries are "petit juries", and usually consist of twelve people. 　Historically, a larger jury known as a grand jury was used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects. 　All common law countries except the United States and Liberia have phased these out. 　The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. 　Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. 　Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a jury in a trial.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay>Gay</a> 
<font size=3>
Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. 　The term originally meant 'carefree', 'cheerful', or 'bright and showy'. 　While scant usage referring to male homosexuality dates to the late 19th century, that meaning became increasingly common by the mid-20th century. 　In modern English, gay has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the community, practices and cultures associated with homosexuality. 　In the 1960s, gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation. 　By the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex, although it is more commonly used to refer specifically to men. 　At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. 　Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to 'rubbish' or 'stupid') to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to 'weak', 'unmanly', or 'lame'). 　The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.　[needs update]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost>Ghost</a> 
<font size=3>
A ghost is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that is believed to be able to appear to the living. 　In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely, from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes to realistic, lifelike forms. 　The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a séance. 　Other terms associated with it are apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter, spirit, spook, wraith, demon, and ghoul. 　The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. 　Certain religious practices—funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. 　Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals other than humans have also been recounted. 　They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life. 　According to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Americans say they have seen a ghost. 　The overwhelming consensus of science is that there is no proof that ghosts exist. 　Their existence is impossible to falsify, and ghost hunting has been classified as pseudoscience. 　Despite centuries of investigation, there is no scientific evidence that any location is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. 　Historically, certain toxic and psychoactive plants (such as datura and hyoscyamus niger), whose use has long been associated with necromancy and the underworld, have been shown to contain anticholinergic compounds that are pharmacologically linked to dementia (specifically DLB) as well as histological patterns of neurodegeneration. 　Recent research has indicated that ghost sightings may be related to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. 　Common prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs (such as sleep aids) may also, in rare instances, cause ghost-like hallucinations, particularly zolpidem and diphenhydramine. 　Older reports linked carbon monoxide poisoning to ghost-like hallucinations. 　In folklore studies, ghosts fall within the motif index designation E200–E599 ("Ghosts and other revenants").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger>Roger</a> 
<font size=3>
Roger is a masculine given name, and a surname. 　The given name is derived from the Old French personal names Roger and Rogier. 　These names are of Germanic origin, derived from the elements hrōd, χrōþi ("fame", "renown", "honour") and gār, gēr ("spear", "lance") (Hrōþigēraz). 　The name was introduced into England by the Normans. 　In Normandy, the Frankish name had been reinforced by the Old Norse cognate Hróðgeirr. 　The name introduced into England replaced the Old English cognate Hroðgar. 　Roger became a very common given name during the Middle Ages. 　A variant form of the given name Roger that is closer to the name's origin is Rodger.
