<font size=3>
A meal is an eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes consumption of food. 　The names used for specific meals in English vary, depending on the speaker's culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. 　Although they can be eaten anywhere, meals typically take place in homes, restaurants, and cafeterias. 　Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. 　Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. 　A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks. 　The type of food that is served or consumed at any given time depends on regional customs. 　Three main meals are often eaten in the morning, early afternoon, and evening in most modern civilizations. 　Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. 　Some serve dinner as the main meal at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper or dinner. 　Except for "breakfast", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.

<font size=3>
Look up strict in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　In mathematical writing, the term strict refers to the property of excluding equality and equivalence and often occurs in the context of inequality and monotonic functions. 　It is often attached to a technical term to indicate that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. 　The opposite is non-strict, which is often understood to be the case but can be put explicitly for clarity. 　In some contexts, the word "proper" can also be used as a mathematical synonym for "strict".

<font size=3>
Voltage, also known as electric pressure, electric tension, or (electric) potential difference, is the difference in electric potential between two points. 　In a static electric field, it corresponds to the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. 　In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage is named volt.　: 166  The voltage between points can be caused by the build-up of electric charge (e.g., a capacitor), and from an electromotive force (e.g., electromagnetic induction in generator, inductors, and transformers). 　On a macroscopic scale, a potential difference can be caused by electrochemical processes (e.g., cells and batteries), the pressure-induced piezoelectric effect, and the thermoelectric effect. 　A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage between two points in a system. 　Often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. 　A voltage can represent either a source of energy or the loss, dissipation, or storage of energy.

<font size=3>
An infection is the invasion of tissues by pathogens, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to the infectious agent and the toxins they produce. 　An infectious disease, also known as a transmissible disease or communicable disease, is an illness resulting from an infection. 　Infections can be caused by a wide range of pathogens, most prominently bacteria and viruses. 　Hosts can fight infections using their immune system. 　Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response, often involving inflammation, followed by an adaptive response. 　Specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, antiprotozoals, and antihelminthics. 　Infectious diseases resulted in 9.2 million deaths in 2013 (about 17% of all deaths). 　The branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature>Curvature</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, curvature is any of several strongly related concepts in geometry. 　Intuitively, the curvature is the amount by which a curve deviates from being a straight line, or a surface deviates from being a plane. 　For curves, the canonical example is that of a circle, which has a curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius. 　Smaller circles bend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. 　The curvature at a point of a differentiable curve is the curvature of its osculating circle, that is the circle that best approximates the curve near this point. 　The curvature of a straight line is zero. 　In contrast to the tangent, which is a vector quantity, the curvature at a point is typically a scalar quantity, that is, it is expressed by a single real number. 　For surfaces (and, more generally for higher-dimensional manifolds), that are embedded in a Euclidean space, the concept of curvature is more complex, as it depends on the choice of a direction on the surface or manifold. 　This leads to the concepts of maximal curvature, minimal curvature, and mean curvature. 　For Riemannian manifolds (of dimension at least two) that are not necessarily embedded in a Euclidean space, one can define the curvature intrinsically, that is without referring to an external space. 　See Curvature of Riemannian manifolds for the definition, which is done in terms of lengths of curves traced on the manifold, and expressed, using linear algebra, by the Riemann curvature tensor.

Amsterdam (/ˈæmstərdæm/ AM-stər-dam, UK also /ˌæmstərˈdæm/ AM-stər-DAM, Dutch: [ˌɑmstərˈdɑm] (listen); lit. 　"The Dam on the River Amstel") is the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands, with The Hague being the seat of government. 　It has a population of 921,402 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan area. 　Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the "Venice of the North", for its large number of canals, now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Amstel River that was dammed to control flooding; the city's name derives from the Amstel dam. 　Originally a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became a major world port during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, when the Netherlands was an economic powerhouse. 　Amsterdam is the leading center for finance and trade, as well as a hub of production of secular art. 　In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. 　The canals of Amsterdam and the 19-20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are both on the UNESCO World Heritage List. 　Sloten, annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century. 　The city has a long tradition of openness, liberalism, and tolerance. 　Cycling is key to the city's modern character, and there are numerous biking paths and lanes spread throughout the entire city. 　Amsterdam's main attractions include its historic canals; the Rijksmuseumcode: nld promoted to code: nl , the state museum with a vast collection of Dutch Golden Age art; the Van Gogh Museum; the Dam Square, where the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and former city hall (stadhuiscode: nld promoted to code: nl ) are located; the Amsterdam Museum; Stedelijk Museum, with modern art; Hermitage Amsterdam, the Concertgebouwcode: nld promoted to code: nl concert hall; the Anne Frank House; the Het Scheepvaartmuseumcode: nld promoted to code: nl , the Heineken Experience, the Natura Artis Magistracode: lat promoted to code: la ; Hortus Botanicus, NEMO, the red-light district and many cannabis coffee shops. 　The city is also well known for its nightlife and festival activity; with several of its nightclubs (Melkwegcode: nld promoted to code: nl , Paradiso) among the world's most famous. 　Primarily known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and narrow canal houses with gabled façades; well-preserved legacies of the city's 17th-century Golden Age, and the establishment of the Van Gogh Museum, displaying the work of the famous Dutch modern artist, have attracted millions of visitors to Amsterdam annually. 　The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered the oldest "modern" securities market stock exchange in the world. 　As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 　The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands. 　Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters in the city, including: the Philips conglomerate, AkzoNobel, Booking.com, TomTom, and ING. Many of the world's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as leading technology companies Uber, Netflix and Tesla. 　In 2022, Amsterdam was ranked the ninth-best city in the world to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. 　The city was ranked 4th place globally as top tech hub in the Savills Tech Cities 2019 report (2nd in Europe), and 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their Innovation Cities Index 2009. 　The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. 　The KLM hub and Amsterdam's main airport, Schiphol, is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, the third busiest in Europe, and the 11th busiest airport in the world. 　The Dutch capital is considered one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with at least 177 nationalities represented. 　Immigration and ethnic segregation in Amsterdam is a current issue. 　A few of Amsterdam's notable residents throughout its history include painters Rembrandt and Vincent van Gogh, seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, and the Holocaust victim and diarist Anne Frank.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga>Manga</a> 

<font size=3>
Manga (Japanese: 漫画 [maŋga]) are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. 　Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art. 　The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. 　Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country. 　In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. 　The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among others. 　Many manga are translated into other languages. 　Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry. 　By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion ($6–7 billion), with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person). 　In 2020 Japan's manga market value hit a new record of ¥612.6 billion due to the fast growth of digital manga sales as well as increase of print sales. 　Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. 　Beginning with the late 2010s manga started massively outselling American comics. 　In 2020 the North American manga market was valued at almost $250 million. 　According to NPD BookScan manga made up 76% of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021. 　The fast growth of the North American manga market has been attributed to manga's wide availability on digital reading apps, book retailer chains such as Barnes & Noble and online retailers such as Amazon as well as the increased streaming of anime. 　According to Jean-Marie Bouissou, manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005. 　This is equivalent to approximately 3 times that of the United States and was valued at about €460 million ($640 million). 　In Europe and the Middle East, the market was valued at $250 million in 2012. 　Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white—due to time constraints, artistic reasons (as coloring could lessen the impact of the artwork) and to keep printing costs low—although some full-color manga exist (e.g., Colorful). 　In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. 　Collected chapters are usually republished in tankōbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively paperback books. 　A manga artist (mangaka in Japanese) typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company. 　If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or during its run. 　Sometimes, manga are based on previous live-action or animated films. 　Manga-influenced comics, among original works, exist in other parts of the world, particularly in those places that speak Chinese ("manhua"), Korean ("manhwa"), English ("OEL manga"), and French ("manfra"), as well as in the nation of Algeria ("DZ-manga").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile>Exile</a> 

<font size=3>
Exile is primarily penal expulsion from one's native country, and secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one's homeland under either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high purpose. 　Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced from their homeland. 　In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. 　Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. 　Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property. 　The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced. 　"Government in exile" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. 　Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit. 　Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

<font size=3>
A garrison (from the French garnison, itself from the verb garnir, "to equip") is any body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it. 　The term now often applies to certain facilities that constitute a military base or fortified military headquarters. 　A garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle, ship, or similar site. 　"Garrison town" is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby. 　"Garrison towns" (Arabic: أمصار, romanized: amsar) were used during the Arab Islamic conquests of Middle Eastern lands by Arab-Muslim armies to increase their dominance over indigenous populations. 　In order to occupy non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the spoils of war. 　The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. 　A secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions in the Arabian Peninsula in order to proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their midst. 　In the United Kingdom, "Garrison" also specifically refers to any of the major military stations such as Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Tidworth, Bulford, and London, which have more than one barracks or camp and their own military headquarters, usually commanded by a colonel, brigadier or major-general, assisted by a garrison sergeant major. 　In Ireland, Association football (as distinct from Gaelic football) has historically been termed the "garrison game" or the "garrison sport" for its connections with British military serving in Irish cities and towns.

<font size=3>
A veteran (from Latin vetus 'old') is a person who has significant experience (and is usually adept and esteemed) and expertise in a particular occupation or field. 　A military veteran is a person who is no longer in a military. 　A military veteran that has served directly in combat in a war is further defined as a war veteran (although not all military conflicts, or areas in which armed combat took place, are necessarily referred to as wars). 　Military veterans are unique as a group as their lived experience is so strongly connected to the conduct of war in general and application of professional violence in particular. 　Therefore, there are a large body of knowledge developed through centuries of scholarly studies that seek to describe, understand and explain their lived experience in and out of service. 　Griffith with colleagues provides an overview of this research field that addresses veterans general health, transition from military service to civilian life, homelessness, veteran employment, civic engagement and veteran identity as recurrent investigative topics in the field.

Brisbane (/ˈbrɪzbən/ (listen) BRIZ-bən) is the capital and most populous city of Queensland, and the third-most populous city in Australia and Oceania with a population of approximately 2.6 million. 　Brisbane lies at the centre of South East Queensland, which includes several other regional centres and cities. 　The central business district is situated within a peninsula of the Brisbane River about 15 km (9 mi) from its mouth at Moreton Bay. 　Brisbane is located in the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges. 　It sprawls across several local government areas, most centrally the City of Brisbane. 　The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite. 　The Aboriginal traditional owners of Meanjin include the Yugara, Turrbal and Quandamooka peoples. 　Brisbane occupies the land of a number of Aboriginal language groups, primarily the Yugara language group which includes the Turrbal language. 　The Moreton Bay penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney colony, and soon moved to North Quay in 1825 on the banks of the Brisbane River, so named for Sir Thomas Brisbane. 　German Lutherans established the first free settlement of Zion Hill at Nundah in 1838, and in 1859 Brisbane was chosen as Queensland's capital when the state separated from New South Wales. 　By the late 19th century, the city had grown into a major port and centre of immigration. 　During World War II, the Allied command in the South West Pacific was based in the city, along with the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur of the United States Army. 　Brisbane is classified as a global city, and is a major centre of research and innovation in the Asia-Pacific, particularly in medicine and biotechnology. 　A transport hub, Brisbane is served by large rail, bus and ferry networks, as well as Brisbane Airport and the Port of Brisbane, Australia's third-largest seaport. 　A diverse city with over 32% of its metropolitan population being foreign-born, Brisbane is frequently ranked highly in lists of the most liveable cities. 　Galleries and museums are an important part of the city's culture, with the most prominent being the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art. 　Brisbane has hosted major events including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo 88, the 2014 G20 summit, and will host the 2032 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. 　Brisbane is a popular tourist destination. 　Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the City Botanic Gardens, King George Square and City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens and Lookout and the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting>Conducting</a> 

<font size=3>
Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. 　It has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture." 　The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score in a way that reflects the specific indications in that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by ensemble members, and "shape" the phrasing where appropriate. 　Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, usually with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals such as facial expression and eye contact. 　A conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions to their musicians in rehearsal. 　The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices. 　Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. 　In Baroque music, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. 　Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. 　Communication is typically mostly non-verbal during a performance. 　However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung. 　Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. 　They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (such as in tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. 　They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. 　Orchestras, choirs, concert bands, and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff>Cliff</a> 

<font size=3>
In geography and geology, a cliff is an area of rock which has a general angle defined by the vertical, or nearly vertical. 　Cliffs are formed by the processes of weathering and erosion, with the effect of gravity. 　Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. 　Cliffs are usually composed of rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. 　The sedimentary rocks that are most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. 　Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs. 　An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff formed by the movement of a geologic fault, a landslide, or sometimes by rock slides or falling rocks which change the differential erosion of the rock layers. 　Most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base. 　In arid areas or under high cliffs, they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. 　In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. 　Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters. 　Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with mushroom rocks or other types of rock columns remaining. 　Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline. 　The Ordnance Survey distinguishes between around most cliffs (continuous line along the topper edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).

<font size=3>
Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products. 　In a domestic setting, soaps are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping. 　In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts. 　When used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. 　In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. 　It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water. 　Soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base. 　A similar process is used for making detergent which is also created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer. 　Humans have used soap for millennia. 　Evidence exists for the production of soap-like materials in ancient Babylon around 2800 BC.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing>Boxing</a> 

<font size=3>
Boxing (also known as "Western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. 　Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to "western boxing", in which only the fists are involved, boxing has developed in various ways in different geographical areas and cultures. 　In global terms, boxing is a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. 　Some of the forms of the modern sport are western boxing, bare knuckle boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and sanda. 　Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports. 　Humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, Boxing have prehistoric origins in present-day Ethiopia where it appeared in the sixth millennium BC and when the Egyptians invaded Nubia they learned the art of boxing from the local population and they took the sport to Egypt where it became popular and from Egypt boxing spread to other countries including Greece, and eastward to Mesopotamia and northward to Rome. 　The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing is from Egypt and Sumer both from the third millennia and can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the third and second millennia BC. 　The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC. 　Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules. 　Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games — it also has its own world championships. 　Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called "rounds". 　A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies an opponent, or the opponent resigns. 　When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. 　In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a professional bout is considered a draw. 　In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.

Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ BAR-sə-LOH-nə, Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə], Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona]) is a city on the coast of northeastern Spain. 　It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. 　With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. 　It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high. 　Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. 　After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. 　Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. 　Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. 　The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. 　The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport tournaments. 　Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. 　As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +). 　Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentary_(philology)>Commentary (philology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In philology, a commentary is a line-by-line or even word-by-word explication usually attached to an edition of a text in the same or an accompanying volume. 　It may draw on methodologies of close reading and literary criticism, but its primary purpose is to elucidate the language of the text and the specific culture that produced it, both of which may be foreign to the reader. 　Such a commentary usually takes the form of footnotes, endnotes, or separate text cross-referenced by line, paragraph or page. 　Means of providing commentary on the language of the text include notes on textual criticism, syntax and semantics, and the analysis of rhetoric, literary tropes, and style. 　The aim is to remove, lessen or point out linguistic obstacles to reading and understanding the text. 　If a text is historical, or is produced within a culture assumed to be of limited familiarity to a reader, a broader range of issues may require elucidation. 　These include, but are by no means limited to, biographical data pertaining to the author, historical events, customs and laws, technical terminology and facts of daily life, religious beliefs and philosophical perspectives, literary allusions, geographical settings, and cross-references to related passages in the same work, other works by the author, or sources used by the author. 　Some commentaries from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages (more strictly referred to as scholia) are a valuable source of information otherwise unknown, including references to works that are now lost. 　Jerome provides a list of several commentaries that were in use during his days as a student in the 350s A.D. One of the most used of the ancient scholia today is that of Servius on Vergil’s Aeneid, written in the 4th century. 　The production of commentaries began to flourish in the 16th century as part of the humanist project to recover the texts of antiquity, with its related boom in publishing. 　In the modern era, a commentary differs from an annotated edition aimed at students or the casual reader in that it attempts to address an exhaustive range of scholarly questions, many of which may be of concern or interest primarily to specialists. 　The commentator may take a position on variant readings of the text or on a point of scholarly dispute, but arguments are usually succinct, a paragraph or less than a page in length.

<font size=3>
In ecology, local abundance is the relative representation of a species in a particular ecosystem. 　It is usually measured as the number of individuals found per sample. 　The ratio of abundance of one species to one or multiple other species living in an ecosystem is referred to as relative species abundances. 　Both indicators are relevant for computing biodiversity. 　A variety of sampling methods are used to measure abundance. 　For larger animals, these may include spotlight counts, track counts and roadkill counts, as well as presence at monitoring stations. 　In many plant communities the abundances of plant species are measured by plant cover, i.e. the relative area covered by different plant species in a small plot. 　Abundance is in simplest terms usually measured by identifying and counting every individual of every species in a given sector. 　It is common for the distribution of species to be skewed so that a few species take up the bulk of individuals collected. 　Relative species abundance is calculated by dividing the number of species from one group by the total number of species from all groups.

<font size=3>
Auckland (pronounced /ˈɔːk.lənd/) (Māori: Tāmaki Makaurau) is a large metropolitan city in the North Island of New Zealand. 　The most populous urban area in the country and the fifth largest city in Oceania, Auckland has an urban population of about 1,440,300 (June 2022). 　It is located in the greater Auckland Region—the area governed by Auckland Council—which includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, and which has a total population of 1,695,200. 　While Europeans continue to make up the plurality of Auckland's population, the city became multicultural and cosmopolitan in the late-20th century, with Asians accounting for 31% of the city's population in 2018. 　Auckland has the eighth largest proportion of foreign born residents in the world, with 41% of its residents born overseas. 　With its large population of Pasifika New Zealanders, the city is also home to the biggest ethnic Polynesian population in the world. 　The Māori-language name for Auckland is Tāmaki Makaurau, meaning "Tāmaki desired by many", in reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography. 　Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf to the east, the Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the Waitākere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. 　The surrounding hills are covered in rainforest and the landscape is dotted with 53 volcanic centres that make up the Auckland Volcanic Field. 　The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitematā Harbour on the Pacific Ocean. 　Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water. 　The Auckland isthmus was first settled c. 　1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land. 　The Māori population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans. 　After a British colony was established in New Zealand in 1840, William Hobson, then Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, chose Auckland as its new capital. 　He named the area after George Eden, Earl of Auckland, British First Lord of the Admiralty. 　Māori–European conflict over land in the region led to war in the mid-19th century. 　In 1865, Auckland was replaced by Wellington as the capital, but continued to grow, initially because of its port and the logging and gold-mining activities in its hinterland, and later because of pastoral farming (especially dairy farming) in the surrounding area, and manufacturing in the city itself. 　It has been the nation's largest city throughout most of its history. 　Today, Auckland's central business district is New Zealand's leading economic hub. 　It also has a thriving culture that has influenced others across the world, built on its dynamic arts scene and a richly multicultural history. 　The University of Auckland, founded in 1883, is the largest university in New Zealand. 　The city's significant tourist attractions include national historic sites, festivals, performing arts, sports activities, and a variety of cultural institutions, such as the Auckland War Memorial Museum, the Museum of Transport and Technology, and the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki. 　Its architectural landmarks include the Harbour Bridge, the Town Hall, the Ferry Building and the Sky Tower, which is the second tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere after Thamrin Nine. 　The city is served by Auckland Airport, which handles around 2 million international passengers a month. 　Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, Auckland is recognised as one of the world's most liveable cities, ranking third in the 2019 Mercer Quality of Living Survey and at first place in a 2021 ranking of the Global Liveability Ranking by The Economist.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop>Workshop</a> 

<font size=3>
Beginning with the Industrial Revolution era, a workshop may be a room, rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods. 　Workshops were the only places of production until the advent of industrialization and the development of larger factories. 　In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contained a workshop in either the garage, basement, or an external shed. 　Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools, and other hardware. 　Along with the practical application of repairing goods, workshops are often used to tinker and make prototypes. 　Some workshops focus exclusively on automotive repair or restoration although there are a variety of workshops in existence today. 　Woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and other types of electronic prototyping workshops are among the most common.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift>Redshift</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). 　The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. 　The terms derive from the colours red and blue which form the extremes of the visible light spectrum. 　In astronomy and cosmology, the three main causes of electromagnetic redshift are The radiation travels between objects which are moving apart ("relativistic" redshift, an example of the relativistic Doppler effect) The radiation travels towards an object in a weaker gravitational potential, i.e. towards an object in less strongly curved (flatter) spacetime (gravitational redshift) The radiation travels through expanding space (cosmological redshift). 　The observation that all sufficiently distant light sources show redshift corresponding to their distance from Earth is known as Hubble's law. 　Relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. 　Gravitational waves, which also travel at the speed of light, are subject to the same redshift phenomena. 　Examples of strong redshifting are a gamma ray perceived as an X-ray, or initially visible light perceived as radio waves. 　Subtler redshifts are seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects, and are used in terrestrial technologies such as Doppler radar and radar guns. 　Other physical processes exist that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from (astronomical) redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer). 　The value of a redshift is often denoted by the letter z, corresponding to the fractional change in wavelength (positive for redshifts, negative for blueshifts), and by the wavelength ratio 1 + z (which is >1 for redshifts, <1 for blueshifts).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect>Suspect</a> 

<font size=3>
In law enforcement jargon, a suspect is a known person accused or suspected of committing a crime. 　Police and reporters in the United States often use the word suspect as a jargon when referring to the perpetrator of the offense (perp in dated U.S. slang). 　However, in official definition, the perpetrator is the robber, assailant, counterfeiter, etc.　—the person who committed the crime. 　The distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not known to have committed the offense, while the perpetrator—who may not yet have been suspected of the crime, and is thus not necessarily a suspect—is the one who did. 　The suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator, or there may have been no actual crime, which would mean there is no perpetrator. 　A common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a mug shot is of a suspect). 　Frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect, when there is no suspect; the police could be looking for a suspect, but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not. 　Possibly because of the misuse of "suspect" to mean "perpetrator", police in the late 20th and early 21st century began to use person of interest, possible suspect, and even possible person of interest, to mean suspect.　[citation needed] Under the judicial systems of the U.S., once a decision is approved to arrest a suspect, or bind him over for trial, either by a prosecutor issuing an information, a grand jury issuing a true bill or indictment, or a judge issuing an arrest warrant, the suspect can then be properly called a defendant, or the accused. 　Only after being convicted is the suspect properly called the perpetrator.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realm_(virology)>Realm (virology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In virology, realm is the highest taxonomic rank established for viruses by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which oversees virus taxonomy. 　Six virus realms are recognized and united by specific highly conserved traits: Adnaviria, which contains archaeal filamentous viruses with A-form double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes encoding a unique alpha-helical major capsid protein; Duplodnaviria, which contains all dsDNA viruses that encode the HK97-fold major capsid protein; Monodnaviria, which contains all single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that encode a HUH superfamily endonuclease and their descendants; Riboviria, which contains all RNA viruses that encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and all viruses that encode reverse transcriptase; Ribozyviria, which contains hepatitis delta-like viruses with circular, negative-sense ssRNA genomes; and Varidnaviria, which contains all dsDNA viruses that encode a vertical jelly roll major capsid protein. 　The rank of realm corresponds to the rank of domain used for cellular life, but differs in that viruses in a realm do not necessarily share a common ancestor based on common descent nor do the realms share a common ancestor. 　Instead, realms group viruses together based on specific traits that are highly conserved over time, which may have been obtained on a single occasion or multiple occasions. 　As such, each realm represents at least one instance of viruses coming into existence. 　While historically it was difficult to determine deep evolutionary relations between viruses, in the 21st century methods such as metagenomics and cryogenic electron microscopy have enabled such research to occur, which led to the establishment of Riboviria in 2018, three realms in 2019, and two in 2020.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce>Divorce</a> 

<font size=3>
Divorce (also known as dissolution of marriage) is the process of terminating a marriage or marital union. 　Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state. 　Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries, divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property, child custody, alimony (spousal support), child visitation / access, parenting time, child support, and division of debt. 　In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person. 　Divorce is different from annulment, which declares the marriage null and void, with legal separation or de jure separation (a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a de facto separation while remaining legally married) or with de facto separation (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting). 　Reasons for divorce vary, from sexual incompatibility or lack of independence for one or both spouses to a personality clash or infidelity. 　The only countries that do not allow divorce are the Philippines and the Vatican City. 　In the Philippines, divorce for non-Muslim Filipinos is not legal unless the husband or wife is an undocumented immigrant and satisfies certain conditions. 　The Vatican City is a state ruled by the head of the Catholic Church, a religion that does not allow for divorce. 　Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975, although from 1910 to 1940 it was possible both for the civil and religious marriage), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991; from 1976 was allowed only for non-Catholics), Andorra (1995), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle>Beetle</a> 

<font size=3>
Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera (/koʊliːˈɒptərə/), in the superorder Endopterygota. 　Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. 　The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 described species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently, with estimates suggesting that there are between 0.9 and 2.1 million total species. 　Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions, they interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. 　Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops. 　Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. 　The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. 　Beetles are endopterygotes, which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. 　Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. 　Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colors and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. 　Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage. 　Beetles are prominent in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. 　Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively colored making them objects of collection and decorative displays. 　Over 300 species are used as food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. 　However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. 　Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. 　Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse>Mouse</a> 

<font size=3>
A mouse (PL: mice) is a small rodent. 　Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. 　The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). 　Mice are also popular as pets. 　In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. 　They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. 　Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. 　Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger. 　The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. 　Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus, but the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus. 　Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. 　This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. 　The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. 　It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. 　Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. 　Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. 　Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today. 　In certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin. 　Vermin are a major source of crop damage, as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease. 　Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites. 　In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). 　Primarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing. 　They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators. 　In the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows. 　These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels. 　In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.

<font size=3>
A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. 　It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. 　A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. 　Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one. 　In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. 　A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation 'prototypical'. 　This is a useful term in identifying objects, behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes. 　The word prototype derives from the Greek πρωτότυπον prototypon, "primitive form", neutral of πρωτότυπος prototypos, "original, primitive", from πρῶτος protos, "first" and τύπος typos, "impression" (originally in the sense of a mark left by a blow, then by a stamp struck by a die (note "typewriter"); by implication a scar or mark; by analogy a shape i.e. a statue, (figuratively) style, or resemblance; a model for imitation or illustrative example—note "typical").

<font size=3>
Cincinnati (/ˌsɪnsɪˈnæti/ SIN-si-NAT-ee) is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Hamilton County. 　Settled in 1788, the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers, the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky. 　The city is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. 　With an estimated population of 2,256,884, it is Ohio's largest metropolitan area and the nation's 30th-largest, and with a city population of 309,317, Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 64th in the United States. 　Throughout much of the 19th century, it was among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by New Orleans and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the sixth-most populous city from 1840 until 1860. 　As a rivertown crossroads at the junction of the North, South, East, and West, Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. 　However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions. 　By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. 　The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly Chicago, which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and St. Louis, which for decades after the Civil War served as the gateway to westward migration. 　Cincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball; the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League; and FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer; it is also home to the Cincinnati Cyclones, a minor league ice hockey team. 　The city's largest institution of higher education, the University of Cincinnati, was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States. 　Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years. 　In the late 1800s, Cincinnati was commonly referred to as the "Paris of America", due mainly to such ambitious architectural projects as the Music Hall, Cincinnatian Hotel, and Shillito Department Store. 　Cincinnati is the birthplace of William Howard Taft, the 27th President and former Chief Justice of the United States.

<font size=3>
In mathematics, set A is a subset of a set B if all elements of A are also elements of B; B is then a superset of A. It is possible for A and B to be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion (or sometimes containment). 　A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes (or contains) A or A is included (or contained) in B. A k-subset is a subset with k elements. 　The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. 　In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.

Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life. 　Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. 　Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority. 　Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare environments; but there is evidence of international shortages of qualified nurses. 　Nurses collaborate with other healthcare providers such as physicians, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and psychologists. 　Unlike nurse practitioners, nurses typically can not prescribe medications in the US. 　Nurse practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing. 　They practice independently in a variety of settings in more than half of the United States. 　Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing. 　Nurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family, and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life. 　In the United Kingdom and the United States, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe the correct medications and other therapies, depending on particular state regulations. 　Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners, and dietitians. 　Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals. 　In addition to providing care and support, nurses educate the public, and promote health and wellness.

<font size=3>
A bullet is a kinetic projectile, a component of firearm ammunition that is shot from a gun barrel. 　They are made of a variety of materials, such as copper, lead, steel, polymer, rubber and even wax; and are made in various shapes and constructions (depending on the intended applications), including specialized functions such as hunting, target shooting, training and combat. 　Bullets are often tapered, making them more aerodynamic. 　Bullet size is expressed by weight and diameter (referred to as "caliber") in both imperial and metric measurement systems. 　Bullets do not normally contain explosives but strike or damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya>Kenya</a> 

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 1°N 38°E﻿ / ﻿1°N 38°E﻿ / 1; 38 Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Kenya), is a country in East Africa. 　At 580,367 square kilometres (224,081 sq mi), Kenya is the world's 48th largest country by area. 　With a population of more than 47.6 million in the 2019 census, Kenya is the 27th most populous country in the world. 　Kenya's capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest, currently second largest city, and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa. 　Kisumu City is the third-largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria. 　Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret. 　As of 2020, Kenya is the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. 　Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, Ethiopia to the north, Somalia to the east, Uganda to the west, Tanzania to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. 　Its geography, climate and population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped mountaintops (Batian, Nelion and Point Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates in western and rift valley counties and dry less fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts (Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert). 　Kenya's earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, like the present-day Hadza people. 　According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, Cushitic speakers first settled in Kenya's lowlands between 3,200 and 1,300 BC, a phase known as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. 　Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) began migrating from present-day South Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC. 　Bantu people settled at the coast and the interior between 250 BC and 500 AD. 　European contact began in 1500 AD with the Portuguese Empire, and effective colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior. 　Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in 1920. 　Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution, which began in 1952, and the declaration of independence in 1963. 　After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. 　The current constitution was adopted in 2010 and replaced the 1963 independence constitution. 　Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic, in which elected officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and government. 　Kenya is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, COMESA, International Criminal Court, as well as other international organisations. 　With a GNI of 1,840, Kenya is a lower-middle-income economy. 　Kenya's economy is the largest in eastern and central Africa, with Nairobi serving as a major regional commercial hub. 　Agriculture is the largest sector: tea and coffee are traditional cash crops, while fresh flowers are a fast-growing export. 　The service industry is also a major economic driver, particularly tourism. 　Kenya is a member of the East African Community trade bloc, though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the Greater Horn of Africa. 　Africa is Kenya's largest export market, followed by the European Union.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision>Collision</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, a collision is any event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other in a relatively short time. 　Although the most common use of the word collision refers to incidents in which two or more objects collide with great force, the scientific use of the term implies nothing about the magnitude of the force. 　Some examples of physical interactions that scientists would consider collisions are the following: When an insect lands on a plant's leaf, its legs are said to collide with the leaf. 　When a cat strides across a lawn, each contact that its paws make with the ground is considered a collision, as well as each brush of its fur against a blade of grass. 　When a boxer throws a punch, their fist is said to collide with the opponents body. 　When an astronomical object merges with a black hole, they are considered to collide. 　Some colloquial uses of the word collision are the following: A traffic collision involves at least one automobile. 　A mid-air collision occurs between airplanes. 　A ship collision accurately involves at least two moving maritime vessels hitting each other; the related term, allision, describes when a moving ship strikes a stationary object (often, but not always, another ship). 　In physics, collisions can be classified by the change in the total kinetic energy of the system before and after the collision: If most or all of the total kinetic energy is lost (dissipated as heat, sound, etc. or absorbed by the objects themselves), the collision is said to be inelastic; such collisions involve objects coming to a full stop. 　An example of such a collision is a car crash, as cars crumple inward when crashing, rather than bouncing off of each other. 　This is by design, for the safety of the occupants and bystanders should a crash occur - the frame of the car absorbs the energy of the crash instead. 　If most of the kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. the objects continue moving afterwards), the collision is said to be elastic. 　An example of this is a baseball bat hitting a baseball - the kinetic energy of the bat is transferred to the ball, greatly increasing the ball's velocity. 　The sound of the bat hitting the ball represents the loss of energy. 　And if all of the total kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. no energy is released as sound, heat, etc.), the collision is said to be perfectly elastic. 　Such a system is an idealization and cannot occur in reality, due to the second law of thermodynamics.

<font size=3>
Citizenship is an allegiance of person to a state. 　Each state determines the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. 　Recognition by a state as a citizen generally carries with it recognition of civil, political, and social rights which are not afforded to non-citizens. 　In general, the basic rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country, and to work there. 　Some countries permit their citizens to have multiple citizenships, while others insist on exclusive allegiance.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing>Sailing</a> 

<font size=3>
Sailing craft and their rigs Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, raft, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation. 　From prehistory until the second half of the 19th century, sailing craft were the primary means of maritime trade and transportation; exploration across the seas and oceans was reliant on sail for anything other than the shortest distances. 　Naval power in this period used sail to varying degrees depending on the current technology, culminating in the gun-armed sailing warships of the Age of Sail. 　Sail was slowly replaced by steam as the method of propulsion for ships over the latter part of the 19th century – seeing a gradual improvement in the technology of steam through a number of stepwise developments. 　Steam allowed scheduled services that ran at higher average speeds than sailing vessels. 　Large improvements in fuel economy allowed steam to progressively outcompete sail in, ultimately, all commercial situations, giving ship-owning investors a better return on capital.　: 9, 16  In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport. 　Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising. 　Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing. 　Sailing relies on the physics of sails as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. 　On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the apparent wind, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. 　The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft which are steering the course. 　This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. 　The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a point of sail. 　Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial>Editorial</a> 

<font size=3>
An editorial, or leading article (UK) or leader (UK) is an article written by the senior editorial people or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned. 　Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Boston Globe, often classify editorials under the heading "opinion". 　Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons. 　Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on. 　Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name think pieces) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. 　However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. 　In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France. 　Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. 　Tom Clark, leader-writer for The Guardian, says that it ensures readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author. 　On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. 　Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility. 　In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.

Ruins (from Latin ruina 'a collapse') are the remains of a civilization's architecture. 　The term refers to formerly intact structures that have fallen into a state of partial or total disrepair over time due to a variety of factors, such as lack of maintenance, deliberate destruction by humans, or uncontrollable destruction by natural phenomena. 　The most common root causes that yield ruins in their wake are natural disasters, armed conflict, and population decline, with many structures becoming progressively derelict over time due to long-term weathering and scavenging. 　There are famous ruins all over the world, with notable sites originating from ancient China, the Indus Valley and other regions of ancient India, ancient Iran, ancient Israel and Judea, ancient Iraq, ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, Roman sites throughout the Mediterranean Basin, and Incan and Mayan sites in the Americas. 　Ruins are of great importance to historians, archaeologists and anthropologists, whether they were once individual fortifications, places of worship, ancient universities, houses and utility buildings, or entire villages, towns, and cities. 　Many ruins have become UNESCO World Heritage Sites in recent years, to identify and preserve them as areas of outstanding value to humanity.

Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/; Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formally the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a landlocked country in South Asia. 　It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. 　Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. 　Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. 　Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. 　The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. 　In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. 　Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. 　The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. 　The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. 　The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. 　By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. 　The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. 　The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. 　Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. 　The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy. 　The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. 　Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. 　Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. 　Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. 　The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.

<font size=3>
In geology, basement and crystalline basement are crystalline rocks lying above the mantle and beneath all other rocks and sediments. 　They are sometimes exposed at the surface, but often they are buried under miles of rock and sediment. 　The basement rocks lie below a sedimentary platform or cover, or more generally any rock below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. 　In the same way, the sediments or sedimentary rocks on top of the basement can be called a "cover" or "sedimentary cover". 　Crustal rocks are modified several times before they become basement, and these transitions alter their composition.

A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are completely or partly below the ground floor. 　It generally is used as a utility space for a building, where such items as the furnace, water heater, breaker panel or fuse box, car park, and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical system and cable television distribution point. 　In cities with high property prices, such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space. 　In British English, the word basement is usually used for underground floors of, for example, department stores. 　The word is usually used with houses when the space below the ground floor is habitable, with windows and (usually) its own access. 　The word cellar applies to the whole underground level or to any large underground room. 　A subcellar or subbasement is a cellar that lies further underneath.

In geology, a suite is a lithodemic unit consisting of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class (metamorphic, igneous or sedimentary). 　The law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. 　Such bodies of rock are described as lithodemic and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. 　The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal term lithodeme, which is comparable to a formation. 　A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. 　A suite is a group of two or more lithodemes of a single genetic class. 　It differs from a complex, which is a group of two or more lithodemes of different genetic classes.

<font size=3>
In pencil and paper games and computer and video games, an item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character. 　These items are sometimes called pick-ups. 　Items are most often beneficial to the player character. 　Some games contain detrimental items, such as cursed pieces of armor that confers a negative bonus to the wearer and cannot be removed until the curse itself is lifted; the means to do this may be costly or require a special item. 　Some items may also be of absolutely no value to the player. 　Items are especially prevalent in role-playing games, as they are usually necessary for the completion of quests or to advance through the story. 　Sometimes certain items may be unique, and only appear once at a specific location, often after completing a particular task. 　Other items may appear frequently, and not give a big bonus alone, but when many are collected. 　Games may differ on how the player uses an item. 　Some games, many in the Mario and Sonic series, an item is automatically used when the player character comes into contact with it. 　There are also games, such as those in the Streets of Rage series, and the first Prince of Persia games where the player character may walk over an item without collecting it, if they do not need it yet, and the player must push a particular button for the character to collect it, but it still used immediately, when the button is pressed. 　Other times, some games, like many role playing games, an item can be collected either automatically or manually, but will not be used immediately, the item can be carried around and used manually either straight away if they wish or at a later time when the player needs it.

<font size=3>
A missionary is a member of a religious group which is sent into an area in order to promote its faith or provide services to people, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development. 　In the Latin translation of the Bible, Jesus Christ says the word when he sends the disciples into areas and commands them to preach the gospel in his name. 　The term is most commonly used in reference to Christian missions, but it can also be used in reference to any creed or ideology. 　The word mission originated in 1598 when Jesuits, the members of the Society of Jesus sent members abroad, derived from the Latin missionem (nom. missio), meaning 'act of sending' or mittere, meaning 'to send'.

<font size=3>
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. 　Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents. 　Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. 　Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation). 　Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_(theology)>Adoption (theology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Adoption, in Christian theology, is the reception of a believer into the family of God. 　In the Reformed ordo salutis ("order of salvation"), adoption is usually regarded as a step immediately subsequent to justification. 　As a theological word, adoption has similar connotations to the act of parents who legally take responsibility for a child who was not originally born to them. 　There are three references in the New Testament to God "adopting" ('υιοθεσια) Christians as his own children (Galatians 4:5, Romans 8:15 and Ephesians 1:5) and one reference to God adopting "people of Israel" (Romans 9:4). 　Adoption as a theological term introduces a relational dimension to the consequences of salvation. 　Adoption as a theological concept is also another consequence of the 'legal' act of justification, alongside redemption and reconciliation. 　The Old Testament precedent for this term comes from the story of Mephibosheth, who despite not being part of Davidic family was included in the Royal inheritance (2 Samuel 9:7-13). 　Adoption is an important feature of Reformation theology as demonstrated by article 12 of the Westminster Confession of Faith: All those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God.

<font size=3>
Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or other parts of the body to ascend a steep topographical object that can range from the world's tallest mountains (e.g. the eight thousanders) to small boulders. 　Climbing is done for locomotion, for sporting recreation, for competition, and is also done in trades that rely on ascension; such as rescue and military operations. 　Climbing is done indoors and outdoors, on natural surfaces (e.g. rock climbing and ice climbing), and on artificial surfaces (e.g. climbing walls). 　Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides (e.g. the UIAGM), were a significant element in developing the popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and remain so today. 　Since the 1980s, the development of competition climbing and the availability of artificial climbing walls have dramatically increased the popularity of rock climbing as a sport, and led to the emergence of professional rock climbers, such as Wolfgang Güllich, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, Lynn Hill, Catherine Destivelle, and Janja Garnbret. 　Climbing became an Olympic sport for the first time in the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo (see Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics) for sport climbing and speed climbing disciplines.

<font size=3>
A tributary, or affluent, is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. 　A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. 　Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. 　The Irtysh is a chief tributary of the Ob river and is also the longest tributary river in the world with a length of 4,248 km (2,640 mi). 　The Madeira River is the largest tributary river by volume in the world with an average discharge of 31,200 m3/s (1.1 million cu ft/s). 　A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet, usually refers to the joining of tributaries. 　The opposite to a tributary is a distributary, a river or stream that branches off from and flows away from the main stream. 　Distributaries are most often found in river deltas.

<font size=3>
Nebraska (/nəˈbræskə/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. 　It is bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. 　It is the only triply landlocked U.S. state. 　Indigenous peoples, including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before European exploration. 　The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 　Nebraska's area is just over 77,220 square miles (200,000 km2) with a population of over 1.9 million. 　Its capital is Lincoln, and its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. 　Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the American Civil War. 　The Nebraska Legislature is unlike any other American legislature in that it is unicameral, and its members are elected without any official reference to political party affiliation. 　Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. 　The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. 　The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized by treeless prairie. 　Nebraska has two major climatic zones. 　The eastern two-thirds of the state has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa); a unique warmer subtype considered "warm-temperate" exists near the southern plains, which is analogous to that in Kansas and Oklahoma, which have a predominantly humid subtropical climate. 　The Panhandle and adjacent areas bordering Colorado have a primarily semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). 　The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures, variations that decrease moving south within the state. 　Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer and sometimes in autumn. 　Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.

<font size=3>
An elevator or lift is a machine that vertically transports people or freight between levels. 　They are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack. 　In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. 　Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators. 　Languages other than English, such as Japanese, may refer to elevators by loanwords based on either elevator or lift. 　Due to wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps are not possible. 　High-speed elevators are elevators that move faster than regular elevators and are common in skyscrapers and towers. 　Some elevators can also travel horizontally in addition to the usual vertical motion.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses>Moses</a> 

<font size=3>
Moses (/ˈmoʊzɪz, -zɪs/) is considered the most important prophet in Judaism and one of the most important prophets in Christianity, Islam, the Druze faith, the Baháʼí Faith and other Abrahamic religions. 　According to both the Bible and the Quran, Moses was the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver to whom the authorship, or "acquisition from heaven", of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible) is attributed. 　According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in population and, as a result, the Egyptian Pharaoh worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. 　Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. 　Through Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. 　After killing an Egyptian slave-master who was beating a Hebrew, Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered the Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb, which he regarded as the Mountain of God. 　God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. 　Moses said that he could not speak eloquently, so God allowed Aaron, his elder brother, to become his spokesperson. 　After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. 　After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died on Mount Nebo at the age of 120, within sight of the Promised Land. 　Generally, scholars see Moses as a legendary figure, whilst retaining the possibility that Moses or a Moses-like figure existed in the 13th century BCE. 　Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE; Jerome suggested 1592 BCE, and James Ussher suggested 1571 BCE as his birth year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference>Inference</a> 

<font size=3>
Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". 　Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). 　Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. 　Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. 　A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, contradistinguishing abduction from induction. 　Various fields study how inference is done in practice. 　Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. 　Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. 　This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. 　Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. 　Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 　A male that has been castrated is a capon. 　An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. 　Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. 　Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. 　The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers. 　Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update], up from more than 19 billion in 2011. 　There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. 　There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.　[citation needed] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. 　From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. 　They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. 　They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.

<font size=3>
A lecture (from Latin lēctūra “reading” ) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. 　Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. 　A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. 　Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content. 　Though lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses. 　Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning. 　Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. 　Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study. 　Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. 　Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "keynote addresses", i.e., lectures. 　The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. 　Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. 　Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. 　Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. 　Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome>Syndrome</a> 

<font size=3>
A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms which are correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder. 　The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον, meaning "concurrence".　: 1818  When a syndrome is paired with a definite cause this becomes a disease. 　In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them. 　This substitution of terminology often confuses the reality and meaning of medical diagnoses. 　This is especially true of inherited syndromes. 　About one third of all phenotypes that are listed in OMIM are described as dysmorphic, which usually refers to the facial gestalt. 　For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature. 　In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. 　For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms. 　If an underlying genetic cause is suspected but not known, a condition may be referred to as a genetic association (often just "association" in context). 　By definition, an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.　: 167  Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture. 　Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms. 　Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively (by symptoms or underlying cause) rather than eponymously, but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage. 　The defining of syndromes has sometimes been termed syndromology, but it is usually not a separate discipline from nosology and differential diagnosis generally, which inherently involve pattern recognition (both sentient and automated) and differentiation among overlapping sets of signs and symptoms. 　Teratology (dysmorphology) by its nature involves the defining of congenital syndromes that may include birth defects (pathoanatomy), dysmetabolism (pathophysiology), and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi>Rabbi</a> 

<font size=3>
A rabbi (/ˈræbaɪ/) is a spiritual leader or religious teacher in Judaism. 　One becomes a rabbi by being ordained by another rabbi – known as semikha – following a course of study of Jewish history and texts such as the Talmud. 　The basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic (167 BCE–73 CE) and Talmudic (70–640 CE) eras, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. 　The title "rabbi" was first used in the first century CE. 　In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister, hence the title "pulpit rabbis", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. 　Within the various Jewish denominations, there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is recognized as a rabbi. 　For example, only a minority of Orthodox Jewish communities accept the ordination of women rabbis. 　Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons (Conservative Judaism) as well as ethical reasons (Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism).

Holland is a geographical region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. 　From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the counts of Holland. 　By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic. 　The area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the capital city (Amsterdam), the home of Europe's largest port (Rotterdam), and the seat of government (The Hague). 　Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019, and a population density of 1203/km2. 　The name Holland has frequently been used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. 　This casual usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and is even employed by many Dutch themselves. 　However, some in the Netherlands (particularly those from regions outside Holland or the west) find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country. 　In January 2020, the Netherlands officially dropped its support of the word Holland for the whole country, which included a logo redesign that changed "Holland" to "NL".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder>Cylinder</a> 

<font size=3>
A cylinder (from Greek: κύλινδρος, romanized: kulindros, lit. 'roller', 'tumbler') has traditionally been a three-dimensional solid, one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes. 　In elementary geometry, it is considered a prism with a circle as its base. 　A cylinder may also be defined as an infinite curvilinear surface in various modern branches of geometry and topology. 　The shift in the basic meaning—solid versus surface (as in ball and sphere)—has created some ambiguity with terminology. 　The two concepts may be distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces. 　In the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the right circular cylinder.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization>Generalization</a> 

<font size=3>
Look up generalization in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A generalization is a form of abstraction whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. 　Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). 　As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation. 　Generalization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. 　The parts, which might be unrelated when left on their own, may be brought together as a group, hence belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them. 　However, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole—until a common relation is established among all parts. 　This does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization. 　The concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, and might sometimes have a more specific meaning in a specialized context (e.g. generalization in psychology, generalization in learning). 　In general, given two related concepts A and B, A is a "generalization" of B (equiv., B is a special case of A) if and only if both of the following hold: Every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A. There are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B. For example, the concept animal is a generalization of the concept bird, since every bird is an animal, but not all animals are birds (dogs, for instance). 　For more, see Specialisation (biology).

<font size=3>
Wellington (Māori: Te Whanganui-a-Tara [tɛ ˈɸaŋanʉi a taɾa] or Pōneke [pɔːnɛkɛ]) is the capital city of New Zealand. 　It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. 　Wellington is the third-largest city in New Zealand by metro area, and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region. 　It is the world's southernmost capital of a sovereign state. 　Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world's windiest city by average wind speed. 　Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century, with initial settlement by Māori iwi such as Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. 　The disruptions of the Musket Wars led to them being overwhelmed by northern iwi such as Te Āti Awa by the early 19th century. 　Wellington's current form was originally designed by Captain William Mein Smith, the first Surveyor General for Edward Wakefield's New Zealand Company, in 1840. 　The Wellington urban area, which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of 212,000 as of June 2022. 　The wider Wellington metropolitan area, including the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt, has a population of 434,900 as of June 2022. 　The city has served as New Zealand's capital since 1865, a status that is not defined in legislation, but established by convention; the New Zealand Government and Parliament, the Supreme Court and most of the public service are based in the city. 　Wellington's economy is primarily service-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, government, and the film industry. 　It is the centre of New Zealand's film and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation, with two public research universities. 　Wellington is one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. 　The city is chiefly served by Wellington International Airport in Rongotai, the country's second-busiest airport. 　Wellington's transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa, and ferries connect the city to the South Island. 　Often referred to as New Zealand's cultural capital, the culture of Wellington is a diverse and often youth-driven one which has wielded influence across Oceania. 　One of the world's most liveable cities, the 2021 Global Livability Ranking tied Wellington with Tokyo as fourth in the world. 　From 2017 to 2018, Deutsche Bank ranked it first in the world for both livability and non-pollution. 　Cultural precincts such as Cuba Street and Newtown are renowned for creative innovation, "op shops", historic character, and food. 　Wellington is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region, being ranked 35th in the world by the Global Financial Centres Index for 2021. 　The global city has grown from a bustling Māori settlement, to a colonial outpost, and from there to an Australasian capital that has experienced a "remarkable creative resurgence".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra>Ultra</a> 

<font size=3>
Ultra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. 　Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence. 　The name arose because the intelligence obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used (Most Secret) and so was regarded as being Ultra Secret. 　Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence. 　The code name Boniface was used as a cover name for Ultra. 　In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans, British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy, Boniface, who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany. 　Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the human intelligence from the Boniface network. 　The U.S. used the codename Magic for its decrypts from Japanese sources, including the "Purple" cipher. 　Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine. 　Used properly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in practice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. 　The term "Ultra" has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts". 　However, Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used by the German High Command, and the Hagelin machine. 　Many observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies. 　Winston Churchill was reported to have told King George VI, when presenting to him Stewart Menzies (head of the Secret Intelligence Service and the person who controlled distribution of Ultra decrypts to the government): "It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!" 　F. W. Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end describing Ultra as having been "decisive" to Allied victory. 　Sir Harry Hinsley, Bletchley Park veteran and official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment of Ultra, saying that while the Allies would have won the war without it, "the war would have been something like two years longer, perhaps three years longer, possibly four years longer than it was." 　However, Hinsley and others have emphasized the difficulties of counterfactual history in attempting such conclusions, and some historians, such as Keegan, have said the shortening might have been as little as the three months it took the United States to deploy the atomic bomb. 　The existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war. 　Since the Ultra story was widely disseminated by Winterbotham in 1974, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. 　For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, "Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Enigma communications, General Bernard Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail." 　Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction. 　As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, "The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy."

A curse (also called an imprecation, malediction, execration, malison, anathema, or commination) is any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object. 　In particular, "curse" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic (usually black magic) or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. 　In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. 　To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called "removal" or "breaking", as the spell has to be dispelled, and often requires elaborate rituals or prayers.

A copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, display, and perform a creative work, usually for a limited time. 　The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. 　Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. 　A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States. 　Some jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. 　It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.　[better source needed] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution. 　Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". 　This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. 　Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent. 　Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. 　Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without a formal registration. 　When the copyright of a work expires, it enters the public domain.

Burial, also known as interment or inhumation, is a method of final disposition whereby a dead body is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects. 　This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. 　A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition. 　Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.　[citation needed] Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. 　It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life. 　Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called "green burial"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can retard decomposition of the body. 　Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. 　Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance. 　The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. 　Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others "banish" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. 　Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. 　Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. 　However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. 　Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once. 　Alternatives to burial include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea and cryopreservation. 　Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. 　Humans are not the only species to bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees, elephants, and possibly dogs.

Coordinates: 33°50′N 35°50′E﻿ / ﻿33.833°N 35.833°E﻿ / 33.833; 35.833Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənɒn, -nən/ LEB-ə-non, -⁠nən; Arabic: لُبْنَان, romanized: lubnān, Lebanese Arabic pronunciation: [lɪbˈneːn]; French: Liban), officially the Republic of Lebanon (Arabic: الجمهورية اللبنانية) or the Lebanese Republic, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is located between Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus lies to its west across the Mediterranean Sea; its location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has contributed to its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious diversity. 　It is part of the Levant region of the Middle East. 　Lebanon is home to roughly five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi), making it the second smallest country in continental Asia. 　The official language of the state is Arabic, while French is also formally recognized; Lebanese Arabic is used alongside Modern Standard Arabic throughout the country. 　The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back to 5,000 BCE. 　From c. 　3200–539 BC, it was home to the flourishing Phoenician civilization before being annexed by various Near Eastern empires. 　In 64 BC, the Roman Empire conquered the region, and the region became a major center for Christianity under the Byzantine Empire. 　In the 7th century, the Muslim conquest of the Levant established caliphal rule. 　The 11th century saw the start of the Crusades and the establishment of Crusader States in the region only for it to be later reclaimed by the Ayyubids and Mamluks before being ceded to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. 　Under Sultan Abdulmejid I, the first Lebanese protostate took form in the 19th century as the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, created as a home for the Maronite Christians under the Tanzimat reforms. 　Following the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War I, the five Ottoman provinces constituting modern-day Lebanon came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, under which its French-ruled predecessor state of Greater Lebanon was established. 　Following the invasion and occupation of the French Third Republic by Nazi Germany during World War II, French rule over the region weakened. 　Upon gaining its independence from Free France in 1943, Lebanon established a unique confessionalist form of government, with the state's major religious sects being apportioned specific political powers. 　Lebanon initially was relatively stable. 　This stability was short-lived and was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of large-scale fighting in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) between various political and sectarian factions. 　During this period, Lebanon was also subjected to overlapping foreign military occupations by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000. 　Since the end of the war, there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure. 　Lebanon is a developing country, ranking 112th on the Human Development Index. 　It has been classified as an upper middle income state. 　However, the Lebanese liquidity crisis, corruption as well as recent events have precipitated the collapse of currency, political instability, widespread shortages, high unemployment and poverty. 　The World Bank defined the economic crisis in Lebanon as one of the worst in the world since the 19th century. 　Despite the country's small size, Lebanese culture is renowned both in the Middle East and globally, primarily powered by its extensive diaspora. 　Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations and is a member of the Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

<font size=3>
A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. 　If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually rather referred to as a multiple unit, motor coach, railcar or power car; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight. 　Traditionally, locomotives pulled trains from the front. 　However, push-pull operation has become common, where the train may have a locomotive (or locomotives) at the front, at the rear, or at each end. 　Most recently railroads have begun adopting DPU or distributed power. 　The front may have one or two locomotives followed by a mid-train locomotive that is controlled remotely from the lead unit.

Coordinates: 7°N 65°W﻿ / ﻿7°N 65°W﻿ / 7; -65 Venezuela (/ˌvɛnəˈzweɪlə/; American Spanish: [beneˈswela] (listen)), officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Spanish: República Bolivariana de Venezuela), is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. 　It has a territorial extension of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi), and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022. 　The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. 　The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. 　The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. 　Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. 　Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital. 　The territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. 　In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part, as a department, of the first federal Republic of Colombia (historiographically known as Gran Colombia). 　It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. 　During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. 　Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. 　Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. 　The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. 　The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. 　However, poverty began to increase in the 2010s. 　The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. 　Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. 　It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption. 　Venezuela is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development Index. 　It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. 　Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. 　The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. 　The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. 　These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. 　By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. 　The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates. 　Venezuela is a charter member of the UN, Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), ALBA, Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity>Quantity</a> 

<font size=3>
Quantity or amount is a property that can exist as a multitude or magnitude, which illustrate discontinuity and continuity. 　Quantities can be compared in terms of "more", "less", or "equal", or by assigning a numerical value multiple of a unit of measurement. 　Mass, time, distance, heat, and angle are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties. 　Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. 　Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. 　Under the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd, and number; all which are cases of collective nouns. 　Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: matter, mass, energy, liquid, material—all cases of non-collective nouns. 　Along with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.
