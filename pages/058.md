<font size=3>
Waste (or wastes) are unwanted or unusable materials. 　Waste is any substance discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use. 　A by-product, by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. 　A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero. 　Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others.

<font size=3>
Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. 　It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). 　It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. 　It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative. 　Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. 　The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products. 　Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing>Breathing</a> 
<font size=3>
Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and from the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment, mostly to flush out carbon dioxide and bring in oxygen. 　All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy from the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. 　Breathing, or "external respiration", brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion. 　The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. 　The breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli. 　The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, and is one of the four primary vital signs of life. 　Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. 　Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). 　Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. 　Both cause distressing symptoms. 　Breathing has other important functions. 　It provides a mechanism for speech, laughter and similar expressions of the emotions. 　It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. 　Animals that cannot thermoregulate by perspiration, because they lack sufficient sweat glands, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.

Omega (/oʊˈmiːɡə, oʊˈmɛɡə, oʊˈmeɪɡə, əˈmiːɡə/; capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Ancient Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the twenty-fourth and final letter in the Greek alphabet. 　In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. 　The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little"). 　In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [ɔː], comparable to the "aw" of the English word raw in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o] , and the digraph ου which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [oː]. 　In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o̞] or IPA: [ɔ̝]. 　The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o. 　As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega.

<font size=3>
Suffering, or pain in a broad sense, may be an experience of unpleasantness or aversion, possibly associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. 　Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena. 　The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness. 　Suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. 　It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. 　Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. 　Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved. 　Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. 　As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. 　These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

<font size=3>
The reputation of a social entity (a person, a social group, an organization, or a place) is an opinion about that entity typically as a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria, such as behavior or performance. 　Reputation is a ubiquitous, spontaneous, and highly efficient mechanism of social control. 　It is a subject of study in social, management, and technological sciences. 　Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. 　Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. 　At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). 　It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. 　Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control. 　The concept of reputation is considered important in business, politics, education, online communities, and many other fields, and it may be considered as a reflection of that social entity's identity.

<font size=3>
In botany, a plant shoot consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds. 　The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. 　In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. 　In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. 　Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. 　Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. 　As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. 　Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable. 　The shoot of a cucumber Edible shoots of Sachaline Sunflower seedlings germinate A young hass avocado shoot

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 33°N 44°E﻿ / ﻿33°N 44°E﻿ / 33; 44 Iraq, officially the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest and Syria to the west. 　The capital and largest city is Baghdad. 　Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Iraqi Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, Persians and Shabakis with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. 　The majority of the country's 40 million residents are Muslims – the notable other faiths are Christianity, Yazidism, Mandaeism, Yarsanism and Zoroastrianism. 　The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish; others also recognised in specific regions are Suret (Assyrian), Turkish and Armenian. 　Starting as early as the 6th millennium BC, the fertile alluvial plains between Iraq's Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, referred to as Mesopotamia, gave rise to some of the world's earliest cities, civilisations, and empires ofthe indigenous Mesopotamians in Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria. 　Mesopotamia was a "Cradle of Civilisation" that saw the independent development of a writing system, mathematics, timekeeping, a calendar, astrology, and a law code. 　Following the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital and the largest city of the Abbasid Caliphate, and during the Islamic Golden Age, the city evolved into a significant cultural and intellectual center, and garnered it a worldwide reputation for its academic institutions, including House of Wisdom. 　The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 during the siege of Baghdad, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. 　Modern Iraq dates back to 1920, when the British Mandate for Mesopotamia, joining three Ottoman vilayets, was created under the authority of the League of Nations. 　A British-backed Kingdom was established in 1921 under Faisal I of Iraq. 　The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from the UK in 1932. 　In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created. 　Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. 　In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, sparking a protracted war which would last for almost eight years, and end in a stalemate with devastating losses for both countries. 　After an invasion by the United States and its allies in 2003, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power, and multi-party parliamentary elections were held in 2005. 　The US presence in Iraq ended in 2011. 　Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic. 　The president is the head of state, the prime minister is the head of government, and the constitution provides for two deliberative bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. 　The judiciary is free and independent of the executive and the legislature. 　Iraq is considered an emerging middle power with a strategic location and a founding member of the United Nations, the OPEC as well as of the Arab League, OIC, Non-Aligned Movement and the IMF. 　From 1920 to 2005 Iraq experienced spells of significant economic and military growth and briefer instability including wars. 　Since the inception of the current multipartite system in 2005, the country has seen further growth and steadier international investment, and a major decline in factional domestic attacks.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer>Beer</a> 
<font size=3>
Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed type of alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after potable water and tea. 　It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. 　During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. 　Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. 　Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. 　In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation. 　Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. 　Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. 　The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. 　The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above. 　Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling, pub quizzes and pub games. 　When beer is distilled, the resulting liquor is a form of whisky.

<font size=3>
Geometry (from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría) 'land measurement'; from γῆ (gê) 'earth, land', and μέτρον (métron) 'a measure')[citation needed] is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. 　It is concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. 　A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. 　Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts. 　During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. 　One of the oldest such discoveries is Carl Friedrich Gauss' Theorema Egregiumcode: lat promoted to code: la ("remarkable theorem") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. 　This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry. 　Later in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. 　The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry. 　Since then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.　—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others. 　Originally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. 　Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. 　For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking>Ranking</a> 
<font size=3>
A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either "ranked higher than", "ranked lower than" or "ranked equal to" the second. 　In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. 　It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. 　The rankings themselves are totally ordered. 　For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. 　If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie. 　By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. 　Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see. 　Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)>Stress (biology)</a> 
<font size=3>
Stress, either physiological, biological or psychological, is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. 　Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. 　There are two hormones that an individual produces during a stressful situation, these are well known as adrenaline and cortisol. 　There are two kinds of stress hormone levels. 　Resting (basal) cortisol levels are normal everyday quantities that are essential for standard functioning. 　Reactive cortisol levels are increases in cortisol in response to stressors. 　Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. 　In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. 　The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. 　The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. 　The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. 　Through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism and susceptibility to diseases. 　Disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses.

Saturday is the day of the week between Friday and Sunday. 　No later than the 2nd century, the Romans named Saturday diēs Sāturnī ("Saturn's Day") for the planet Saturn, which controlled the first hour of that day, according to Vettius Valens. 　The day's name was introduced into West Germanic languages and is recorded in the Low German languages such as Middle Low German satersdach, saterdach, Middle Dutch saterdag (Modern Dutch zaterdag) and Old English Sæternesdæġ, Sæterndæġ or Sæterdæġ.

<font size=3>
A peninsula (from Latin paeninsula; from paene 'almost', and insula 'island') is a landform that extends from a mainland and is surrounded by water on most, but not all of its borders. 　A peninsula is also sometimes defined as a piece of land bordered by water on three of its sides. 　Peninsulas exist on all continents. 　The size of a peninsula can range from tiny to very large. 　The largest peninsula in the world is the Arabian Peninsula. 　Peninsulas form due to a variety of causes.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve>Curve</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight. 　Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. 　This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: "The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width." 　This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. 　In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. 　In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. 　This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). 　Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations. 　Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. 　This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. 　For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve. 　A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. 　More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. 　If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. 　In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. 　When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. 　Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. 　In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid>Fluid</a> 
<font size=3>
In physics, a fluid is a liquid, gas, or other material that continuously deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. 　They have zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, are substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them. 　Although the term fluid generally includes both the liquid and gas phases, its definition varies among branches of science. 　Definitions of solid vary as well, and depending on field, some substances can be both fluid and solid. 　Viscoelastic fluids like Silly Putty appear to behave similar to a solid when a sudden force is applied. 　Substances with a very high viscosity such as pitch appear to behave like a solid (see pitch drop experiment) as well. 　In particle physics, the concept is extended to include fluidic matters other than liquids or gases. 　A fluid in medicine or biology refers any liquid constituent of the body (body fluid), whereas "liquid" is not used in this sense. 　Sometimes liquids given for fluid replacement, either by drinking or by injection, are also called fluids (e.g. "drink plenty of fluids"). 　In hydraulics, fluid is a term which refers to liquids with certain properties, and is broader than (hydraulic) oils.
