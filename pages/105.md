<font size=3>
Roland (pronounced [ʁɔ.lɑ̃]; Old Frankish: *Hrōþiland; Medieval Latin: Hruodlandus or Rotholandus; Italian: Orlando or Rolando; died 15 August 778) was a Frankish military leader under Charlemagne who became one of the principal figures in the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. 　The historical Roland was military governor of the Breton March, responsible for defending Francia's frontier against the Bretons. 　His only historical attestation is in Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni, which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard killed in retribution by the Basques in Iberia at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. 　The story of Roland's death at Roncevaux Pass was embellished in later medieval and Renaissance literature. 　The first and most famous of these epic treatments was the Old French Chanson de Roland of the 11th century. 　Two masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso (by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto respectively), are even further detached from history than the earlier Chansons, similarly to the later Morgante by Luigi Pulci. 　Roland is poetically associated with his sword Durendal, his horse Veillantif, and his oliphant horn. 　In the late 17th century, French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote an opera titled Roland, based on the story of the title character.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic>Harmonic</a> 
<font size=3>
A harmonic is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency, the frequency of the original periodic signal, such as a sinusoidal wave. 　The original signal is also called the 1st harmonic, the other harmonics are known as higher harmonics. 　As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. 　The set of harmonics forms a harmonic series. 　The term is employed in various disciplines, including music, physics, acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. 　For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. 　An nth characteristic mode, for n > 1, will have nodes that are not vibrating. 　For example, the 3rd characteristic mode will have nodes at 1 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{3}}} L and 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} L, where L is the length of the string. 　In fact, each nth characteristic mode, for n not a multiple of 3, will not have nodes at these points. 　These other characteristic modes will be vibrating at the positions 1 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{3}}} L and 2 3 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}} L. If the player gently touches one of these positions, then these other characteristic modes will be suppressed. 　The tonal harmonics from these other characteristic modes will then also be suppressed. 　Consequently, the tonal harmonics from the nth characteristic modes, where n is a multiple of 3, will be made relatively more prominent. 　In music, harmonics are used on string instruments and wind instruments as a way of producing sound on the instrument, particularly to play higher notes and, with strings, obtain notes that have a unique sound quality or "tone colour". 　On strings, bowed harmonics have a "glassy", pure tone. 　On stringed instruments, harmonics are played by touching (but not fully pressing down the string) at an exact point on the string while sounding the string (plucking, bowing, etc.); this allows the harmonic to sound, a pitch which is always higher than the fundamental frequency of the string.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain>Fountain</a> 
<font size=3>
A fountain, from the Latin "fons" (genitive "fontis"), meaning source or spring, is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. 　It is also a structure that jets water into the air for a decorative or dramatic effect. 　Fountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. 　Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air. 　In addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. 　Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. 　In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. 　King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature. 　The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them. 　By the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. 　Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. 　The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water 140 metres (460 ft) in the air. 　The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which spouts water 260 metres (850 ft) above the Red Sea. 　Fountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. 　A splash pad or spray pool allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. 　The musical fountain combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects. 　Fountains can themselves also be musical instruments played by obstruction of one or more of their water jets. 　Drinking fountains provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo>Echo</a> 
<font size=3>
In audio signal processing and acoustics, an echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. 　The delay is directly proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener. 　Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and an empty room. 　A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.　[citation needed] The word echo derives from the Greek ἠχώ (ēchō), itself from ἦχος (ēchos), "sound". 　Echo in the Greek folk story is a mountain nymph whose ability to speak was cursed, leaving her able only to repeat the last words spoken to her. 　Some animals use echo for location sensing and navigation, such as cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats in a process known as echolocation. 　Echoes are also the basis of Sonar technology.

In Greek mythology, Echo (/ˈɛkoʊ/; Greek: Ἠχώ, Ēkhō, "echo", from ἦχος (ēchos), "sound") was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron. 　Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth. 　Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mount Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs. 　Echo, by trying to protect Zeus (as he had ordered her to do), endured Hera's wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last words spoken to her. 　So when Echo met Narcissus and fell in love with him, she was unable to tell him how she felt and was forced to watch him as he fell in love with himself.

Look up currency in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins. 　A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state. 　Under this definition, the British Pound Sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies. 　Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. 　Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance; i.e., legal tender laws may require a particular unit of account for payments to government agencies. 　Other definitions of the term "currency" appear in the respective synonymous articles: banknote, coin, and money. 　This article uses the definition which focuses on the currency systems of countries. 　One can classify currencies into three monetary systems: fiat money, commodity money, and representative money, depending on what guarantees a currency's value (the economy at large vs. the government's physical metal reserves). 　Some currencies function as legal tender in certain jurisdictions, or for specific purposes, such as payment to a government (taxes), or government agencies (fees, fines). 　Others simply get traded for their economic value. 　Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet. 　Whether government-backed digital notes and coins (such as the digital renminbi in China, for example) will be successfully developed and utilized remains dubious. 　Decentralized digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, are different because they are not issued by a government monetary authority; specifically, bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency and leader in terms of market capitalization, has a fixed supply and is therefore ostensibly deflationary. 　Many warnings issued by various countries note the opportunities that cryptocurrencies create for illegal activities such as scams, ransomware, money laundering and terrorism. 　In 2014, the United States IRS issued a statement explaining that virtual currency is treated as property for Federal income-tax purposes, and it provide examples of how long-standing tax principles applicable to transactions involving property apply to virtual currency.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild>Guild</a> 
<font size=3>
A guild (/ɡɪld/ GILD) is an association of artisans and merchants who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular territory. 　The earliest types of guild formed as organizations of tradespeople belonging to a professional association. 　They sometimes depended on grants of letters patent from a monarch or other ruler to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials, but most were regulated by the city government. 　Guild members found guilty of cheating the public would be fined or banned from the guild. 　A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as guild meeting-places. 　Typically the key "privilege" was that only guild members were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. 　There might be controls on minimum or maximum prices, hours of trading, numbers of apprentices, and many other things. 　Critics argued that these rules reduced free competition, but defenders maintained that they protected professional standards. 　An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at Bologna (established in 1088), Oxford (at least since 1096) and Paris (c. 1150); they originated as guilds of students (as at Bologna) or of masters (as at Paris).

<font size=3>
A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. 　In literature, there exist several slightly deviating definitions. 　Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. 　Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.　: 340  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. 　Another point of view is that a breed is consistent enough in type to be logically grouped together and when mated within the group produce the same type. 　When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this ability – known as "breeding true" – is a requirement for a breed. 　Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. 　The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. 　Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, subspecies, botanical variety, even different genera) are referred to as hybrids.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration>Frustration</a> 
<font size=3>
In psychology, frustration is a common emotional response to opposition, related to anger, annoyance and disappointment. 　Frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's will or goal and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. 　There are two types of frustration: internal and external. 　Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling personal goals, desires, instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived deficiencies, such as a lack of confidence or fear of social situations. 　Conflict, such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration or annoyance and can create cognitive dissonance. 　External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time. 　There are multiple ways individuals cope with frustration such as passive–aggressive behavior, anger, or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive. 　This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. 　However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.

Splitting (also called black-and-white thinking or all-or-nothing thinking) is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both perceived positive and negative qualities of something into a cohesive, realistic whole. 　It is a common defense mechanism wherein the individual tends to think in extremes (e.g., an individual's actions and motivations are all good or all bad with no middle ground). 　This kind of dichotomous interpretation is contrasted by an acknowledgement of certain nuances known as "shades of gray". 　Splitting was first described by Ronald Fairbairn in his formulation of object relations theory; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. 　In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.

<font size=3>
A sensor is a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of sensing a physical phenomenon. 　In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. 　Sensors are always used with other electronics. 　Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. 　With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors. 　Analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. 　Their applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. 　There is a wide range of other sensors that measure chemical and physical properties of materials, including optical sensors for refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement, and electro-chemical sensors for monitoring pH of fluids. 　A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much its output changes when the input quantity it measures changes. 　For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, its sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic). 　Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. 　Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages. 　Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. 　In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. 　Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance. 　Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.

<font size=3>
Anxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events. 　Anxiety is different than fear in that the former is defined as the anticipation of a future threat whereas the latter is defined as the emotional response to a real threat. 　It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. 　Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. 　It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one's breath, tightness in the abdominal region, nausea, and problems in concentration. 　Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat (fight or flight response); anxiety involves the expectation of future threat including dread. 　People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. 　The emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time-periods in response to specific events, and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder). 　The difference between anxiety disorder (as mental disorder) and anxiety (as normal emotion), is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety most of the days during approximately 6 months, or even during shorter time-periods in children. 　Anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades. 　Besides, strong percepts of anxiety exist within other mental disorders, e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder.

<font size=3>
A corn or clavus (plural clavi or clavuses) is a cone-shaped and often painful inwardly directed callus of dead skin that forms at a pressure point near a bone, or on a weight-bearing part of the body. 　When on the feet, corns can be so painful as to interfere with walking. 　The visible portion of the corn tends to be more-or-less round, but corns are defined by having a hard tapering root that is directed inward, and pressure on the corn pushes this root deeper into the flesh. 　(Thus the Latin term clavus 'nail'.) 　Pressure corns usually occur on thin or glabrous (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces, especially on the dorsal surface of toes or fingers, but corns triggered by an acute injury (such as a thorn) may occur on the thicker skin of the palms or bottom of the feet (palmar corns and plantar corns). 　Pressure corns form when chronic pressure on the skin against an underlying bone traces a usually elliptical path during the rubbing motion. 　The corn forms at the center of the pressure point and gradually widens and deepens. 　Corns from an acute injury, such as a from a thorn in the sole of the foot, may form due to the weight of the body, when the process that creates the usually evenly developing plantar callus is concentrated at the point of the healing injury, as an internal callus may be triggered by pressure on the transitional scar tissue. 　Once formed, the corn itself becomes the pressure point that generates the callus. 　Plantar corns are superficially similar to plantar warts, but the cause and treatment are very different.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn>Corn</a> 
<font size=3>
Corn is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. 　The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences (or "tassels") and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits. 　The term corn is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage as a common name because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike maize, which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. 　Corn has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of corn surpassing that of wheat or rice. 　In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), corn is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other corn products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. 　The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. 　Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as feedstocks for the chemical industry. 　Corn is also used in making ethanol and other biofuels. 　Corn is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of corn is produced each year than any other grain. 　In 2021, total world production was 1.2 billion tonnes. 　Corn is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas, with 384 million metric tons grown in the United States alone in 2021.[citation needed] Genetically modified corn made up 85% of the corn planted in the United States in 2009. 　Subsidies in the United States help to account for its high level of cultivation of corn and its position as the largest producer in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief>Grief</a> 
<font size=3>
Grief is the response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or some living thing that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. 　Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. 　While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, while grief is the reaction to that loss. 　The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. 　Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract; physical loss is related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are more abstract, possibly relating to aspects of a person's social interactions.
