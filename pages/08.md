## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather>Weather</a> 

<font size=3>
Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. 　On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. 　Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. 　When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth. 　Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. 　These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. 　The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. 　Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. 　Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. 　On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually. 　Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change. 　Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. 　Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. 　Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. 　Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. 　Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. 　A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. 　However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. 　A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. 　The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height>Height</a> 

<font size=3>
Height is measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how "tall" something or someone is) or vertical position (how "high" a point is). 　For example, "The height of that building is 50 m" or "The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m". 　For example, "Christopher Columbus is 5 foot 2 inches in vertical height." 　When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude. 　Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation. 　In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value. 　If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero. 　In the case of three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or "above") the x-y plane.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_(zoology)>Display (zoology)</a> 

<font size=3>
Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli. 　These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well. 　Evolution has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an ecosystem. 　It is connected to sexual selection and survival of the species in various ways. 　Typically, display behaviour is used for courtship between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate. 　In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group. 　A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed. 　Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours - from invertebrates such as the simple jumping spider to the more complex vertebrates like the harbour seal.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance>Alliance</a> 

<font size=3>
An alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out among them. 　Members of an alliance are called allies. 　Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances. 　When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II. 　A formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. 　According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war. 　When spelled with a capital "A", "Allies" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). 　The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. 　The Allied Powers in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. 　Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat. 　After the end of World War II and during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed as a political and military alliance that promotes anti-communist values. 　More recently, the term "Allied forces" has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as "Coalition forces" or, as by the George W. Bush administration, "the coalition of the willing".

Housing, or more generally, living spaces, refers to the construction and assigned usage of houses or buildings individually or collectively, for the purpose of shelter. 　Housing ensures that members of society have a place to live, whether it is a home or some other kind of dwelling, lodging or shelter. 　Many governments have one or more housing authorities, sometimes also called a housing ministry or housing department. 　Housing in many different areas consists of public, social and private housing. 　In the United States, it was not until the 19th and 20th century that there was a lot more government involvement in housing. 　It was mainly aimed at helping those who were poor in the community.　[citation needed] Public housing provides help and assistance to those who are poor and mainly low-income earners. 　A study report shows that there are many individuals living in public housing. 　There are over 1.2 million families or households. 　These types of housing were built mainly to provide people, mainly those who are low-income and elderly, with safe, affordable, and good housing units. 　There are many people who are a part of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 　When counting, there are over nine hundred thousand participants in this program.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine>Wine</a> 

<font size=3>
Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. 　Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. 　Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. 　These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. 　Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. 　These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. 　Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of other crops including rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry. 　Wine has been produced for thousands of years. 　The earliest evidence of wine is from the Caucasus region in today's Georgia (6000 BCE), Persia (5000 BCE), Italy and Armenia (4000 BCE). 　New World wine has some connection to alcoholic beverages made by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, but is mainly connected to later Spanish traditions in New Spain. 　Later, as Old World wine further developed viticulture techniques, Europe would encompass three of the largest wine-producing regions. 　Today, the five countries with the largest wine producing regions are in Italy, Spain, France, the United States, and China. 　Wine has long played an important role in religion. 　Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, and Christianity in the Eucharist. 　Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. 　Similarly the largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California.

<font size=3>
Philadelphia, often called Philly, is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the second largest city in both the Northeast megalopolis and Mid-Atlantic regions after New York City. 　It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States, and once served as the nation's capital city until 1800. 　The city's population at the 2020 census was 1,603,797, and over 56 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of Philadelphia. 　Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the Delaware Valley, the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions with 6.245 million residents in 2020. 　Philadelphia is known both for its extensive contributions to American history and for its role in the life sciences, business and industry, art, literature, and music. 　Philadelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. 　The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence. 　Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774 following the Boston Tea Party, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as "the most potent and consequential words in American history". 　Once the Revolutionary War commenced, both the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. 　The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. 　Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 while the new national capital of Washington, D.C., was under construction. 　With 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research. 　As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$479 billion. 　The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022. 　The Philadelphia skyline, which includes several globally renowned commercial skyscrapers, is expanding, primarily with new residential high-rise condominiums. 　Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley are a biotechnology and venture capital hub; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by NASDAQ, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading. 　30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, including Philadelphia International Airport, the PhilaPort seaport, freight rail infrastructure, roadway traffic capacity, and warehouse storage space, are all expanding. 　Philadelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation. 　Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park. 　The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties. 　With five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans. 　The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. 　Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock. 　Philadelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731), hospital (1751), medical school (1765), national capital (1774), university (by some accounts) (1779), stock exchange (1790), zoo (1874), and business school (1881). 　Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall. 　From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. 　In 2021, Time magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas>Christmas</a> 

<font size=3>
Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. 　A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. 　Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it. 　The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. 　When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word. 　There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25. 　This corresponds to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. 　It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. 　Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. 　However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. 　For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas. 　The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. 　Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. 　In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. 　Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. 　Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.

<font size=3>
Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, and may be viewed as the opposite of success. 　The criteria for failure depends on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. 　One person might consider a failure what another person considers a success, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. 　Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a failure, another might consider to be a success, a qualified success or a neutral situation. 　It may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. 　Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the success or failure of a situation may itself be a significant task.

<font size=3>
An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. 　Uncles who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. 　The female counterpart of an uncle is an aunt, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece. 　The word comes from Latin: avunculus, the diminutive of avus (grandfather), and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family. 　In some cultures and families, children may refer to the cousins of their parents as uncle (or aunt). 　It is also used as a title of respect for older relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, family friends, and even total strangers in some cultures, for example Aboriginal Australian elders. 　Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship. 　Any social institution where a special relationship exists between a man and his sisters' children is known as an avunculate (or avunculism or avuncularism). 　This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. 　Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and matrilineal descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty>Treaty</a> 

<font size=3>
A treaty is a formal, legally binding written agreement between actors in international law. 　It is usually made by and between sovereign states, but can include international organizations, individuals, business entities, and other legal persons. 　A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms. 　However, only documents that are legally binding on the parties are considered treaties under international law. 　Treaties vary on the basis of obligations (the extent to which states are bound to the rules), precision (the extent to which the rules are unambiguous), and delegation (the extent to which third parties have authority to interpret, apply and make rules). 　Treaties are among the earliest manifestations of international relations, with the first known example being a border agreement between the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma around 3100 BC. 　International agreements were used in some form by most major civilizations, growing in both sophistication and number during the early modern era. 　The early 19th century saw developments in diplomacy, foreign policy, and international law reflected by the widespread use of treaties. 　The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codified these practices, setting forth guidelines and rules for creating, amending, interpreting, and terminating treaties and for resolving disputes and alleged breaches. 　Treaties are roughly analogous to contracts in that they establish the rights and binding obligations of the parties. 　They vary significantly in form, substance, and complexity and govern a wide variety of matters, such as security, trade, environment, and human rights. 　Treaties may be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (involving more than two countries). 　They may also be used to establish international institutions, such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations, for which they often provide a governing framework. 　Treaties serve as primary sources of international law and have codified or established most international legal principles since the early 20th century. 　Notwithstanding the Law of Treaties and customary international law, treaties are not required to follow any standard form. 　Nevertheless, all valid treaties must comply with the legal principle of pacta sunt servanda (Latin: "agreements must be kept"), under which parties are committed to perform their duties and honor their agreements in good faith. 　A treaty may also be invalidated, and thus rendered unenforceable, if it violates a preemptory norm (jus cogens), such as permitting a war of aggression or crimes against humanity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)>Mechanism (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In the science of biology, a mechanism is a system of causally interacting parts and processes that produce one or more effects. 　Scientists explain phenomena by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of biological evolution; other mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. 　In ecology, mechanisms such as predation and host-parasite interactions produce change in ecological systems. 　In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. 　For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(sociology)>Mechanism (sociology)</a> 

<font size=3>
The term social mechanisms and mechanism-based explanations of social phenomena originate from the philosophy of science. 　The core thinking behind the mechanism approach has been expressed as follows by Elster (1989: 3-4): “To explain an event is to give an account of why it happened. Usually… this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause of the event we want to explain…. [But] to cite the cause is not enough: the causal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.” 　Existing definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them all is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by specifying in detail how they were brought about. 　The currently most satisfactory discussion of the mechanism concept is found in Machamer, Darden and Craver (2000). 　Following them, mechanisms can be said to consist of entities (with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either by themselves or in concert with other entities. 　These activities bring about change, and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and activities of the entities and the relations between them. 　A mechanism, thus defined, refers to a constellation of entities and activities that are organized such that they regularly bring about a particular type of outcome, and we explain an observed outcome by referring to the mechanism by which such outcomes are regularly brought about (see also Hedström and Ylikoski 2010).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy>Strategy</a> 

<font size=3>
Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship") is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty. 　In the sense of the "art of the general", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. 　From then until the 20th century, the word "strategy" came to denote "a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. 　Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. 　Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. 　A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). 　Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. 　It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking. 　Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning, while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value – choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals. 　while Max McKeown (2011) argues that "strategy is about shaping the future" and is the human attempt to get to "desirable ends with available means". 　Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as "a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully." 　Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.

<font size=3>
A trail, also known as a path or track, is an unpaved lane or small road usually passing through a natural area. 　In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a path or footpath is the preferred term for a pedestrian or hiking trail. 　The term is also applied in North America to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways. 　In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by explorers and migrants (e.g. the Oregon Trail). 　In the United States, "trace" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace. 　Some trails are dedicated only for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing, but not more than one use; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians alike. 　There are also unpaved trails used by dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles, and in some places, like the Alps, trails are used for moving cattle and other livestock.

<font size=3>
L. Ron Hubbard used the term Incident in a specific context for auditing in Scientology and Dianetics: the description of space operatic events in the Universe's distant past, involving alien interventions in past lives. 　It is a basic belief of Scientology that a human being is an immortal spiritual being, termed a thetan, trapped on planet Earth in a "meat body". 　Although said to be capable of occurring anywhere and at any time, Hubbard's writings described some incidents in particular, set in Earth's prehistory. 　Many of them first appeared in Hubbard's book What to Audit (later retitled A History of Man). 　In his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes Incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few trillion years. 　Most of these followed a consistent pattern, wherein a hostile alien civilization captured and brainwashed free thetans. 　Often, instances of implantation are termed Incidents, while the subject of the implants are often termed Goals. 　Some Incidents are simply unusual and traumatic events, whereof the memory is said to linger for trillions of years. 　According to Hubbard, only Scientology's methods can remove the resulting neuroses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket>Cricket</a> 

<font size=3>
Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 　The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). 　Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. 　When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 　The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 　They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. 　Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. 　Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. 　In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. 　The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. 　It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. 　The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. 　The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. 　The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies. 　Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. 　The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

<font size=3>
Toronto (/təˈrɒntoʊ/ (listen) tə-RON-toh; locally [təˈɹɒɾ̃ə] or [ˈtɹɒɾ̃ə]) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. 　With a recorded population of 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. 　The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population of 6,712,341. 　Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. 　Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. 　After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. 　During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. 　York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. 　It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. 　The city proper has since expanded past its original limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi). 　The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. 　More than half of residents were born outside of Canada, more than half of residents belong to a visible minority group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. 　While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. 　The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. 　The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city. 　Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets. 　Its varied cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. 　Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-standing structure on land outside of Asia, the CN Tower. 　The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. 　Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism. 　Toronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon Valley and New York City, and the fastest growing.

<font size=3>
Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). 　The molecules in a solid are closely packed together and contain the least amount of kinetic energy. 　A solid is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to a force applied to the surface. 　Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire available volume like a gas. 　The atoms in a solid are bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary ice), or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass). 　Solids cannot be compressed with little pressure whereas gases can be compressed with little pressure because the molecules in a gas are loosely packed. 　The branch of physics that deals with solids is called solid-state physics, and is the main branch of condensed matter physics (which also includes liquids). 　Materials science is primarily concerned with the physical and chemical properties of solids. 　Solid-state chemistry is especially concerned with the synthesis of novel materials, as well as the science of identification and chemical composition.

Look up stable in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A stable is a building in which livestock, especially horses, are kept. 　It most commonly means a building that is divided into separate stalls for individual animals and livestock. 　There are many different types of stables in use today; the American-style barn, for instance, is a large barn with a door at each end and individual stalls inside or free-standing stables with top and bottom-opening doors. 　The term "stable" is also used to describe a group of animals kept by one owner, regardless of housing or location. 　The exterior design of a stable can vary widely, based on climate, building materials, historical period and cultural styles of architecture. 　A wide range of building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood and steel. 　Stables also range widely in size, from a small building housing one or two animals to facilities at agricultural shows or race tracks that can house hundreds of animals.

<font size=3>
Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman is a webcomic by Christopher C. Livingston that parodies the first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. 　The comic is illustrated with screenshots of characters posed using Garry's Mod, a tool which allows manipulation of the Source engine used by Half-Life 2. 　The comic ran from May 2005 to November 2006 and had 205 issues. 　While Half-Life 2 follows protagonist Gordon Freeman in a dystopian future, Concerned follows "Gordon Frohman", a dangerously clumsy character who arrives in the setting of the game a few weeks before Freeman does. 　The webcomic's dark humor is derived from its contrasts with the game and through references to the game's shortcomings. 　On several occasions in the comic, Frohman becomes the cause of various disastrous circumstances that Freeman will later encounter. 　Several reviews of Concerned praised the attention to writing and presentation and the comic's humor. 　Livingston also reported positive reception from staff at Valve, the developer company of Half-Life 2, who were pleased to have a comic based on their game.

<font size=3>
The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of a typical tetrapod. 　It manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste. 　The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. 　It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. 　The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. 　A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. 　The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. 　The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus, on the tongue's surface. 　There are two groups of muscles of the tongue. 　The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone. 　The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet>Planet</a> 

<font size=3>
A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. 　The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. 　Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion. 　The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 　These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole. 　All of them possess an atmosphere, although that of Mercury is tenuous, and some share such features as ice caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. 　Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields, and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites. 　The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn. 　The word planet probably comes from the Greek planḗtai, meaning "wanderers". 　In antiquity, this word referred to the Sun, Moon, and five points of light visible by the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. 　Planets have historically had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered Solar System bodies. 　Earth itself was recognized as a planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the 16th and 17th centuries. 　With the development of the telescope, the meaning of planet broadened to include objects only visible with assistance: the ice giants Uranus and Neptune; Ceres and other bodies later recognized to be part of the asteroid belt; and Pluto, later found to be the largest member of the collection of icy bodies known as the Kuiper belt. 　The discovery of other large objects in the Kuiper belt, particularly Eris, spurred debate about how exactly to define a planet. 　The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a standard by which the four terrestrials and four giants qualify, placing Ceres, Pluto and Eris in the category of dwarf planet, although many planetary scientists have continued to apply the term planet more broadly. 　Further advances in astronomy led to the discovery of over five thousand planets outside the Solar System, termed exoplanets. 　These include hot Jupiters—giant planets that orbit close to their parent stars—like 51 Pegasi b, super-Earths like Gliese 581c that have masses in between that of Earth and Neptune; and planets smaller than Earth, like Kepler-20e. 　Multiple exoplanets have been found to orbit in the habitable zones of their stars, but Earth remains the only planet known to support life.

Coordinates: 10°S 52°W﻿ / ﻿10°S 52°W﻿ / -10; -52 Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese: [bɾaˈziw] (listen)), officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: República Federativa do Brasil), is the largest country in South America and in Latin America. 　At 8.5 million square kilometers (3,300,000 sq mi) and with over 217 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. 　Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. 　The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. 　It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language. 　It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world, and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country. 　Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). 　It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent's land area. 　Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. 　This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss. 　The territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the discovered land for the Portuguese Empire. 　Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. 　In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. 　Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. 　The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. 　Slavery was abolished in 1888. 　The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. 　An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. 　Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic. 　Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　A major non-NATO ally of the United States, Brazil is a regional and middle power, and is also classified as an emerging power. 　Categorised as developing country with a high Human Development Index, Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy, having the twelfth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and ninth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America. 　As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country, Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years. 　However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. 　Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.

Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making"), also called verse, is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language − such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre − to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, a prosaic ostensible meaning. 　A poem is a literary composition, written by a poet, using this principle. 　Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe. 　It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys. 　Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE. 　The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian. 　Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, as well as religious hymns (the Sanskrit Rigveda, the Zoroastrian Gathas, the Hurrian songs, and the Hebrew Psalms); or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Egyptian Story of Sinuhe, the Indian epic poetry, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. 　Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. 　Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form, and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing. 　Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke emotive responses. 　Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and rhythm may convey musical or incantatory effects. 　The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony, and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. 　Similarly, figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, and metonymy establish a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. 　Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm. 　Some poetry types are unique to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. 　Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz, or Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter. 　There are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. 　Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, testing the principle of euphony itself or altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. 　In an increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles, and techniques from diverse cultures and languages. 　Poets have contributed to the evolution of the linguistic, expressive, and utilitarian qualities of their languages. 　A Western cultural tradition (extending at least from Homer to Rilke) associates the production of poetry with inspiration – often by a Muse (either classical or contemporary). 　In many poems, the lyrics are spoken by a character, who is called the speaker. 　This concept differentiates the speaker (character) from the poet (author), which is usually an important distinction: for example, if the poem runs "I killed a man in Reno", it is the speaker who is the murderer, not the poet himself.

<font size=3>
The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates. 　The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital organ in the digestive system. 　The stomach is involved in the gastric phase of digestion, following chewing. 　It performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and hydrochloric acid. 　In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine. 　The stomach secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. 　The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit>Suit</a> 

<font size=3>
A suit, lounge suit, or business suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes. 　A skirt suit is similar, but with a matching skirt instead of trousers. 　It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes. 　The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing, with roots in early modern Western Europe. 　After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit. 　Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. 　Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories. 　A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat. 　Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture. 　Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap. 　Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry. 　Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively. 　Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth. 　These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences. 　Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments. 　Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways: bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric; made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available; ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required; suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options

A cemetery is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or interred, it is a type of burial ground. 　The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, means "sleeping place") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs. 　The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard. 　The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an "above-ground grave" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice. 　In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries. 　These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs. 　Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled.

<font size=3>
Hearing, or auditory perception, is the ability to perceive sounds through an organ, such as an ear, by detecting vibrations as periodic changes in the pressure of a surrounding medium. 　The academic field concerned with hearing is auditory science. 　Sound may be heard through solid, liquid, or gaseous matter. 　It is one of the traditional five senses. 　Partial or total inability to hear is called hearing loss. 　In humans and other vertebrates, hearing is performed primarily by the auditory system: mechanical waves, known as vibrations, are detected by the ear and transduced into nerve impulses that are perceived by the brain (primarily in the temporal lobe). 　Like touch, audition requires sensitivity to the movement of molecules in the world outside the organism. 　Both hearing and touch are types of mechanosensation.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz>Jazz</a> 

<font size=3>
Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. 　Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. 　Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. 　Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals. 　As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. 　New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. 　But jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. 　In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. 　Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. 　Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. 　The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. 　Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. 　Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. 　In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. 　Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.

In mathematics, a ratio shows how many times one number contains another. 　For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). 　Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7). 　The numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. 　In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive. 　A ratio may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as "a to b" or "a:b", or by giving just the value of their quotient a/b. 　Equal quotients correspond to equal ratios. 　Consequently, a ratio may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, a fraction with the first number in the numerator and the second in the denominator, or as the value denoted by this fraction. 　Ratios of counts, given by (non-zero) natural numbers, are rational numbers, and may sometimes be natural numbers. 　When two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, their ratio is a dimensionless number. 　A quotient of two quantities that are measured with different units is called a rate.

This article contains Hebrew text. 　Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Hebrew letters. 　Jews (Hebrew: יְהוּדִים, ISO 259-2: Yehudim, Israeli pronunciation: [jehuˈdim]) or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah. 　Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people, although its observance varies from strict to none. 　Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in a part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. 　The Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). 　The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold in the region with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. 　Some consider that these Canaan-sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as the "Hebrews". 　The experience of life in the Jewish diaspora, from the Babylonian captivity and exile (though few sources mention this period in detail) to the Roman occupation and exile, and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland in the Levant thereafter became a major feature of Jewish history, identity, culture, and memory. 　In the following millennia, Jewish diaspora communities coalesced into three major ethnic subdivisions according to where their ancestors settled: the Ashkenazim (Central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardim (initially in the Iberian Peninsula), and the Mizrahim (Middle East and North Africa). 　Prior to World War II, the global Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million, representing around 0.7 percent of the world population at that time. 　During World War II, approximately 6 million Jews throughout Europe were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. 　Since then, the population has slowly risen again, and as of 2018[update], was estimated to be at 14.6–17.8 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank, comprising less than 0.2 percent of the total world population. 　The modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population. 　Jews have significantly influenced and contributed to human progress in many fields, both historically and in modern times, including in science and technology, philosophy, ethics, literature, politics, business, art, music, comedy, theatre, cinema, architecture, food, medicine, and religion. 　Jews wrote the Bible, founded Christianity, and had an indirect but profound influence on Islam. 　In these ways, Jews have also played a significant role in the development of Western culture.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales>Sales</a> 

<font size=3>
Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods sold in a given targeted time period. 　The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale. 　The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in response to an acquisition, appropriation, requisition, or a direct interaction with the buyer at the point of sale. 　There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. 　The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment. 　In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including salesclerk, shop assistant, and retail clerk. 　In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. 　In the United States, the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou>Thou</a> 

<font size=3>
The word thou (/ðaʊ/) is a second-person singular pronoun in English. 　It is now largely archaic, having been replaced in most contexts by the word you, although it remains in use in parts of Northern England and in Scots (/ðu/). 　Thou is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is thee (functioning as both accusative and dative); the possessive is thy (adjective) or thine (as an adjective before a vowel or as a possessive pronoun); and the reflexive is thyself. 　When thou is the grammatical subject of a finite verb in the indicative mood, the verb form typically ends in -(e)st (e.g. "thou goest", "thou do(e)st"), but in some cases just -t (e.g., "thou art"; "thou shalt"). 　Originally, thou was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ye, derived from an ancient Indo-European root. 　In Middle English, thou was sometimes represented with a scribal abbreviation that put a small "u" over the letter thorn: þͧ (later, in printing presses that lacked this letter, this abbreviation was sometimes rendered as yͧ). 　Starting in the 1300s, thou and thee were used to express familiarity, formality, or contempt, for addressing strangers, superiors, or inferiors, or in situations when indicating singularity to avoid confusion was needed; concurrently, the plural forms, ye and you began to also be used for singular: typically for addressing rulers, superiors, equals, inferiors, parents, younger persons, and significant others. 　In the 17th century, thou fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in regional dialects of England and Scotland, as well as in the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. 　The use of the pronoun is also still present in Christian prayer and in poetry. 　Early English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. 　The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to God in French (in Protestantism both in past and present, in Catholicism since the post–Vatican II reforms), German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Scottish Gaelic and many others (all of which maintain the use of an "informal" singular form of the second person in modern speech). 　In addition, the translators of the King James Version of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic and Koine Greek between singular and plural second-person pronouns and verb forms, so they used thou, thee, thy, and thine for singular, and ye, you, your, and yours for plural. 　In standard modern English, thou continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in wedding ceremonies, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language, and in certain fixed phrases such as "fare thee well". 　For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. 　Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of thou and ye through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as yinz, yous and y'all or the colloquial you guys. 　Ye remains common in some parts of Ireland, but the examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.

A passenger (also abbreviated as pax) is a person who travels in a vehicle, but does not bear any responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle, and is not a steward. 　The vehicles may be bicycles, buses, passenger trains, airliners, ships, ferryboats, and other methods of transportation. 　Crew members (if any), as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle, are usually not considered to be passengers. 　For example, a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a passenger while on duty and the same with those working in the kitchen or restaurant on board a ship as well as cleaning staff, but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger, even if the car was being driven on company business.

A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas. 　As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. 　A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design. 　Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. 　Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. 　Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. 　Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, rarely exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. 　Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. 　Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure;: 6  indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. 　Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world. 　In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. 　In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. 　In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments. 　In many areas of the decorative arts, from ceramics and textiles to wallpaper, "pattern" is used for an ornamental design that is manufactured, perhaps for many different shapes of object.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation>Translation</a> 

<font size=3>
Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. 　The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community. 　A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar, or syntax into the target-language rendering. 　On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. 　Translators, including early translators of sacred texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated. 　Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. 　More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated "language localisation".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)>Translation (biology)</a> 

<font size=3>
In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which ribosomes in the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum synthesize proteins after the process of transcription of DNA to RNA in the cell's nucleus. 　The entire process is called gene expression. 　In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide. 　The polypeptide later folds into an active protein and performs its functions in the cell. 　The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodon sequences to mRNA codons. 　The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is "read" by the ribosome. 　Translation proceeds in three phases: Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. 　The first tRNA is attached at the start codon. 　Elongation: The last tRNA validated by the small ribosomal subunit (accommodation) transfers the amino acid it carries to the large ribosomal subunit which binds it to the one of the precedingly admitted tRNA (transpeptidation). 　The ribosome then moves to the next mRNA codon to continue the process (translocation), creating an amino acid chain. 　Termination: When a stop codon is reached, the ribosome releases the polypeptide. 　The ribosomal complex remains intact and moves on to the next mRNA to be translated. 　In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), translation occurs in the cytosol, where the large and small subunits of the ribosome bind to the mRNA. 　In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called co-translational translocation. 　In co-translational translocation, the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the new protein is synthesized and released into the ER; the newly created polypeptide can be stored inside the ER for future vesicle transport and secretion outside the cell, or immediately secreted. 　Many types of transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA, do not undergo translation into proteins. 　A number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation. 　These include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin. 　Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any harm to a eukaryotic host's cells.

In actor-network theory (ANT), translation is the process that allows a network to be represented by a single entity, which can in itself be an individual or another network. 　It encompasses all negotiations, intrigues, calculations, and acts of persuasion, thanks to which an actor (or actant) takes authority to speak or act on behalf of other actors. 　According to ANT, an actor is an actant, something made to act, therefore it includes both human and non-human entities. 　Non-humans can have interests, they can enroll others, in exactly the same way as humans do. 　The concept of translation was developed by the French philosopher Michel Serres, and then applied to sociology by Michel Callon.

A nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. 　Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. 　Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. 　In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. 　The protruding nose that completely separate from the mouth part is a characteristic found only in therian mammals. 　It has been theorized that this unique mammalian nose evolved from the anterior part of the upper jaw of the reptilian-like ancestors (synapsids).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze>Bronze</a> 

<font size=3>
Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12–12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (including aluminium, manganese, nickel, or zinc) and sometimes non-metals, such as phosphorus, or metalloids such as arsenic or silicon. 　These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability. 　The archaeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age. 　The beginning of the Bronze Age in western Eurasia and India is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BCE (~3500 BCE), and to the early 2nd millennium BCE in China; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions. 　The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting from about 1300 BCE and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BCE, although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times. 　Because historical artworks were often made of brasses (copper and zinc) and bronzes with different compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older artworks increasingly use the generalized term "copper alloy" instead.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword>Sword</a> 

<font size=3>
A sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting. 　Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt and can be straight or curved. 　A thrusting sword tends to have a straighter blade with a pointed tip. 　A slashing sword is more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade. 　Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. 　The precise definition of a sword varies by historical epoch and geographic region. 　Historically, the sword developed in the Bronze Age, evolving from the dagger; the earliest specimens date to about 1600 BC. 　The later Iron Age sword remained fairly short and without a crossguard. 　The spatha, as it developed in the Late Roman army, became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at first adopted as the Migration Period sword, and only in the High Middle Ages, developed into the classical arming sword with crossguard. 　The word sword continues the Old English, sweord. 　The use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or, in a modern context, as fencing. 　In the early modern period, western sword design diverged into two forms, the thrusting swords and the sabres. 　Thrusting swords such as the rapier and eventually the smallsword were designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds. 　Their long and straight yet light and well balanced design made them highly maneuverable and deadly in a duel but fairly ineffective when used in a slashing or chopping motion. 　A well aimed lunge and thrust could end a fight in seconds with just the sword's point, leading to the development of a fighting style which closely resembles modern fencing. 　The sabre and similar blades such as the cutlass were built more heavily and were more typically used in warfare. 　Built for slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often from horseback, the sabre's long curved blade and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly character all its own on the battlefield. 　Most sabres also had sharp points and double-edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier in a cavalry charge. 　Sabres continued to see battlefield use until the early 20th century. 　The US Navy kept tens of thousands of sturdy cutlasses in their armory well into World War II and many were issued to Marines in the Pacific as jungle machetes. 　Non-European weapons classified as swords include single-edged weapons such as the Middle Eastern scimitar, the Chinese Dao and the related Japanese katana. 　The Chinese jiàn 剑 is an example of a non-European double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-edged Iron Age sword.

<font size=3>
A principle is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. 　In law, it is a rule that has to be or usually is to be followed. 　It can be desirably followed, or it can be an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. 　The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored. 　A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's 360/370 Principles of Operation. 　Examples of principles are, entropy in a number of fields, least action in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: doctrines or assumptions forming normative rules of conduct, separation of church and state in statecraft, the central dogma of molecular biology, fairness in ethics, etc. 　In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. 　It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear>Ear</a> 

<font size=3>
An ear is the organ that enables hearing and, in mammals, body balance using the vestibular system. 　In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. 　The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. 　Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word "ear" often refers to the external part alone. 　The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. 　The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. 　The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localization. 　The ear develops from the first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from ectoderm. 　The ear may be affected by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. 　Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear. 　The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewelry in numerous cultures for thousands of years, and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations.

Look up emergency in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　An emergency is an urgent, unexpected, and usually dangerous situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment and requires immediate action. 　Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath. 　While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency. 　The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

In folklore, giants (from Ancient Greek: gigas, cognate giga-) are beings of human-like appearance, but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance. 　The word giant is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester's chronicle. 　It is derived from the Gigantes (Greek: Γίγαντες) of Greek mythology. 　Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted ogres, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. 　The antagonist in Jack and the Beanstalk is often described as a giant. 　In some more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.

Stephen or Steven is a common English first name. 　It is particularly significant to Christians, as it belonged to Saint Stephen (Greek: Στέφανος Stéphanos), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts, was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or "protomartyr") of the Christian Church. 　In English, Stephen is most commonly pronounced as STEEV-ən (/ˈstiːvən/). 　The name, in both the forms Stephen and Steven, is often shortened to Steve or Stevie. 　The spelling as Stephen can also be pronounced /ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən which is from the Greek original version, Stephanos. 　In English, the female version of the name is Stephanie. 　Many surnames are derived from the first name, including Stephens, Stevens, Stephenson, and Stevenson, all of which mean "Stephen's (son)". 　In modern times the name has sometimes been given with intentionally non-standard spelling, such as Stevan or Stevon. 　A common variant of the name used in English is Stephan /ˈstɛfən/; related names that have found some currency or significance in English include Stefan (pronounced /ˈstɛfən/ or /stəˈfɑːn/ in English), Esteban (often pronounced /ˈɛstɪˌbæn/), and the Shakespearean Stephano (/ˈstɛfənoʊ/).

<font size=3>
An adult is a human or other animal that has reached full growth. 　In human context, the term adult has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. 　In contrast to a "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. 　They may also be regarded as a "major". 　The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights, country, and psychological development. 　Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. 　Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior, but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. 　Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character. 　In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. 　This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. 　Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.

<font size=3>
The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland [ˈneːdərlɑnt] (listen)), informally Holland, is a country located in Northwestern Europe with overseas territories in the Caribbean. 　It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 　The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east, and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. 　It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium in the North Sea. 　The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. 　Dutch, English and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories. 　The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. 　Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital. 　The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. 　The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe. 　Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. 　The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. 　It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague. 　Netherlands literally means "lower countries" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with nearly 26% falling below sea level. 　Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. 　In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. 　During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world. 　With a population of 17.7 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 520 people per square kilometre (1,300 people/sq mi). 　Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness. 　The Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. 　The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. 　The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. 　Its mixed-market advanced economy has the thirteenth-highest per capita income globally. 　The Netherlands ranks among the highest in international indices of press freedom, economic freedom, human development and quality of life, as well as happiness.

<font size=3>
A coupling is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power. 　The primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. 　In a more general context, a coupling can also be a mechanical device that serves to connect the ends of adjacent parts or objects. 　Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are torque-limiting couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded. 　Selection, installation and maintenance of couplings can lead to reduced maintenance time and maintenance cost.

<font size=3>
Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 　Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. 　There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. 　Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. 　Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. 　The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. 　Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. 　Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. 　Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. 　Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. 　According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs. 　Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. 　Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. 　The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. 　Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). 　Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. 　They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. 　Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. 　Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. 　Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. 　Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. 　Birds figure throughout human culture. 　About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. 　Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. 　Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory>Factory</a> 

<font size=3>
A factory, manufacturing plant or a production plant is an industrial facility, often a complex consisting of several buildings filled with machinery, where workers manufacture items or operate machines which process each item into another. 　They are a critical part of modern economic production, with the majority of the world's goods being created or processed within factories. 　Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution, when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops. 　Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules, and fewer than a dozen workers have been called "glorified workshops". 　Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. 　Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. 　In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a "Shed". 　Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. 　Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants and may have most of their equipment – tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping – outdoors and operated from control rooms. 　Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors. 　Discrete products may be final goods, or parts and sub-assemblies which are made into final products elsewhere. 　Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials. 　Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity to transform streams of raw materials into finished products. 　The term mill originally referred to the milling of grain, which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century. 　Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing were originally powered by water, the term survives as in steel mill, paper mill, etc.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy>Galaxy</a> 

<font size=3>
A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity. 　The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. 　Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. 　Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. 　Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. 　Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. 　Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. 　The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. 　As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed. 　It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. 　In 2016, using 20 years of images from the Hubble space telescope, it was estimated that there were in total two trillion (2×1012) or more galaxies in the observable universe, and as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars (more stars than all the grains of sand on all beaches of the planet Earth). 　In 2021, data from NASA's New Horizons space probe was used to revise the earlier estimate to roughly 200 billion galaxies (2×1011), Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). 　For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy (with diameter of about 152,000 ly), its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.) The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. 　Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. 　The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy. 　The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. 　At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids. 　Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow>Snow</a> 

<font size=3>
Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. 　It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. 　Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. 　Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. 　Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. 　As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. 　Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. 　Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. 　Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. 　Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. 　In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica. 　Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. 　Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.

<font size=3>
Symmetry (from Ancient Greek: συμμετρία symmetria "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement") in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance. 　In mathematics, "symmetry" has a more precise definition, and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations; including translation, reflection, rotation or scaling. 　Although these two meanings of "symmetry" can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article. 　Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, including theoretic models, language, and music. 　This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in mathematics, including geometry, the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in science and nature; and in the arts, covering architecture, art and music. 　The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry, which refers to the absence or a violation of symmetry.

<font size=3>
A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of a non-rigid container. 　The use of bags predates recorded history, with the earliest bags being lengths of animal skin, cotton, or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material. 　Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the development of human civilization, as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such as berries or food grains, and to transport more items than could readily be carried in the hands. 　The word probably has its origins in the Norse word baggi, from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European bʰak, but is also comparable to the Welsh baich (load, bundle), and the Greek Τσιαντουλίτσα (Chandulícha, load). 　Cheap disposable paper bags and plastic shopping bags are very common varying in size and strength in the retail trade as a convenience for shoppers, and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small fee. 　Customers may also take their own shopping bags to use in shops, these are more commonly known as tote bags or shoppers tote. 　Although, paper had been used for purposes of wrapping and padding in ancient China since the 2nd century BC, the first use of paper bags (for preserving the flavor of tea) in China came during the later Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD).

<font size=3>
Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 　They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). 　Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. 　Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. 　Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. 　The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. 　The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. 　The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.

<font size=3>
Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time (e.g. 60 km/h northbound). 　Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. 　Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. 　The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1). 　For example, "5 metres per second" is a scalar, whereas "5 metres per second east" is a vector. 　If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration.

Rain Typical sound of rain with thunder Problems playing this file? 　See media help. 　Rain is water droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then fall under gravity. 　Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. 　It provides water for hydroelectric power plants, crop irrigation, and suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems. 　The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. 　If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. 　In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. 　On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. 　The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes. 　The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. 　Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics. 　Antarctica is the driest continent. 　The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in). 　Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. 　Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. 　Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar. 　Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water.

Darkness, the direct opposite of lightness, is defined as a lack of illumination, an absence of visible light, or a surface that absorbs light, such as black. 　Human vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance because the hue sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient, in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision. 　The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures, often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling. 　Referring to a time of day, complete darkness occurs when the Sun is more than 18° below the horizon, without the effects of twilight on the night sky.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope>Pope</a> 

<font size=3>
The pope (Latin: papa, from Greek: πάππας, romanized: pappas, lit. 'father'), also known as supreme pontiff (pontifex maximus or summus pontifex), Roman pontiff (Romanus pontifex) or sovereign pontiff, is the bishop of Rome (or historically the patriarch of Rome), head of the worldwide Catholic Church, and has also served as the head of state or sovereign of the Papal States and later the Vatican City State since the eighth century. 　From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of "binding and loosing", naming him as the "rock" upon which the Church would be built. 　The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013. 　While his office is called the papacy, the jurisdiction of the episcopal see is called the Holy See. 　It is the Holy See that is the sovereign entity by international law headquartered in the distinctively independent Vatican City State, a city-state which forms a geographical enclave within the conurbation of Rome, established by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 between Italy and the Holy See to ensure its temporal and spiritual independence. 　The Holy See is recognized by its adherence at various levels to international organizations and by means of its diplomatic relations and political accords with many independent states. 　According to Catholic tradition, the apostolic see of Rome was founded by Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the first century. 　The papacy is one of the most enduring institutions in the world and has had a prominent part in human history. 　In ancient times, the popes helped spread Christianity and intervened to find resolutions in various doctrinal disputes. 　In the Middle Ages, they played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs. 　In addition to the expansion of Christian faith and doctrine, modern popes are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of human rights. 　Over time, the papacy accrued broad secular and political influence, eventually rivaling those of territorial rulers. 　In recent centuries, the temporal authority of the papacy has declined and the office is now largely focused on religious matters. 　By contrast, papal claims of spiritual authority have been increasingly firmly expressed over time, culminating in 1870 with the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for rare occasions when the pope speaks ex cathedra—literally "from the chair (of Saint Peter)"—to issue a formal definition of faith or morals. 　The pope is considered one of the world's most powerful people due to the extensive diplomatic, cultural, and spiritual influence of his position on both 1.3 billion Catholics and those outside the Catholic faith, and because he heads the world's largest non-government provider of education and health care, with a vast network of charities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire>Vampire</a> 

<font size=3>
A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. 　In European folklore, vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. 　They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. 　Vampiric entities have been recorded in cultures around the world; the term vampire was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in Southeastern and Eastern Europe that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism. 　Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as shtriga in Albania, vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania. 　In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra) still persists in some cultures. 　Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. 　Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited. 　The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "The Vampyre" by the English writer John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. 　Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 novel Carmilla. 　The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, television shows, and video games. 　The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.

In road transport, a lane is part of a roadway that is designated to be used by a single line of vehicles to control and guide drivers and reduce traffic conflicts. 　Most public roads (highways) have at least two lanes, one for traffic in each direction, separated by lane markings. 　On multilane roadways and busier two-lane roads, lanes are designated with road surface markings. 　Major highways often have two multi-lane roadways separated by a median. 　Some roads and bridges that carry very low volumes of traffic are less than 4.6 metres (15 ft) wide, and are only a single lane wide. 　Vehicles travelling in opposite directions must slow or stop to pass each other. 　In rural areas, these are often called country lanes. 　In urban areas, alleys are often only one lane wide. 　Urban and suburban one lane roads are often designated for one-way traffic.

<font size=3>
Institutions (singular: institutions) are humanly devised structures of rules and norms that shape and constrain individual behavior. 　All definitions of institutions generally entail that there is a level of persistence and continuity. 　Laws, rules, social conventions and norms are all examples of institutions. 　Institutions vary in their level of formality and informality. 　Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning"). 　Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family or money that are broad enough to encompass sets of related institutions. 　Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement. 　Historians study and document the founding, growth, decay and development of institutions as part of political, economic and cultural history.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery>Artillery</a> 

<font size=3>
Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. 　Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. 　As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use. 　This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.　[citation needed] Originally, the word "artillery" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor. 　Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, "artillery" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars (collectively called barrel artillery, cannon artillery, gun artillery, or—a layman term—tube artillery), and rocket artillery. 　In common speech, the word "artillery" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called "equipment". 　However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses "artillery piece", but most English-speaking armies use "gun" and "mortar". 　The projectiles fired are typically either "shot" (if solid) or "shell" (if not solid). 　Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used. 　"Shell" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions. 　By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines. 　In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility. 　In the 20th century, technology-based target acquisition devices (such as radar) and systems (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged in order to acquire targets, primarily for artillery. 　These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms. 　The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm. 　Artillery has been used since at least the early Industrial Revolution. 　The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery. 　In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was "the god of war".

Conservation refers to a logical thinking ability that allows a person to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size, according to the psychologist Jean Piaget. 　His theory posits that this ability is not present in children during the preoperational stage of their development at ages 2–7 but develops in the concrete operational stage from ages 7–11.

<font size=3>
Chose (pronounced: /ʃoʊz/, French for "thing") is a term used in common law tradition to refer to rights in property, specifically a combined bundle of rights. 　A chose describes the enforcement right which a party possesses in an object. 　The use of chose extends from the English use of French within the courts. 　In English and commonwealth law, all personal things fall into one of two categories, either choses in action or choses in possession. 　English law uses a chose to refer to a bundle of rights, traditionally relating to property which may be utilised in certain circumstances. 　Thus, a chose in action refers to a bundle of personal rights which can only be enforced or claimed by a chose-holder bringing an action through the court to enforce the action. 　In English law, this category is enormously wide. 　This is contrasted with a chose in possession which represents rights which can be enforced or acquired by taking physical possession of the chose. 　This may be, for example a legal mortgage. 　Both choses in possession and choses in action create separate proprietary interests. 　What differs between each is the method in which each chose may be enforced. 　This is dependent on the possessory nature of the reference object. 　Alternative, historical uses includes a chose local, a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill; a chose transitory, something movable that can be carried from place to place.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera>Camera</a> 

<font size=3>
A camera is an optical instrument that captures images. 　Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture 3D images. 　At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed box (the camera body), with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light to pass through and capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film). 　Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to the light. 　The still image camera is a key instrument in the art of photography. 　Captured images may be reproduced later through processes such as digital imaging or photographic printing. 　Similar artistic fields in the moving-image camera domain include film, videography, and cinematography. 　The word camera comes from camera obscura, which is Latin for "dark chamber" and refers to the original device used to project a 2D image onto a flat surface. 　The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. 　The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.

Credit (from Latin verb credit, meaning "one believes") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date. 　The resources provided by the first party can be either property, fulfillment of promises, or performances. 　In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people. 　The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). 　Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment. 　Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.

An accident is an unintended, normally unwanted event that was not directly caused by humans. 　The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks. 　Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity. 　For example, when a tree falls down during a wind storm, its fall may not have been caused by humans, but the tree's type, size, health, location, or improper maintenance may have contributed to the result. 　Most car wrecks are not true accidents; however English speakers started using that word in the mid-20th century as a result of media manipulation by the US automobile industry.

Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. 　Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). 　Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer. 　Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. 　There are many digital art programs and devices. 　A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. 　The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. 　Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. 　Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. 　It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. 　The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities. 　In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. 　A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. 　An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.
