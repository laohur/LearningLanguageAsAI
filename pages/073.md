## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen>Oxygen</a> 
<font size=3>
Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. 　It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. 　Oxygen is Earth's most abundant element, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe. 　At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 2. 　Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. 　Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides. 　All plants, animals, and fungus need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy by the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. 　In vetabrate animals breathing brings oxygen into the lungs where gas exchange takes place, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood, and oxygen diffuses into the blood. 　The body's circulatory system transports the oxygen the cells, where cellular respiration takes place. 　Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. 　Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. 　Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. 　Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. 　Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O 3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. 　However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant. 　Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. 　Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. 　Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. 　The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion. 　Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.

<font size=3>
Dawn is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise. 　It is recognized by the appearance of indirect sunlight being scattered in Earth's atmosphere, when the centre of the Sun's disc has reached 18° below the observer's horizon. 　This morning twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), when direct sunlight outshines the diffused light.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster>Disaster</a> 
<font size=3>
A disaster is a serious problem occurring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. 　Disasters are routinely divided into either "natural disasters" caused by natural hazards or "human-instigated disasters" caused from anthropogenic hazards. 　However, in modern times, the divide between natural, human-made and human-accelerated disasters is difficult to draw. 　Examples of natural hazards include avalanches, flooding, cold waves and heat waves, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, lightning, tsunamis, volcanic activity, wildfires, and winter precipitation. 　Examples of anthropogenic hazards include criminality, civil disorder, terrorism, war, industrial hazards, engineering hazards, power outages, fire, hazards caused by transportation, and environmental hazards. 　Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95% of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of gross domestic product) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper>Copper</a> 
<font size=3>
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. 　It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. 　A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. 　Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement. 　Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals). 　This led to very early human use in several regions, from circa 8000 BC. 　Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, circa 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 　4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 　3500 BC. 　In the Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal, from aes cyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to cuprum (Latin). 　Coper (Old English) and copper were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530. 　Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. 　Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). 　Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. 　Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives. 　Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. 　In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. 　In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. 　The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat>Fat</a> 
<font size=3>
In nutrition, biology, and chemistry, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds, most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food. 　The term often refers specifically to triglycerides (triple esters of glycerol), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals; or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. 　The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipid—any substance of biological relevance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that is insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. 　In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids (such as lecithin), sterols (such as cholesterol), waxes (such as beeswax), and free fatty acids, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts. 　Fats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet, along with carbohydrates and proteins, and the main components of common food products like milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt pork, and cooking oils. 　They are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions, in most living beings, including energy storage, waterproofing, and thermal insulation. 　The human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. 　Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.

<font size=3>
Germans (German: Deutsche, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃə] (listen)) are the natives or inhabitants of Germany, and sometimes more broadly any people who are of German descent or native speakers of the German language. 　The constitution of Germany defines a German as a German citizen. 　During the 19th and much of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture, descent, and history. 　Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary, though not exclusive, criterion of German identity. 　Estimates on the total number of Germans in the world range from 100 to 150 million, and most of them live in Germany. 　The history of Germans as an ethnic group began with the separation of a distinct Kingdom of Germany from the eastern part of the Frankish Empire under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th century, forming the core of the Holy Roman Empire. 　In subsequent centuries the political power and population of this empire grew considerably. 　It expanded eastwards, and eventually a substantial number of Germans migrated further eastwards into Eastern Europe. 　The empire itself was politically divided between many small princedoms, cities and bishoprics. 　Following the Reformation in the 16th century, many of these states found themselves in bitter conflict concerning the rise of Protestantism. 　The 19th century saw the dismemberment of the Holy Roman Empire and the growth of German nationalism. 　The kingdom of Prussia incorporated most of the Germans into its German Empire in 1871, while a substantial number of Germans also inhabited the multiethnic kingdom of Austria-Hungary. 　During this time a large number of Germans emigrated to the New World, particularly to the United States, Canada and Brazil, as well as establishing prominent communities in New Zealand and Australia. 　The Russian Empire also contained a substantial German population. 　In the aftermath of World War I, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire were partitioned, resulting in many Germans becoming ethnic minorities in newly established countries. 　In the chaotic years that followed, Adolf Hitler became the dictator of Nazi Germany and embarked on a genocidal campaign to unify all Germans under his leadership. 　This endeavour resulted in World War II and the Holocaust. 　In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in the war, the country was occupied and partitioned. 　Millions of Germans were expelled from Eastern Europe. 　In 1990, the states of West and East Germany were reunified. 　In modern times, remembrance of the Holocaust has become an integral part of German identity (Erinnerungskulturcode: deu promoted to code: de ). 　Owing to their long history of political fragmentation, the Germans are culturally diverse and often have strong regional identities. 　The arts and sciences are an integral part of German culture, and the Germans have produced a large number of prominent personalities in a number of disciplines.

<font size=3>
Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. 　Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. 　It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. 　Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. 　As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. 　Ψ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived (see below), is commonly associated with the science. 　A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. 　Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. 　Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. 　Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. 　Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. 　Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. 　They also consider the unconscious mind. 　Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. 　Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation. 　While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. 　By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. 　Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. 　Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. 　Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). 　Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. 　Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.

A voivodeship (/ˈvɔɪˌvoʊdˌʃɪp/) or voivodate is the area administered by a voivode (Governor) in several countries of central and eastern Europe. 　Voivodeships have existed since medieval times and the area of extent of voivodeship resembles that of a duchy in western medieval states, much as the title of voivode was equivalent to that of a duke. 　Other roughly equivalent titles and areas in medieval Eastern Europe included ban (bojan, vojin or bayan) and banate. 　In a modern context, the word normally refers to one of the provinces (województwa) of Poland. 　As of 2022[update], Poland has 16 voivodeships.

Finland (Finnish: Suomi [ˈsuo̯mi] (listen); Swedish: Finland [ˈfɪ̌nland] (listen)), officially the Republic of Finland (Finnish: Suomen tasavalta; Swedish: Republiken Finland (listen to all)), is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. 　It shares land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south, across from Estonia. 　Finland covers an area of 338,455 square kilometres (130,678 sq mi) with a population of 5.6 million. 　Helsinki is the capital and largest city. 　The vast majority of the population are ethnic Finns. 　Finnish and Swedish are the official languages, Swedish is the native language of 5.2% of the population. 　Finland's climate varies from humid continental in the south to the boreal in the north. 　The land cover is primarily a boreal forest biome, with more than 180,000 recorded lakes. 　Finland was first inhabited around 9000 BC after the Last Glacial Period. 　The Stone Age introduced several different ceramic styles and cultures. 　The Bronze Age and Iron Age were characterized by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region. 　From the late 13th century, Finland became a part of Sweden as a consequence of the Northern Crusades. 　In 1809, as a result of the Finnish War, Finland became part of the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, during which Finnish art flourished and the idea of independence began to take hold. 　In 1906, Finland became the first European state to grant universal suffrage, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office. 　After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland declared independence from Russia. 　In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by the Finnish Civil War. 　During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War, and Nazi Germany in the Lapland War. 　It subsequently lost parts of its territory, but maintained its independence. 　Finland largely remained an agrarian country until the 1950s. 　After World War II, it rapidly industrialized and developed an advanced economy, while building an extensive welfare state based on the Nordic model; the country soon enjoyed widespread prosperity and a high per capita income. 　During the Cold War, Finland adopted an official policy of neutrality. 　Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and the Eurozone at its inception in 1999. 　Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life and human development. 　In 2015, Finland ranked first in the World Human Capital, topped the Press Freedom Index, and was the most stable country in the world during 2011–2016, according to the Fragile States Index; it is second in the Global Gender Gap Report, and has ranked first in every annual World Happiness Report since 2018.

<font size=3>
Eve (/ˈiːv/; Hebrew: חַוָּה‎‎, Modern: Ḥava, Tiberian: Ḥawwā; Arabic: حَوَّاء, romanized: Ḥawwāʾ; Greek: Εὕα, romanized: Heúa; Latin: Eva, Heva; Syriac: ܚܰܘܳܐ romanized: ḥawâ) is a figure in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. 　According to the origin story of the Abrahamic religions, she was the first woman, yet some debate within Judaism has also given that position to Lilith. 　Eve is known also as Adam's wife. 　According to the second chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. 　Adam is charged with guarding and keeping the garden before her creation; she is not present when God commands Adam not to eat the forbidden fruit – although it is clear that she was aware of the command. 　She decides to eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after she hears the serpent's argument that it would not kill her but bring her benefits. 　She shares the fruit with Adam, and before they could eat of the tree of life, they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. 　Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. 　Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a different level of responsibility for the "fall." 　The Catholic Church by ancient tradition recognizes Eve as a saint, alongside Adam, and the traditional liturgical feast of Saints Adam and Eve has been celebrated on 24 December since the Middle Ages in many European nations, including Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Scandinavian nations.

<font size=3>
A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, swimming, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. 　The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and recreational activities. 　A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. 　Some resorts are also condominium complexes that are timeshares or owned fractionally or wholly owned condominium. 　A resort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late 20th century, that sort of facility became more common. 　In British English, "resort" means a town which people visit for holidays and days out which usually contains hotels at which such holidaymakers stay. 　Examples would include Blackpool and Brighton.
