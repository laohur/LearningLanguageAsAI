## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province>Province</a> 
<font size=3>
A province is almost always an administrative division within a country or state. 　The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia, which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. 　The term province has since been adopted by many countries. 　In some countries with no actual provinces, "the provinces" is a metaphorical term meaning "outside the capital city". 　While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. 　Many have their own powers independent of central or federal authority, especially in Canada and Pakistan. 　In other countries, like China or France, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence>Evidence</a> 
<font size=3>
Evidence for a proposition is what supports this proposition. 　It is usually understood as an indication that the supported proposition is true. 　What role evidence plays and how it is conceived varies from field to field. 　In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what makes it rational to hold a certain doxastic attitude. 　For example, a perceptual experience of a tree may act as evidence that justifies the belief that there is a tree. 　In this role, evidence is usually understood as a private mental state. 　Important topics in this field include the questions of what the nature of these mental states is, for example, whether they have to be propositional, and whether misleading mental states can still qualify as evidence. 　In phenomenology, evidence is understood in a similar sense. 　Here, however, it is limited to intuitive knowledge that provides immediate access to truth and is therefore indubitable. 　In this role, it is supposed to provide ultimate justifications for basic philosophical principles and thus turn philosophy into a rigorous science. 　However, it is highly controversial whether evidence can meet these requirements. 　Other fields, including the sciences and the law, tend to emphasize more the public nature of evidence (for example, scientists tend to focus on how the data used during statistical inference are generated). 　In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which confirms or disconfirms scientific hypotheses. 　Measurements of Mercury's "anomalous" orbit, for example, are seen as evidence that confirms Einstein's theory of general relativity. 　In order to play the role of neutral arbiter between competing theories, it is important that scientific evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events, so that the proponents of the different theories can agree on what the evidence is. 　This is ensured by following the scientific method and tends to lead to an emerging scientific consensus through the gradual accumulation of evidence. 　Two issues for the scientific conception of evidence are the problem of underdetermination, i.e. that the available evidence may support competing theories equally well, and theory-ladenness, i.e. that what some scientists consider the evidence to be may already involve various theoretical assumptions not shared by other scientists. 　It is often held that there are two kinds of evidence: intellectual evidence or what is self-evident and empirical evidence or evidence accessible through the senses. 　In order for something to act as evidence for a hypothesis, it has to stand in the right relation to it. 　In philosophy, this is referred to as the "evidential relation" and there are competing theories about what this relation has to be like. 　Probabilistic approaches hold that something counts as evidence if it increases the probability of the supported hypothesis. 　According to hypothetico-deductivism, evidence consists in observational consequences of the hypothesis. 　The positive-instance approach states that an observation sentence is evidence for a universal hypothesis if the sentence describes a positive instance of this hypothesis. 　The evidential relation can occur in various degrees of strength. 　These degrees range from direct proof of the truth of a hypothesis to weak evidence that is merely consistent with the hypothesis but does not rule out other, competing hypotheses, as in circumstantial evidence. 　In law, rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. 　Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. 　The parts of a legal case that are not in controversy are known, in general, as the "facts of the case." 　Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. 　Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. 　Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.

<font size=3>
A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. 　Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. 　Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization and science. 　After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth. 　Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce. 　The word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged. 　As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons. 　Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. 　The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE

Kept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man. 　The show premiered on the American cable network VH1 in late May 2005. 　When Hall narrowed the list down to twelve, she spirited them off to London and eliminated them one by one. 　The final three consisted of Anwar, Austen and Seth. 　In the August 4 finale, Hall was torn between Austen and Seth but ultimately chose Seth as he knew how to have fun and she thought he had matured throughout the process. 　Seth claims that he got his $100,000 in prize money but after filming stopped he never saw Jerry, the penthouse apartment, or the Lamborghini again.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management>Management</a> 
<font size=3>
Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a nonprofit organization, or a government body. 　It is the art and science of managing resources of the business. 　Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. 　"Run the business" and "Change the business" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend. 　The term "management" may also refer to those people who manage an organization—managers. 　Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management includes the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.), Master of Business Administration (MBA.), Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree. 　Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. 　In the past few decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management. 　Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure: Senior managers such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization sets the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. 　Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management, and directly or indirectly report to them. 　Middle managers such as branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to the front-line managers. 　They communicate the strategic goals and policy of senior management to the front-line managers. 　Line managers such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work. 　Line managers often perform the managerial functions that are traditionally considered as the core of management. 　Despite the name, they are usually considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization's management class. 　In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization. 　Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership.

In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. 　The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or "lower" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand. 　By anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, is considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. 　The Latin term brachium, which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper limb as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.

Attention in psychology is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of other stimuli. 　A process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective. 　William James (1890) wrote that "Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence." 　Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. 　Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness. 　Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. 　Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes, which may include working memory and psychological vigilance. 　A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury and its effects on attention. 　Attention also varies across cultures. 　The relationships between attention and consciousness are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration. 　Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from mental health and the study of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and its domains of research.

<font size=3>
A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. 　A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. 　A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases. 　A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. 　In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources. 　Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. 　The library's clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library, for example. 　Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. 　Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet. 　The services that libraries offer are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.

<font size=3>
In molecular biology, a library is a collection of DNA fragments that is stored and propagated in a population of micro-organisms through the process of molecular cloning. 　There are different types of DNA libraries, including cDNA libraries (formed from reverse-transcribed RNA), genomic libraries (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated). 　DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, genetic engineering, and protein engineering, and the applications of these libraries depend on the source of the original DNA fragments. 　There are differences in the cloning vectors and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of bacteria (a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert). 　As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, "cloned").

<font size=3>
Length is a measure of distance. 　In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. 　In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. 　In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre. 　Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. 　However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in. 　Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. 　Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. 　Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. 　Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object. 　Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason>Reason</a> 
<font size=3>
Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. 　It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. 　Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality. 　Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. 　The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. 　Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. 　Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. 　In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. 　For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks. 　Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. 　For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. 　Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination. 　In contrast to the use of "reason" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. 　Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals. 　Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. 　For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does." 　Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. 　The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. 　Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic>Republic</a> 
<font size=3>
A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a "state in which power rests with the people or their representatives; specifically a state without a monarchy" and also a "government, or system of government, of such a state." 　Previously, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term was used to imply a state with a democratic or representative constitution (constitutional republic), but more recently it has also been used of autocratic or dictatorial states not ruled by a monarch. 　It is now chiefly used to denote any non-monarchical state headed by an elected or appointed president. 　As of 2017[update], 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official names. 　Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word "republic" used in the names of all states with elected governments. 　The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means "public thing", "public matter", or "public affair" and was used to refer to the state as a whole. 　The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BCE. 　This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority. 　Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. 　For instance, the United States Constitution "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government". 　Another example was the Soviet Union, described by its authoritarian and extremely centralised government as being a federation of voluntarily united "Soviet socialist republics" with equal rights and an ostensibly high degree of internal autonomy. 　The Russian Federation is similarly a state that is composed partly of several "republics".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing>Writing</a> 
<font size=3>
Writing is a neuropsychological activity involving cognitive and physical processes and the use of writing systems to structure and translate human thoughts into persistent representations of human language. 　A system of writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the language it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols representing that language's phonology and morphology. 　Nevertheless, written language may take on characteristics distinctive from any available in spoken language. 　The outcome of this activity, also called "writing", and sometimes a "text", is a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented linguistic symbols. 　The interpreter or activator of a text is called a "reader". 　Writing systems do not themselves constitute languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages); they are a means of rendering language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space. 　While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries or other public records). 　Writing can also have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise.

<font size=3>
A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath. 　It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. 　There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. 　Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it. 　The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones. 　The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. 　The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition>Competition</a> 
<font size=3>
Competition is a rivalry where two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game). 　Competition can arise between entities such as organisms, individuals, economic and social groups, etc. 　The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition: Competition occurs in nature, between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. 　Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. 　Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment. 　Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. 　Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop. 　Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. 　In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued "the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system. The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players". 　Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory. 　Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. 　Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition. 　They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. 　They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. 　Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. 　Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. 　They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

<font size=3>
Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both require a resource that is in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). 　Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved since the presence of one of the organisms always reduces the amount of the resource available to the other. 　In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species is an important biological interaction. 　Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure, species diversity, and population dynamics (shifts in a population over time). 　There are three major mechanisms of competition: interference, exploitation, and apparent competition (in order from most direct to least direct). 　Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, but instead share a predator. 　Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. 　According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources must either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. 　According to evolutionary theory, competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. 　More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven not by competition between organisms, but by these animals adapting to colonize empty livable space; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.
