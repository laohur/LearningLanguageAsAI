<font size=3>
In economics, goods are items that satisfy human wants and provide utility, for example, to a consumer making a purchase of a satisfying product. 　A common distinction is made between goods which are transferable, and services, which are not transferable. 　A good is an "economic good" if it is useful to people but scarce in relation to its demand so that human effort is required to obtain it. 　In contrast, free goods, such as air, are naturally in abundant supply and need no conscious effort to obtain them. 　Private goods are things owned by people, such as televisions, living room furniture, wallets, cellular telephones, almost anything owned or used on a daily basis that is not food-related. 　A consumer good or "final good" is any item that is ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. 　For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. 　For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods. 　Commercial goods are construed as tangible products that are manufactured and then made available for supply to be used in an industry of commerce. 　Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes, and even roofing materials. 　Commercial and personal goods as categories are very broad and cover almost everything a person sees from the time they wake up in their home, on their commute to work to their arrival at the workplace. 　Commodities may be used as a synonym for economic goods but often refer to marketable raw materials and primary products. 　Although common goods are tangible, certain classes of goods, such as information, only take intangible forms. 　For example, among other goods an apple is a tangible object, while news belongs to an intangible class of goods and can be perceived only by means of an instrument such as printers or television.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud>Cloud</a> 
<font size=3>
In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. 　Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. 　On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. 　Clouds are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. 　Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. 　There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name. 　Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. 　It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera. 　The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform. 　Low-level clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. 　However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. 　In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing. 　Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes. 　They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical. 　Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. 　Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names. 　In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. 　They may have the appearance of stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. 　They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. 　Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. 　However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water. 　Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth. 　They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect. 　The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere. 　Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. 　Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability>Probability</a> 
<font size=3>
Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. 　The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. 　The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. 　A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. 　Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%). 　These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. 　Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.

<font size=3>
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good, that involves the enjoyment of something. 　It contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling bad. 　It is closely related to value, desire and action: humans and other conscious animals find pleasure enjoyable, positive or worthy of seeking. 　A great variety of activities may be experienced as pleasurable, like eating, having sex, listening to music or playing games. 　Pleasure is part of various other mental states such as ecstasy, euphoria and flow. 　Happiness and well-being are closely related to pleasure but not identical with it. 　There is no general agreement as to whether pleasure should be understood as a sensation, a quality of experiences, an attitude to experiences or otherwise. 　Pleasure plays a central role in the family of philosophical theories known as hedonism.

An aside is a dramatic device in which a character speaks to the audience. 　By convention, the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. 　It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. 　An aside is usually a brief comment, rather than a speech, such as a monologue or soliloquy. 　Unlike a public contains an early use of character aside. 　More recently, it was used by Ian Richardson's character Francis Urquhart in the 1990 BBC mini-series House of Cards, as well as by Kevin Spacey's character Frank Underwood in the 2013 Netflix original series of the same name. 　It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character's plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect. 　It was also used by Michaela Coel’s character Tracey in the Channel 4 comedy series Chewing Gum; and by the titular character in Fleabag, written and played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. 　==

<font size=3>
Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms. 　Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields.　[page needed] For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law. 　An extremely important definition of income is Haig–Simons income, which defines income as Consumption + Change in net worth and is widely used in economics. 　For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year. 　Discretionary income is often defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers. 　In the field of public economics, the concept may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability, with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income. 　For a firm, gross income can be defined as sum of all revenue minus the cost of goods sold. 　Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation, interest, and taxes.

A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work. 　The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy, such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). 　The heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine. 　Other times, the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion. 　Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. 　Hydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized. 　Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).

Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. 　A person who sings is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music). 　Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. 　Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. 　Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. 　Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Japanese music, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal, and popular music styles such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music. 　Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. 　It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. 　Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. 　If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. 　Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). 　Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers

A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design and colours. 　It is used as a symbol, a signalling device, or for decoration. 　The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the maritime environment, where semaphore is used). 　Many flags fall into groups of similar designs called flag families. 　The study of flags is known as "vexillology" from the Latin vexillumcode: lat promoted to code: la , meaning "flag" or "banner". 　National flags are patriotic symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong military associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. 　Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for decorative purposes. 　Some military units are called "flags" after their use of flags. 　A flag (Arabic: لواءcode: ara promoted to code: ar ) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries. 　In Spain, a flag (Spanish: banderacode: spa promoted to code: es ) is a battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion.

<font size=3>
In molecular cloning, a vector is any particle (e.g., plasmids, cosmids, Lambda phages) used as a vehicle to artificially carry a foreign nucleic sequence – usually DNA – into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed. 　A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. 　The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. 　Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. 　Common to all engineered vectors have an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker. 　The vector itself generally carries a DNA sequence that consists of an insert (in this case the transgene) and a larger sequence that serves as the "backbone" of the vector. 　The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell. 　All vectors may be used for cloning and are therefore cloning vectors, but there are also vectors designed specially for cloning, while others may be designed specifically for other purposes, such as transcription and protein expression. 　Vectors designed specifically for the expression of the transgene in the target cell are called expression vectors, and generally have a promoter sequence that drives expression of the transgene. 　Simpler vectors called transcription vectors are only capable of being transcribed but not translated: they can be replicated in a target cell but not expressed, unlike expression vectors. 　Transcription vectors are used to amplify their insert. 　The manipulation of DNA is normally conducted on E. coli vectors, which contain elements necessary for their maintenance in E. coli. 　However, vectors may also have elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism such as yeast, plant or mammalian cells, and these vectors are called shuttle vectors. 　Such vectors have bacterial or viral elements which may be transferred to the non-bacterial host organism, however other vectors termed intragenic vectors have also been developed to avoid the transfer of any genetic material from an alien species. 　Insertion of a vector into the target cell is usually called transformation for bacterial cells, transfection for eukaryotic cells, although insertion of a viral vector is often called transduction.

Coordinates: 32°N 53°E﻿ / ﻿32°N 53°E﻿ / 32; 53 You may need rendering support to display the Persian text in this article correctly. 　Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, and also called Persia, is a country located in Western Asia. 　It is bordered by Iraq and Turkey to the west, by Azerbaijan and Armenia to the northwest, by the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan to the north, by Afghanistan and Pakistan to the east, and by the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. 　It covers an area of 1.64 million square kilometres (0.63 million square miles), making it the 17th-largest country. 　Iran has an estimated population of 86.8 million, making it the 17th-most populous country in the world, and the second-largest in the Middle East. 　Its largest cities, in descending order, are the capital Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz, and Tabriz. 　The country is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. 　It was first unified by the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Persian Empire, which became one of the largest empires in history and a superpower. 　The Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was subsequently divided into several Hellenistic states. 　An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sassanid Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries. 　Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran. 　It subsequently became a major center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age. 　Over the next two centuries, a series of native Iranian Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuk Turks and the Mongols conquered the region. 　In the 15th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity, and converted the country to Shia Islam. 　Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran presided over the most powerful military in the world, though by the 19th century, a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses. 　The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution. 　Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence. 　He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963. 　After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first Supreme Leader. 　The government of Iran is an Islamic theocracy that includes some elements of a presidential system, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic "Supreme Leader"; a position held by Ali Khamenei since Khomeini's death in 1989. 　The Iranian government is authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant constraints and abuses against human rights and civil liberties, including several violent suppressions of mass protests, unfair elections, and limited rights for women and for children. 　It is also a focal point for Shia Islam within the Middle East, countering the long-existing Arab and Sunni hegemony within the region. 　Since the Iranian Revolution, the country is widely considered to be the largest adversary of Israel and also of Saudi Arabia. 　Iran is also considered to be one of the biggest players within Middle Eastern affairs, with its government being involved both directly and indirectly in the majority of modern Middle Eastern conflicts. 　Iran is a regional and middle power, with a geopolitically strategic location in the Asian continent. 　It is a founding member of the United Nations, the ECO, the OIC, and the OPEC. 　It has large reserves of fossil fuels—including the second-largest natural gas supply and the third-largest proven oil reserves. 　The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　Historically a multi-ethnic country, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, with the largest of these being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis, and Lurs.

Beauty is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes these objects pleasurable to perceive. 　Such objects include landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. 　Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. 　As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart. 　One difficulty in understanding beauty is because it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. 　Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be "in the eye of the beholder". 　It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the "sense of taste", can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. 　This would suggest that the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are intersubjective, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully subjective or fully objective. 　Conceptions of beauty aim to capture what is essential to all beautiful things. 　Classical conceptions define beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. 　Hedonist conceptions see a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. 　Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude towards them or of their function.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral>Cathedral</a> 
<font size=3>
A cathedral is a church that contains the cathedra (Latin for 'seat') of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. 　Churches with the function of "cathedral" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and some Lutheran churches. 　Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appeared in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures, and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches, and episcopal residences. 　The cathedral is more important in the hierarchy than the church because it is from the cathedral that the bishop governs the area under his or her administrative authority. 　Following the Protestant Reformation, the Christian church in several parts of Western Europe, such as Scotland, the Netherlands, certain Swiss Cantons and parts of Germany, adopted a presbyterian polity that did away with bishops altogether. 　Where ancient cathedral buildings in these lands are still in use for congregational worship, they generally retain the title and dignity of "cathedral", maintaining and developing distinct cathedral functions, but void of hierarchical supremacy. 　From the 16th century onwards, but especially since the 19th century, churches originating in Western Europe have undertaken vigorous programmes of missionary activity, leading to the founding of large numbers of new dioceses with associated cathedral establishments of varying forms in Asia, Africa, Australasia, Oceania and the Americas. 　In addition, both the Catholic Church and Orthodox churches have formed new dioceses within formerly Protestant lands for converts and migrant co-religionists. 　Consequently, it is not uncommon to find Christians in a single city being served by three or more cathedrals of differing denominations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl>Bowl</a> 
<font size=3>
A bowl is a typically round dish or container generally used for preparing, serving, or consuming food. 　The interior of a bowl is characteristically shaped like a spherical cap, with the edges and the bottom forming a seamless curve. 　This makes bowls especially suited for holding liquids and loose food, as the contents of the bowl are naturally concentrated in its center by the force of gravity. 　The exterior of a bowl is most often round but can be of any shape, including rectangular. 　The size of bowls varies from small bowls used to hold a single serving of food to large bowls, such as punch bowls or salad bowls, that are often used to hold or store more than one portion of food. 　There is some overlap between bowls, cups, and plates. 　Very small bowls, such as the tea bowl, are often called cups, while plates with especially deep wells are often called bowls. 　In many cultures bowls are the most common kind of vessel used for serving and eating food. 　Historically small bowls were also used for serving both tea and alcoholic drinks. 　In Western culture plates and cups are more commonly used.

<font size=3>
A threat is a communication of intent to inflict harm or loss on another person. 　Intimidation is a tactic used between conflicting parties to make the other timid or psychologically insecure for coercion or control. 　The act of intimidation for coercion is considered as a threat. 　Threatening or threatening behavior (or criminal threatening behavior) is the crime of intentionally or knowingly putting another person in fear of bodily injury. 　"Threat of harm generally involves a perception of injury...physical or mental damage...act or instance of injury, or a material and detriment or loss to a person." 　Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against their will. 　In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation.

<font size=3>
Lyrics are words that make up a song, usually consisting of verses and choruses. 　The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. 　The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a "libretto" and their writer, as a "librettist". 　The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. 　Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. 　Rappers can also create lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung.
