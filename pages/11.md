## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin>Cousin</a> 

<font size=3>
Most generally, in the lineal kinship system used in the English-speaking world, a cousin is a type of familial relationship in which two relatives are two or more familial generations away from their most recent common ancestor. 　Commonly, "cousin" refers to a first cousin – a relative of the same generation whose most recent common ancestor with the subject is a grandparent. 　Degrees and removals are separate measures used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins. 　Degree measures the separation, in generations, from the most recent common ancestor(s) to a parent of one of the cousins (whichever is closest), while removal measures the difference in generations between the cousins themselves, relative to their most recent common ancestor(s). 　To illustrate usage, a second cousin is a cousin with a degree of two; there are three (not two) generations from the common ancestor(s). 　When the degree is not specified, first cousin is assumed. 　A cousin "once removed" is a cousin with one removal. 　When the removal is not specified, no removal is assumed. 　Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past; for example, in medicine and in law, a first cousin is a type of third-degree relative.　[citation needed]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan>Loan</a> 

<font size=3>
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. 　The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. 　The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and the date of repayment. 　A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. 　The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. 　In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. 　Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent. 　Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. 　For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

<font size=3>
Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events. 　In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind. 　The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. 　In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. 　However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. 　Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. 　Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. 　Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. 　Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). 　This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. 　The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology. 　Measurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.

A reign is the period of a person's or dynasty's occupation of the office of monarch of a nation (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Andorra), of a people (e.g., the Franks, the Zulus) or of a spiritual community (e.g., Catholicism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nizari Ismailism). 　In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g., Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. 　Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. 　In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office (e.g., Malaysia). 　The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation "r." (for Latin rexit) after a sovereign's name, such as the following: George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India (r. 1936–1952)

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland>Switzerland</a> 

<font size=3>
Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country located at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. 　It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. 　Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas the Swiss population of approximately 8.7 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel. 　Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. 　The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. 　Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality. 　Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. 　Switzerland has not fought an international war since 1815. 　It joined the United Nations only in 2002, though it pursues an active foreign policy, including participation in frequent peace-building processes worldwide. 　Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best-known humanitarian organisations, and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, FIFA, and the United Nations. 　It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but not part of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, or the Eurozone; however, it participates in the European single market and the Schengen Area through bilateral treaties. 　Switzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern. 　It has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. 　Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. 　This identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnationcode: deu promoted to code: de ("nation of volition") rather than a nation state. 　Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by multiple native names: Schweizcode: deu promoted to code: de [ˈʃvaɪts] (German); Suisse [sɥis(ə)] audio (help·info) (French); Svizzeracode: ita promoted to code: it [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizracode: roh promoted to code: rm [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh). 　On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la — frequently shortened to "Helvetia" — is used instead of the spoken languages. 　Switzerland is one of the world's most developed countries. 　It has the highest nominal wealth per adult of any country and the eighth-highest gross domestic product per capita. 　Switzerland ranks first in the Human Development Index since 2021 and performs highly also on several international metrics, including economic competitiveness and democratic governance. 　Cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality of life, albeit with some of the highest costs of living.

A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface water or underground streams. 　Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. 　Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. 　A dam can also be used to collect or store water which can be evenly distributed between locations. 　Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. 　The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, dating to 3,000 BC. 　The word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities, such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

A ridge or a mountain ridge is a geographical feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for an extended amount of distance. 　The sides of the ridge slope away from the narrow top on either side. 　The lines along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, are called the ridgelines. 　Ridges are usually termed hills or mountains as well, depending on their size. 　Smaller ridges, especially those leaving a larger ridge, are often called to as spurs.

<font size=3>
A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. 　An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. 　Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. 　In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging money, goods, etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. 　Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. 　By extension the term gift can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness. 　Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

<font size=3>
Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country in Southeast Europe. 　It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. 　Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. 　The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. 　Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. 　The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.4 million. 　Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras. 　Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. 　From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 　Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. 　The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. 　Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. 　The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. 　After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. 　The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　Greece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy, and a high quality of life, ranking 32nd in the Human Development Index. 　Its economy is among the largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. 　A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. 　It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, and the OSCE. 　Greece has a unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, and prominent shipping sector.

<font size=3>
In mathematical morphology, the closing of a set (binary image) A by a structuring element B is the erosion of the dilation of that set, A ∙ B = ( A ⊕ B ) ⊖ B , {\displaystyle A\bullet B=(A\oplus B)\ominus B,\,} where ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } and ⊖ {\displaystyle \ominus } denote the dilation and erosion, respectively. 　In image processing, closing is, together with opening, the basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. 　Opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.

<font size=3>
Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. 　These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry, and analysis, respectively. 　There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline. 　Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. 　These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. 　A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. 　These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration. 　Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. 　Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. 　Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. 　Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications. 　The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks. 　Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. 　Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. 　Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both. 　At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. 　The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.

<font size=3>
In biology, a tribe is a taxonomic rank above genus, but below family and subfamily. 　It is sometimes subdivided into subtribes. 　By convention, all taxonomic ranks from genus upwards are capitalized, including both tribe and subtribe. 　In zoology, the standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is "-ini". 　Examples include the tribes Caprini (goat-antelopes), Hominini (hominins), Bombini (bumblebees), and Thunnini (tunas). 　The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe Hominina then comprises "humans". 　The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is "-ina". 　In botany, the standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is "-eae". 　Examples include the tribes Acalypheae and Hyacintheae. 　The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae. 　The standard ending for the name of a botanical subtribe is "-inae". 　In bacteriology, the form of tribe names is as in botany, e.g., Pseudomonadeae, based on the genus name Pseudomonas.

<font size=3>
The term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. 　The predominant worldwide usage of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. 　Its definition is contested, in part due to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. 　The concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state. 　These terms are equally disputed. 　In some cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions. 　In the United States, Native American tribes are legally considered to have "domestic dependent nation" status within the territorial United States, with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government.

<font size=3>
A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or man-made features, often considered in terms of their aesthetic appeal. 　A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. 　Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity. 　The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. 　It is the dynamic backdrop to people's lives. 　Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness. 　The Earth has a vast range of landscapes including the icy landscapes of polar regions, mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands, and coastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal forests and tropical rainforests and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions. 　The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as landscaping.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth>Commonwealth</a> 

<font size=3>
A commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. 　Historically, it has been synonymous with "republic". 　The noun "commonwealth", meaning "public welfare, general good or advantage", dates from the 15th century. 　Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common wealth – echoed in the modern synonym "public wealth"), it comes from the old meaning of "wealth", which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica (republic). 　The term literally meant "common well-being". 　In the 17th century, the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "public welfare" or "commonweal" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state". 　The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. 　Three countries – Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica – have the official title "Commonwealth", as do four U.S. states and two U.S. territories. 　Since the early 20th century, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of states, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation primarily of former territories of the British Empire. 　The organisation is not to be confused with the realms of the Commonwealth.

<font size=3>
Manufacturing is the creation or production of goods with the help of equipment, labor, machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. 　It is the essence of the secondary sector of the economy. 　The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from the primary sector are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. 　Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers). 　Manufacturing engineering is the field of engineering that designs and optimizes the manufacturing process, or the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. 　The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification. 　These materials are then modified through manufacturing to become the desired product. 　Modern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes involved in the production and integration of a product's components. 　Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers, use the term fabrication instead. 　The manufacturing sector is closely connected with the engineering and industrial design industries.

<font size=3>
A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. 　Hats which incorporate mechanical features, such as visors, spikes, flaps, braces or beer holders shade into the broader category of headgear. 　In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. 　In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. 　Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 　Some hats have a protective function. 　As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. 　Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. 　Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs, or the mitre worn by Christian bishops. 　Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the turban worn by Sikhs, or the church hat that is worn as a headcovering by Christian women during prayer and worship.

A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. 　Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. 　Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. 　Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian, and avian features. 　Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

<font size=3>
A hero (feminine: heroine) is a real person or a main fictional character who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or strength. 　Like other formerly gender-specific terms (like actor), hero is often used to refer to any gender, though heroine only refers to women. 　The original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. 　Post-classical and modern heroes, on the other hand, perform great deeds or selfless acts for the common good instead of the classical goal of wealth, pride, and fame. 　The antonym of hero is villain. 　Other terms associated with the concept of hero may include good guy or white hat. 　In classical literature, the hero is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code. 　The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. 　Merriam Webster dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities". 　Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as Gilgamesh, Achilles and Iphigenia, to historical and modern figures, such as Joan of Arc, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Sophie Scholl, Alvin York, Audie Murphy, and Chuck Yeager, and fictional "superheroes", including Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, and Captain America.

<font size=3>
Economics (/ˌɛkəˈnɒmɪks, ˌiːkə-/) is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 　Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. 　Microeconomics analyzes what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. 　Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. 　Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. 　Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing "what is", and normative economics, advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics. 　Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. 　It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing>Fishing</a> 

<font size=3>
Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. 　Fish are often caught as wildlife from the natural environment, but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands and reservoirs. 　Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning. 　The term fishing broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans (shrimp/lobsters/crabs), shellfish, cephalopods (octopus/squid) and echinoderms (starfish/sea urchins). 　The term is not normally applied to harvesting fish raised in controlled cultivations (fish farming). 　Nor is it normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals, where terms like whaling and sealing are used instead. 　Fishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times, and is one of the few food production activities that have persisted from prehistory into modern age, surviving both the Neolithic Revolution and successive Industrial Revolutions. 　In addition to being caught to be eaten for food, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. 　Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept long-term as preserved or living trophies. 　When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released. 　According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. 　Fishing industries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. 　In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms (32 lb), with an additional 7.4 kilograms (16 lb) harvested from fish farms.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste>Taste</a> 

<font size=3>
The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). 　Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. 　Taste, along with olfaction and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. 　Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas, including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. 　The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste. 　The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. 　Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. 　The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. 　There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. 　Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. 　Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells. 　Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami). 　Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.　[citation needed] Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. 　Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. 　Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively. 　The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.　; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and "coolness" (such as of menthol) and "hotness" (pungency), through chemesthesis. 　As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on the body. 　Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons. 　Among humans, taste perception begins to fade at an older age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production. 　Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia). 　Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury>Jury</a> 

<font size=3>
A jury is a sworn body of people (jurors) convened to hear evidence and render an impartial verdict (a finding of fact on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. 　Juries developed in England during the Middle Ages and are a hallmark of the English common law system. 　As such, they are used by the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and other countries whose legal systems were derived from the British Empire. 　But most other countries use variations of the European civil law or Islamic sharia law systems, in which juries are not generally used. 　Most trial juries are "petit juries", and usually consist of twelve people. 　Historically, a larger jury known as a grand jury was used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects. 　All common law countries except the United States and Liberia have phased these out. 　The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. 　Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. 　Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a jury in a trial.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay>Gay</a> 

<font size=3>
Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. 　The term originally meant 'carefree', 'cheerful', or 'bright and showy'. 　While scant usage referring to male homosexuality dates to the late 19th century, that meaning became increasingly common by the mid-20th century. 　In modern English, gay has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the community, practices and cultures associated with homosexuality. 　In the 1960s, gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation. 　By the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex, although it is more commonly used to refer specifically to men. 　At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. 　Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to 'rubbish' or 'stupid') to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to 'weak', 'unmanly', or 'lame'). 　The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.　[needs update]

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost>Ghost</a> 

<font size=3>
A ghost is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that is believed to be able to appear to the living. 　In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely, from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes to realistic, lifelike forms. 　The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a séance. 　Other terms associated with it are apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter, spirit, spook, wraith, demon, and ghoul. 　The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. 　Certain religious practices—funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. 　Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals other than humans have also been recounted. 　They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life. 　According to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Americans say they have seen a ghost. 　The overwhelming consensus of science is that there is no proof that ghosts exist. 　Their existence is impossible to falsify, and ghost hunting has been classified as pseudoscience. 　Despite centuries of investigation, there is no scientific evidence that any location is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. 　Historically, certain toxic and psychoactive plants (such as datura and hyoscyamus niger), whose use has long been associated with necromancy and the underworld, have been shown to contain anticholinergic compounds that are pharmacologically linked to dementia (specifically DLB) as well as histological patterns of neurodegeneration. 　Recent research has indicated that ghost sightings may be related to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. 　Common prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs (such as sleep aids) may also, in rare instances, cause ghost-like hallucinations, particularly zolpidem and diphenhydramine. 　Older reports linked carbon monoxide poisoning to ghost-like hallucinations. 　In folklore studies, ghosts fall within the motif index designation E200–E599 ("Ghosts and other revenants").

<font size=3>
Roger is a masculine given name, and a surname. 　The given name is derived from the Old French personal names Roger and Rogier. 　These names are of Germanic origin, derived from the elements hrōd, χrōþi ("fame", "renown", "honour") and gār, gēr ("spear", "lance") (Hrōþigēraz). 　The name was introduced into England by the Normans. 　In Normandy, the Frankish name had been reinforced by the Old Norse cognate Hróðgeirr. 　The name introduced into England replaced the Old English cognate Hroðgar. 　Roger became a very common given name during the Middle Ages. 　A variant form of the given name Roger that is closer to the name's origin is Rodger.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid>Acid</a> 

<font size=3>
An acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton (i.e. hydrogen ion, H+), known as a Brønsted–Lowry acid, or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair, known as a Lewis acid. 　The first category of acids are the proton donors, or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids. 　Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. 　A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+. 　Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid. 　Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue litmus red, and react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. 　The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus, meaning 'sour'. 　An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as "acid" (as in "dissolved in acid"), while the strict definition refers only to the solute. 　A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution. 　Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic. 　Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride that is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits). 　As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. 　Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid. 　The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. 　An example is boron trifluoride (BF3), whose boron atom has a vacant orbital that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia (NH3). 　Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons (H+) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. 　Hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted–Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair, however, and are therefore not Lewis acids. 　Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted–Lowry acids. 　In modern terminology, an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest>Protest</a> 

<font size=3>
A protest (also called a demonstration, remonstration or remonstrance or a maree richo) is a public expression of objection, disapproval or dissent towards an idea or action, typically a political one. 　Protests can be thought of as acts of cooperation in which numerous people cooperate by attending, and share the potential costs and risks of doing so. 　Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. 　Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves. 　Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as a type of protest called civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. 　Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. 　One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. 　Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing in many countries, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against protesters. 　When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration. 　A protest itself may at times be the subject of a counter-protest. 　In such cases, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest. 　Protesters and counter-protesters can sometimes violently clash. 　One study found that non-violent activism during the civil rights movement in the United States tended to produce favorable media coverage and changes in public opinion focusing on the issues organizers were raising, but violent protests tended to generate unfavorable media coverage that generated public desire to restore law and order.

<font size=3>
A knife (PL: knives; from Old Norse knifr 'knife, dirk') is a tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. 　One of the earliest tools used by humanity, knives appeared at least 2.5 million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools. 　Originally made of wood, bone, and stone (such as flint and obsidian), over the centuries, in step with improvements in both metallurgy and manufacturing, knife blades have been made from copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and titanium. 　Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin. 　Knives can serve various purposes. 　Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocket knife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods (the chef's knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knives (butter knives and steak knives), weapons (daggers or switchblades), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the kirpan).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity>Complexity</a> 

<font size=3>
Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to nonlinearity, randomness, collective dynamics, hierarchy, and emergence. 　The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. 　The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory. 　The intuitive criterion of complexity can be formulated as follows: a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished, and if more connections between them existed. 　Science as of 2010[update] takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed et al. reflect many of these. 　Neil Johnson states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..." 　Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea>Tea</a> 

<font size=3>
Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar. 　Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of Camellia taliensis. 　After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. 　There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. 　Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content. 　An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo. 　It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. 　Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. 　During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India. 　The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis. 　They are the infusions of fruit, leaves, or other plant parts, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. 　These may be called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.

<font size=3>
In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. 　Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. 　The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. 　A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. 　The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. 　The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. 　Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. 　Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. 　Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. 　These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. 　In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio>Antonio</a> 

<font size=3>
Antonio is a masculine given name of Etruscan origin deriving from the root name Antonius. 　It is a common name among Romance language–speaking populations as well as the Balkans and Lusophone Africa. 　It has been among the top 400 most popular male baby names in the United States since the late 19th century and has been among the top 200 since the mid 20th century. 　In the English language it is translated as Anthony, and has some female derivatives: Antonia, Antónia, Antonieta, Antonietta, and Antonella'. 　It also has some male derivatives, such as Anthonio, Antón, Antò, Antonis, Antoñito, Antonino, Antonello, Tonio, Tono, Toño, Toñín, Tonino, Nantonio, Ninni, Totò, Tó, Tonini, Tony, Toni, Toninho, Toñito, and Tõnis. 　The Portuguese equivalent is António (Portuguese orthography) or Antônio (Brazilian Portuguese). 　In old Portuguese the form Antão was also used, not just to differentiate between older and younger but also between more and less important.　[citation needed] In Galician the form is Antón, in Catalan Antò, and in Basque Antxon. 　The Greek versions of the name are Antonios (Αντώνιος) and Antonis (Αντώνης). 　The name derives from Antonius, a well-known Latin family name, probably of Etruscan origin. 　The Roman general Marcus Antonius held that the origin of the name was Anthon (Ανθών), son of Hercules. 　This myth, recorded by Plutarch, was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. 　The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. 　When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. 　Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).

<font size=3>
Mississippi (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi/ (listen)) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered to the north by Tennessee; to the east by Alabama; to the south by the Gulf of Mexico; to the southwest by Louisiana; and to the northwest by Arkansas. 　Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the Mississippi River. 　Mississippi is the 32nd largest and 35th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states and has the lowest per-capita income in the United States. 　Jackson is both the state's capital and largest city. 　Greater Jackson is the state's most populous metropolitan area, with a population of 591,978 in 2020. 　On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union. 　By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top cotton-producing state and slaves accounted for 55% of the state population. 　Mississippi declared its secession from the Union on January 9, 1861, and was one of the seven original Confederate States, which constituted the largest slaveholding states in the nation. 　Following the Civil War, it was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870. 　Until the Great Migration of the 1930s, African Americans were a majority of Mississippi's population. 　In 2020, 37.6% of Mississippi's population was African American, the highest percentage of any state. 　Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the civil rights movement, including the Ole Miss riot of 1962 by white students objecting to desegregation, the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders of three activists working on voting rights. 　Mississippi frequently ranks low among U.S. states in measures of health, education, and development, while ranking high in measures of poverty. 　Top economic industries in Mississippi today are agriculture and forestry. 　Mississippi produces more than half of the country's farm-raised catfish, and is also a top producer of sweet potatoes, cotton and pulpwood. 　Other main industries in Mississippi include advanced manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and health services. 　Mississippi is almost entirely within the Gulf coastal plain, and generally consists of lowland plains and low hills. 　The northwest remainder of the state consists of the Mississippi Delta, a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. 　Mississippi's highest point is Woodall Mountain at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the Cumberland Plateau; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. 　Mississippi has a humid subtropical climate classification.

<font size=3>
A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional, content. 　The word originates from the Latin Documentumcode: lat promoted to code: la , which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceōcode: lat promoted to code: la denotes "to teach". 　In the past, the word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. 　In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. 　Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. 　"Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". 　Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2-dimensional representations. 　While documents can have large varieties of customization, all documents can be shared freely and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. 　History, events, examples, opinions, etc. all can be expressed in documents.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin>Twin</a> 

<font size=3>
Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. 　Twins can be either monozygotic ('identical'), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ('non-identical' or 'fraternal'), meaning that each twin develops from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm cell. 　Since identical twins develop from one zygote, they will share the same sex, while fraternal twins may or may not. 　In rare cases twins can have the same mother and different fathers (heteropaternal superfecundation). 　In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb (the much more common case, in humans) is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is a multiple. 　Unrelated look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgängers.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism>Criticism</a> 

<font size=3>
Criticism is the construction of a judgement about the negative qualities of someone or something. 　Criticism can range from impromptu comments to a written detailed response. 　Criticism falls into several overlapping types including "theoretical, practical, impressionistic, affective, prescriptive, or descriptive". 　Criticism may also refer to an expression of disapproval. 　When criticism of this nature is constructive it can make an individual aware of gaps in their understanding and it can provide distinct routes for improvement. 　Research supports the notion that using feedback and constructive criticism in the learning process is very influential. 　Critique vs criticism In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and 'criticism'. 　The two words both translate as critique, Kritik, and critica, respectively. 　In the English language, philosopher Gianni Vattimo suggests that criticism is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism while critique refers to more general and profound writing as Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. 　Another distinction that is sometimes made is that critique is never personalized nor ad hominem and is presented in a way that encourages rebuttal or expansion of the ideas expressed. 　Nonetheless, the distinctions are subtle and ambiguous at best. 　The term "brickbat" is sometimes used to mean "an unfavourable criticism, unkind remark or sharp put-down". 　The term originated in the 17th century, derived from the practice of throwing bricks as projectiles at a person who was disapproved of. 　In some contexts, such as literary criticism and art criticism, the word criticism is used as a neutral word that is synonymous with evaluation.

Waste (or wastes) are unwanted or unusable materials. 　Waste is any substance discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use. 　A by-product, by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. 　A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero. 　Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others.

<font size=3>
Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. 　It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). 　It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. 　It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative. 　Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. 　The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products. 　Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing>Breathing</a> 

<font size=3>
Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and from the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment, mostly to flush out carbon dioxide and bring in oxygen. 　All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy from the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. 　Breathing, or "external respiration", brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion. 　The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells, where "cellular respiration" takes place. 　The breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli. 　The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, and is one of the four primary vital signs of life. 　Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. 　Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). 　Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. 　Both cause distressing symptoms. 　Breathing has other important functions. 　It provides a mechanism for speech, laughter and similar expressions of the emotions. 　It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. 　Animals that cannot thermoregulate by perspiration, because they lack sufficient sweat glands, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.

Omega (/oʊˈmiːɡə, oʊˈmɛɡə, oʊˈmeɪɡə, əˈmiːɡə/; capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Ancient Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the twenty-fourth and final letter in the Greek alphabet. 　In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. 　The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little"). 　In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [ɔː], comparable to the "aw" of the English word raw in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o] , and the digraph ου which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: [oː]. 　In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel IPA: [o̞] or IPA: [ɔ̝]. 　The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o. 　As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega.

Suffering, or pain in a broad sense, may be an experience of unpleasantness or aversion, possibly associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. 　Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena. 　The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness. 　Suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. 　It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. 　Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. 　Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved. 　Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. 　As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. 　These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

<font size=3>
The reputation of a social entity (a person, a social group, an organization, or a place) is an opinion about that entity typically as a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria, such as behavior or performance. 　Reputation is a ubiquitous, spontaneous, and highly efficient mechanism of social control. 　It is a subject of study in social, management, and technological sciences. 　Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. 　Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. 　At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). 　It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. 　Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control. 　The concept of reputation is considered important in business, politics, education, online communities, and many other fields, and it may be considered as a reflection of that social entity's identity.

<font size=3>
In botany, a plant shoot consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds. 　The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. 　In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. 　In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. 　Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. 　Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. 　As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. 　Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable. 　The shoot of a cucumber Edible shoots of Sachaline Sunflower seedlings germinate A young hass avocado shoot

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 33°N 44°E﻿ / ﻿33°N 44°E﻿ / 33; 44 Iraq, officially the Republic of Iraq, is a country in Western Asia. 　It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest and Syria to the west. 　The capital and largest city is Baghdad. 　Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Iraqi Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, Persians and Shabakis with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. 　The majority of the country's 40 million residents are Muslims – the notable other faiths are Christianity, Yazidism, Mandaeism, Yarsanism and Zoroastrianism. 　The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish; others also recognised in specific regions are Suret (Assyrian), Turkish and Armenian. 　Starting as early as the 6th millennium BC, the fertile alluvial plains between Iraq's Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, referred to as Mesopotamia, gave rise to some of the world's earliest cities, civilisations, and empires ofthe indigenous Mesopotamians in Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria. 　Mesopotamia was a "Cradle of Civilisation" that saw the independent development of a writing system, mathematics, timekeeping, a calendar, astrology, and a law code. 　Following the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital and the largest city of the Abbasid Caliphate, and during the Islamic Golden Age, the city evolved into a significant cultural and intellectual center, and garnered it a worldwide reputation for its academic institutions, including House of Wisdom. 　The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 during the siege of Baghdad, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. 　Modern Iraq dates back to 1920, when the British Mandate for Mesopotamia, joining three Ottoman vilayets, was created under the authority of the League of Nations. 　A British-backed Kingdom was established in 1921 under Faisal I of Iraq. 　The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from the UK in 1932. 　In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created. 　Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. 　In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, sparking a protracted war which would last for almost eight years, and end in a stalemate with devastating losses for both countries. 　After an invasion by the United States and its allies in 2003, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power, and multi-party parliamentary elections were held in 2005. 　The US presence in Iraq ended in 2011. 　Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic. 　The president is the head of state, the prime minister is the head of government, and the constitution provides for two deliberative bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. 　The judiciary is free and independent of the executive and the legislature. 　Iraq is considered an emerging middle power with a strategic location and a founding member of the United Nations, the OPEC as well as of the Arab League, OIC, Non-Aligned Movement and the IMF. 　From 1920 to 2005 Iraq experienced spells of significant economic and military growth and briefer instability including wars. 　Since the inception of the current multipartite system in 2005, the country has seen further growth and steadier international investment, and a major decline in factional domestic attacks.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer>Beer</a> 

<font size=3>
Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed type of alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after potable water and tea. 　It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. 　During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. 　Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. 　Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. 　In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation. 　Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. 　Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. 　The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. 　The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above. 　Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling, pub quizzes and pub games. 　When beer is distilled, the resulting liquor is a form of whisky.

<font size=3>
Geometry (from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría) 'land measurement'; from γῆ (gê) 'earth, land', and μέτρον (métron) 'a measure')[citation needed] is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. 　It is concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. 　A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. 　Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts. 　During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. 　One of the oldest such discoveries is Carl Friedrich Gauss' Theorema Egregiumcode: lat promoted to code: la ("remarkable theorem") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. 　This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry. 　Later in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. 　The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry. 　Since then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.　—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others. 　Originally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. 　Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. 　For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.

Debate is a process that involves formal discourse on a particular topic, often including a moderator and audience. 　In a debate, arguments are put forward for often opposing viewpoints. 　Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate halls, coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies. 　Debate has also been conducted for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies. 　These debates put an emphasis upon logical consistency, factual accuracy, and emotional appeal to an audience.　[citation needed] Modern forms of competitive debate also include rules for participants to discuss and decide upon the framework of the debate (how the debate will be judged).　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either "ranked higher than", "ranked lower than" or "ranked equal to" the second. 　In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. 　It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. 　The rankings themselves are totally ordered. 　For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. 　If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie. 　By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. 　Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see. 　Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics.

<font size=3>
Stress, either physiological, biological or psychological, is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. 　Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. 　There are two hormones that an individual produces during a stressful situation, these are well known as adrenaline and cortisol. 　There are two kinds of stress hormone levels. 　Resting (basal) cortisol levels are normal everyday quantities that are essential for standard functioning. 　Reactive cortisol levels are increases in cortisol in response to stressors. 　Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. 　In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. 　The sympathoadrenal medullary (SAM) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis. 　The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. 　The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. 　Through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism and susceptibility to diseases. 　Disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve>Curve</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight. 　Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. 　This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: "The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width." 　This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. 　In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. 　In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. 　This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). 　Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations. 　Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. 　This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. 　For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve. 　A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. 　More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. 　If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. 　In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. 　When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. 　Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. 　In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid>Fluid</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, a fluid is a liquid, gas, or other material that continuously deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. 　They have zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, are substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them. 　Although the term fluid generally includes both the liquid and gas phases, its definition varies among branches of science. 　Definitions of solid vary as well, and depending on field, some substances can be both fluid and solid. 　Viscoelastic fluids like Silly Putty appear to behave similar to a solid when a sudden force is applied. 　Substances with a very high viscosity such as pitch appear to behave like a solid (see pitch drop experiment) as well. 　In particle physics, the concept is extended to include fluidic matters other than liquids or gases. 　A fluid in medicine or biology refers any liquid constituent of the body (body fluid), whereas "liquid" is not used in this sense. 　Sometimes liquids given for fluid replacement, either by drinking or by injection, are also called fluids (e.g. "drink plenty of fluids"). 　In hydraulics, fluid is a term which refers to liquids with certain properties, and is broader than (hydraulic) oils.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing>Clothing</a> 

<font size=3>
Clothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on the body. 　Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. 　The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. 　The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations. 　Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head. 　Eyewear and jewelry are not generally considered items of clothing, but play an important role in fashion and clothing as costume. 　Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. 　Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. 　It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. 　Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. 　It may be used to prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats. 　Clothing is used for protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare. 　Fashioned with pockets, belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands. 　Clothing has significant social factors as well. 　Wearing clothes is a variable social norm. 　It may connote modesty. 　Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing. 　In many parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breasts, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure. 　Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs. 　Clothing also may be used to communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism. 　Some forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor's white coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect). 　More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified protective accessories. 　At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form fitting body covers, and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to amount to more of a tool than a garment. 　This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption and flexible electronic substrates. 　Clothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants, other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market — where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise). 　A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble.

<font size=3>
In psychology, a rush is an acute transcendent state of euphoria. 　A wide variety of recreational drugs are commonly capable of such an event. 　These drugs include, but are not limited to, opioids (particularly heroin) and psychostimulants (particularly methamphetamine and cocaine). 　A 2017 study involving fifty six female clients were interviewed by Nicholas E. Goeders suggests that the subjective rush from recreational methamphetamine use is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases. 　Goeders concluded that "Without a doubt methamphetamine, when injected in “sufficient” purity and dose, can produce a subjective physiological response in women that is indistinguishable from an orgasm." 　Intravenous injection is the fastest route of administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide>Suicide</a> 

<font size=3>
Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. 　Mental disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders), physical disorders (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), and substance abuse (including alcoholism and the use of and withdrawal from benzodiazepines) are risk factors. 　Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress (such as from financial or academic difficulties), relationship problems (such as breakups or divorces), or harassment and bullying. 　Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts. 　Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance abuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions. 　Although crisis hotlines are common resources, their effectiveness has not been well studied. 　The most commonly adopted method of suicide varies from country to country and is partly related to the availability of effective means. 　Common methods of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. 　Suicides resulted in 828,000 deaths globally in 2015, an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990.[inconsistent] This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. 　Approximately 1.5% of all deaths worldwide are by suicide. 　In a given year, this is roughly 12 per 100,000 people. 　Rates of suicide are generally higher among men than women, ranging from 1.5 times higher in the developing world to 3.5 times higher in the developed world. 　Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries, those aged between 15 and 30 are at the highest risk. 　Europe had the highest rates of suicide by region in 2015. 　There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. 　Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. 　In the Western world, attempts are more common among young people and women. 　Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. 　The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide as an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. 　During the samurai era in Japan, a form of suicide known as seppuku (腹切り, harakiri) was respected as a means of making up for failure or as a form of protest. 　Sati, a practice outlawed by the British in India, expected a Hindu widow to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from her family and society. 　Suicide and attempted suicide, while previously illegal, are no longer so in most Western countries. 　It remains a criminal offense in some countries. 　In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide has been used on rare occasions as a form of protest, and kamikaze and suicide bombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic. 　Suicide is often seen as a major catastrophe for families, relatives, and other nearby supporters, and it is viewed negatively almost everywhere around the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics>Comics</a> 

<font size=3>
Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual information. 　It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. 　Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. 　There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. 　Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form that uses photographic images. 　Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. 　Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and tankōbon have become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century. 　The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. 　Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. 　By the mid-20th century, comics flourished, particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially France and Belgium), and Japan. 　The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. 　American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. 　Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. 　Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era (1945–) with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. 　Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and academics. 　The English term comics is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium itself (e.g. "Comics is a visual art form."), but becomes plural when referring to works collectively (e.g. "Comics are popular reading material.").

The inch (symbol: in or ″) is a unit of length in the British imperial and the United States customary systems of measurement. 　It is equal to 1/36 yard or 1/12 of a foot. 　Derived from the Roman uncia ("twelfth"), the word inch is also sometimes used to translate similar units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. 　Standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s the inch has been based on the metric system and defined as exactly 25.4 mm.

<font size=3>
In the Westminster system of government, the Estimates are an outline of government spending for the following fiscal year presented by the cabinet to parliament. 　The Estimates are drawn up by bureaucrats in the finance ministry in collaboration with cabinet ministers. 　They consist of detailed reports on how each department or ministry will spend its money. 　The estimates are normally introduced in the responsible chamber (the lower house in bicameral parliaments) just prior to the main Budget Day, which gives them time to be analyzed by House committees. 　Unlike the budget, the estimates contain no references to fiscal policy, long-term goals, or funding. 　After each section is reviewed by the relevant committee the entire Estimates are voted on as one bill. 　Defeat on the vote is treated as loss of supply and tantamount to loss of confidence. 　Unlike tax proposals in the budget, the Estimates are rarely controversial, with most issues being dealt with in committee. 　Most of the countries also mandate an update or series of updates to the Estimates to account for changes in the economy or in government policy. 　In Canada, for instance, this update must be passed in December each year.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar>Sugar</a> 

<font size=3>
Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. 　Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. 　Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). 　White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. 　In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars. 　Longer chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars, and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. 　Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. 　Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar. 　Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants. 　Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. 　Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. 　In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. 　Maltose may be produced by malting grain. 　Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. 　It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. 　A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose. 　Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available processed food and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). 　The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year, with North and South Americans consuming up to 50 kg (110 lb) and Africans consuming under 20 kg (44 lb). 　As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. 　Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tooth decay. 　Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. 　In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake.

<font size=3>
Houston (/ˈhjuːstən/ (listen); HEW-stən) is the most populous city in Texas and in the Southern United States. 　It is the fourth most populous city in the United States after Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City; the sixth most populous city in North America. 　With a population of 2,304,580 in 2020, Houston is located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it is the seat and largest city of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area, which is the fifth-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second-most populous in Texas after Dallas–Fort Worth. 　Houston is the southeast anchor of the greater megaregion known as the Texas Triangle. 　Comprising a land area of 640.4 square miles (1,659 km2), Houston is the ninth-most expansive city in the United States (including consolidated city-counties). 　It is the largest city in the United States by total area whose government is not consolidated with a county, parish, or borough. 　Though primarily in Harris County, small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend, and Montgomery counties, bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands. 　The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. 　The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas's independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. 　After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century. 　The arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas's primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. 　In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified, as it became home to the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, home to the Mission Control Center. 　Since the late 19th century Houston's economy has had a broad industrial base, in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. 　Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the second-most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits (after New York City). 　The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled. 　Nicknamed the "Bayou City", "Space City", "H-Town", and "the 713", Houston has become a global city, with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. 　The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. 　Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major city in the U.S. 　It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than seven million visitors a year to the Museum District. 　The Museum District is home to nineteen museums, galleries, and community spaces. 　Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District, and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.

Ownership is the state or fact of legal possession and control over property, which may be any asset, tangible or intangible. 　Ownership can involve multiple rights, collectively referred to as title, which may be separated and held by different parties. 　The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain, transfer, and lose ownership of property in a number of ways. 　To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, win it in a bet, receive it as a gift, inherit it, find it, receive it as damages, earn it by doing work or performing services, make it, or homestead it. 　One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other property, giving it as a gift, misplacing it, or having it stripped from one's ownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking. 　Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property.

<font size=3>
In geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock across which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movements. 　Large faults within Earth's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates, such as the megathrust faults of subduction zones or transform faults. 　Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes. 　Faults may also displace slowly, by aseismic creep. 　A fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault. 　A fault trace or fault line is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface. 　A fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to represent a fault. 　A fault zone is a cluster of parallel faults. 　However, the term is also used for the zone of crushed rock along a single fault. 　Prolonged motion along closely spaced faults can blur the distinction, as the rock between the faults is converted to fault-bound lenses of rock and then progressively crushed.

Infrastructure is the set of facilities and systems that serve a country, city, or other area, and encompasses the services and facilities necessary for its economy, households and firms to function. 　Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical structures such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access). 　In general, infrastructure has been defined as "the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions" and maintain the surrounding environment. 　Especially in light of the massive societal transformations needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change, contemporary infrastructure conversations frequently focus on sustainable development and green infrastructure. 　Acknowledging this importance, the international community has created policy focused on sustainable infrastructure through the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Sustainable Development Goal 9 "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure". 　One way to describe different types of infrastructure is to classify them as two distinct kinds: hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. 　Hard infrastructure is the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry. 　This includes roads, bridges, and railways. 　Soft infrastructure is all the institutions that maintain the economic, health, social, environmental, and cultural standards of a country. 　This includes educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.

Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals (hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, e.g. kaolin, Al2Si2O5(OH)4). 　Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. 　Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour from small amounts of iron oxide. 　Clay is the oldest known ceramic material. 　Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay and used it for making pottery. 　Some of the earliest pottery shards have been dated to around 14,000 BC, and clay tablets were the first known writing medium. 　Clay is used in many modern industrial processes, such as paper making, cement production, and chemical filtering. 　Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. 　Clay is a very common substance. 　Shale, formed largely from clay, is the most common sedimentary rock. 　Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. 　Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. 　Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. 　Soils high in swelling clays (expansive clay), which are clay minerals that readily expand in volume when they absorb water, are a major challenge in civil engineering.

<font size=3>
Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly O. glaberrima (African rice). 　The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza. 　As a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population, particularly in Asia and Africa. 　It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize. 　Since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important food crop with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. 　There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally. 　The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. 　This simple method requires sound irrigation planning, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. 　While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. 　Rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. 　Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. 　However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. 　Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. 　Production and consumption of rice is estimated to have been responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.

<font size=3>
In political science, an initiative (also known as a popular initiative or citizens' initiative) is a means by which a petition signed by a certain number of registered voters can force a government to choose either to enact a law or hold a public vote in the legislature in what is called indirect initiative, or under direct initiative, where the proposition is put to a plebiscite or referendum, in what is called a Popular initiated Referendum or citizen-initiated referendum. 　In an indirect initiative, a measure is first referred to the legislature, and then put to a popular vote only if not enacted by the legislature. 　If the proposed law is rejected by the legislature, the government may be forced to put the proposition to a referendum. 　The initiative may then take the form of a direct initiative or an indirect initiative. 　In a direct initiative, a measure is put directly to a referendum. 　The vote may be on a proposed federal level, statute, constitutional amendment, charter amendment or local ordinance, or obligate the executive or legislature to consider the subject by submitting it to the order of the day. 　It is a form of direct democracy.

<font size=3>
The mail or post is a system for physically transporting postcards, letters, and parcels. 　A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. 　Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as a government monopoly, with a fee on the article prepaid. 　Proof of payment is usually in the form of an adhesive postage stamp, but a postage meter is also used for bulk mailing. 　Postal authorities often have functions aside from transporting letters. 　In some countries, a postal, telegraph and telephone (PTT) service oversees the postal system, in addition to telephone and telegraph systems. 　Some countries' postal systems allow for savings accounts and handle applications for passports. 　The Universal Postal Union (UPU), established in 1874, includes 192 member countries and sets the rules for international mail exchanges as a Specialized Agency of the United Nations.
