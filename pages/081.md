Marcus Valerius Martialis (known in English as Martial /ˈmɑːrʃəl/; March, between 38 and 41 AD – between 102 and 104 AD) was a Roman poet born in Hispania (modern Spain) best known for his twelve books of Epigrams, published in Rome between AD 86 and 103, during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. 　In these short, witty poems he cheerfully satirises city life and the scandalous activities of his acquaintances, and romanticises his provincial upbringing. 　He wrote a total of 1,561 epigrams, of which 1,235 are in elegiac couplets. 　Martial has been called the greatest Latin epigrammatist, and is considered the creator of the modern epigram.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture>Furniture</a> 
<font size=3>
Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, eating and/or working with an item, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). 　Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). 　Furniture can be a product of design and can be considered a form of decorative art. 　In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. 　It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. 　Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflects the local culture. 　People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites. 　Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. 　Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne. 　The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. 　Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt. 　This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. 　The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. 　The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented. 　Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. 　The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. 　The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles. 　The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. 　One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.

<font size=3>
Mo (貘) was the standard Chinese name for the giant panda from the 3rd century BCE to the 19th century CE, but in 1824, the French sinologist Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat mistakenly identified the mo as the recently discovered black-and-white Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), which never inhabited China in historical times. 　He based this misidentification on Chinese woodblock illustrations that depicted a mythological mo (貘) chimera with elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail and tiger paws (also known as the Japanese baku 獏), which the famous Tang poet Bai/Bo Juyi first described in the 9th century. 　The consequences of Abel-Rémusat's error were extensive. 　His presumption that mo meant "Chinese tapir" was immediately adopted in Western zoology, and by the end of the 19th century, it was accepted as modern scientific fact in China and Japan. 　In the 20th century, since mo had lost its original meaning, the giant panda was given a new Chinese name da xiongmao (大熊貓 lit. "large bear cat").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving>Saving</a> 
<font size=3>
Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. 　Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash. 　Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs. 　In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. 　Saving does not automatically include interest. 　Saving differs from savings. 　The former refers to the act of not consuming one's assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one's assets in the form of cash. 　Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. 　This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to "saving" as "savings". 　In different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. 　For example, the part of a person's income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. 　However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as "saving" unless the institutions and people who receive them save them. 　Saving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter. 　By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. 　Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth. 　However, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. 　If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. 　This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. 　In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. 　In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. 　Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. 　However, savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to an (interest-free) loan to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan. 　In a primitive agricultural economy, savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. 　If the whole crop were consumed the economy would convert to hunting and gathering the next season.

<font size=3>
The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 　It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 　An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. 　It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. 　Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own. 　The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. 　It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. 　Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. 　What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra. 　The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 　As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most populations living in small isolated pockets. 　India currently hosts the largest tiger population. 　Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. 　Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density. 　The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. 　It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. 　The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

<font size=3>
The mess (also called a mess deck aboard ships) is a designated area where military personnel socialize, eat and (in some cases) live. 　The term is also used to indicate the groups of military personnel who belong to separate messes, such as the officers' mess, the chief petty officer mess, and the enlisted mess. 　In some civilian societies this military usage has been extended to the eating arrangements of other disciplined services such as fire fighting and police forces. 　The root of mess is the Old French mes, "portion of food" (cf. modern French mets), drawn from the Latin verb mittere, meaning "to send" and "to put" (cf. modern French mettre), the original sense being "a course of a meal put on the table"; cfr. 　also the modern Italian portata with the same meaning, past participle of portare, to bring. 　This sense of mess, which appeared in English in the 13th century, was often used for cooked or liquid dishes in particular, as in the "mess of pottage" (porridge or soup) or Eton mess.

A sphere (from Ancient Greek σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'globe, ball') is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle. 　A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space. 　That given point is the centre of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius. 　The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians. 　The sphere is a fundamental object in many fields of mathematics. 　Spheres and nearly-spherical shapes also appear in nature and industry. 　Bubbles such as soap bubbles take a spherical shape in equilibrium. 　The Earth is often approximated as a sphere in geography, and the celestial sphere is an important concept in astronomy. 　Manufactured items including pressure vessels and most curved mirrors and lenses are based on spheres. 　Spheres roll smoothly in any direction, so most balls used in sports and toys are spherical, as are ball bearings.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity>Christianity</a> 
<font size=3>
Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. 　It is the world's largest and most widespread religion with roughly 2.4 billion followers representing one-third of the global population. 　Its adherents, known as Christians, are estimated to make up a majority of the population in 157 countries and territories, and believe that Jesus is the Son of God, whose coming as the Messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and chronicled in the New Testament. 　Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century Hellenistic Judaism in the Roman province of Judea. 　Jesus' apostles and their followers spread around the Levant, Europe, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, the South Caucasus, Ancient Carthage, Egypt, and Ethiopia, despite significant initial persecution. 　It soon attracted gentile God-fearers, which led to a departure from Jewish customs, and, after the Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism, Christianity slowly separated from Judaism. 　Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. 　The creeds of various Christian denominations generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news". 　Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, with the Old Testament as the gospel's respected background. 　Emperor Constantine the Great decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire (380). 　The early history of Christianity's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the "Great Church" (though divergent sects existed at the same time, including Gnostics, Marcionites, and Jewish Christians). 　The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus (431) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon (451) over differences in Christology, while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East–West Schism (1054), mostly over the authority of the bishop of Rome. 　Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century) over theological and ecclesiological disputes, most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome. 　Christianity played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly in Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages. 　Following the Age of Discovery (15th–17th century), Christianity was spread into the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world via missionary work and European colonialism especially during the period of new imperialism. 　The four largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion), Protestantism (800 million), the Eastern Orthodox Church (220 million), and the Oriental Orthodox churches (60 million), though thousands of smaller church communities exist despite efforts toward unity (ecumenism). 　Despite a decline in adherence in the West, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the region, with about 70% of that population identifying as Christian. 　Christianity is growing in Africa and Asia, the world's most populous continents. 　Christians remain greatly persecuted in many regions of the world, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement>Requirement</a> 
<font size=3>
In product development and process optimization, a requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy. 　It is commonly used in a formal sense in engineering design, including for example in systems engineering, software engineering, or enterprise engineering. 　It is a broad concept that could speak to any necessary (or sometimes desired) function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, internal user, or other stakeholder. 　Requirements can come with different levels of specificity; for example, a requirement specification or requirement "spec" (often imprecisely referred to as "the" spec/specs, but there are actually different sorts of specifications) refers to an explicit, highly objective/clear (and often quantitative) requirement (or sometimes, set of requirements) to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. 　A set of requirements is used as inputs into the design stages of product development. 　Requirements are also an important input into the verification process, since tests should trace back to specific requirements. 　Requirements show what elements and functions are necessary for the particular project. 　When iterative methods of software development or agile methods are used, the system requirements are incrementally developed in parallel with design and implementation. 　With the waterfall model requirements are developed before design and implementation.

<font size=3>
Bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair. 　Biases can be innate or learned. 　People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. 　In science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error. 　Statistical bias results from an unfair sampling of a population, or from an estimation process that does not give accurate results on average.

<font size=3>
Autumn, also known as fall in American English and Canadian English, is one of the four temperate seasons on Earth. 　Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). 　Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. 　Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). 　One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.

<font size=3>
In biology, a strain is a genetic variant, a subtype or a culture within a biological species. 　Strains are often seen as inherently artificial concepts, characterized by a specific intent for genetic isolation. 　This is most easily observed in microbiology where strains are derived from a single cell colony and are typically quarantined by the physical constraints of a Petri dish. 　Strains are also commonly referred to within virology, botany, and with rodents used in experimental studies.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
Bernard (Bernhard) is a French and West Germanic masculine given name. 　It is also a surname. 　The name is attested from at least the 9th century. 　West Germanic Bernhard is composed from the two elements bern "bear" and hard "brave, hardy". 　Its native Old English reflex was Beornheard, which was replaced by the French form Bernard that was brought to England after the Norman Conquest. 　The name Bernhard was notably popular among Old Frisian speakers. 　Its wider use was popularized due to Saint Bernhard of Clairvaux (canonized in 1174). 　Bernard is the second most common surname in France.

<font size=3>
Customs is an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal effects, and hazardous items, into and out of a country. 　Traditionally, customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties (i.e. tariffs) and other taxes on import and export. 　In recent decades, the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues: taxation, security, and trade facilitation. 　Each country has its own laws and regulations for the import and export of goods into and out of a country, enforced by their respective customs authorities; the import/export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden entirely. 　A wide range of penalties are faced by those who break these laws.
