Coordinates: 50°50′N 4°00′E﻿ / ﻿50.833°N 4.000°E﻿ / 50.833; 4.000 Belgium, officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a country in Northwestern Europe. 　The country is bordered by the Netherlands to the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast, France to the southwest, and the North Sea to the northwest. 　It covers an area of 30,528 km2 (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5 million, making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe, with a density of 376/km2 (970/sq mi). 　Belgium is part of an area known as the Low Countries, historically a somewhat larger region than the Benelux group of states, as it also included parts of northern France. 　The capital and largest city is Brussels; other major cities are Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi, Liège, Bruges, Namur, and Leuven. 　Belgium is a sovereign state and a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. 　Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. 　It is divided into three highly autonomous regions: the Flemish Region (Flanders) in the north, the Walloon Region (Wallonia) in the south, and the Brussels-Capital Region. 　Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita. 　Belgium is also home to two main linguistic communities: the Flemish Community, which constitutes about 60 percent of the population, and the French Community, which constitutes about 40 percent of the population. 　A small German-speaking Community, numbering around one percent, exists in the East Cantons. 　The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, although French is the dominant language. 　Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its complex system of governance, made up of six different governments. 　Since the Middle Ages, Belgium's central location near several major rivers has meant that the area has been relatively prosperous, connected commercially and politically to its bigger neighbours. 　The country as it exists today was established following the 1830 Belgian Revolution, when it seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which had incorporated the Southern Netherlands (which comprised most of modern-day Belgium) after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. 　The name chosen for the new state is derived from the Latin word Belgium, used in Julius Caesar's "Gallic Wars", to describe a nearby region in the period around 55 BCE. 　Belgium has also been the battleground of European powers, earning the moniker the "Battlefield of Europe", a reputation reinforced in the 20th century by both world wars. 　Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution, and during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in Africa. 　Between 1885 and 1908, the Congo Free State, which was privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium, was characterized by widespread atrocities and disease, leading to a population decline of millions; amid public outcry in Europe, Belgium annexed the territory as a colony. 　The Belgian colonial empire gained independence between 1960 and 1962. 　The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fuelled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia. 　This continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching state reforms, resulting in the transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement between 1970 and 1993. 　Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly among the Flemish; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the June 2010 federal election, a world record. 　Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the Second World War. 　Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the European Union, and its capital, Brussels, is also the de facto capital of the European Union itself, hosting the official seats of the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Council, as well as one of two seats of the European Parliament (the other being Strasbourg). 　Belgium is also a founding member of the Eurozone, NATO, OECD, and WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the Schengen Area. 　Brussels also hosts the headquarters of many major international organizations, such as NATO. 　Belgium is a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy. 　It has very high standards of living, quality of life, health care, education, and is categorized as "very high" on the Human Development Index. 　It also ranks relatively high on the Global Peace Index.

Detroit (/dəˈtrɔɪt/ də-TROYT, locally also /ˈdiːtrɔɪt/ DEE-troyt; French: Détroit, lit. 'strait') is the largest city in the U.S. state of Michigan. 　It is also the largest U.S. city on the United States–Canada border, and the seat of government of Wayne County. 　The City of Detroit had a population of 639,111 at the 2020 census, making it the 27th-most populous city in the United States. 　The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million people, making it the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area, and the 14th-largest in the United States. 　Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to music, art, architecture and design, in addition to its historical automotive background. 　Time named Detroit as one of the fifty World's Greatest Places of 2022 to explore. 　Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 　The City of Detroit anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest, behind Chicago and Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and the 16th-largest in the United States. 　Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the "Big Three" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler) are all headquartered in Metro Detroit. 　As of 2007[update], the Detroit metropolitan area is the number one exporting region among 310 defined metropolitan areas in the United States. 　The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hub airports in the United States. 　Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected through a highway tunnel, railway tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge, which is the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana. 　Both cities will soon be connected by a new bridge currently under construction, the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will provide a complete freeway-to-freeway link. 　The new bridge is expected to be open by 2024. 　In 1701, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, the future city of Detroit. 　During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. 　The city's population became the fourth-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia, with the expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century. 　As Detroit's industrialization took off, the Detroit River became the busiest commercial hub in the world. 　The strait carried over 65 million tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world each year; the freight throughput was more than three times that of New York and about four times that of London. 　By the 1940s, the city's population remained the fourth-largest in the country. 　However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization, among other reasons, Detroit entered a state of urban decay and lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. 　Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 65 percent. 　In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances. 　Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. 　The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. 　Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. 　More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other neighborhoods have increased.　[citation needed] An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 16 million visitors per year. 　In 2015, Detroit was named a "City of Design" by UNESCO, the first U.S. city to receive that designation.

<font size=3>
Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. 　Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for meat since prehistoric times. 　The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. 　This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses. 　Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. 　It is edible raw but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. 　Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with, and decomposition by, bacteria and fungi. 　Meat is important to the food industry, economies, and cultures around the world. 　There are nonetheless people who choose to not eat meat (vegetarians) or any animal products (vegans), for reasons such as taste preferences, ethics, environmental concerns, health concerns or religious dietary rules.

Nanna, Sīn /ˈsiːn/ or Suen (Akkadian: 𒂗𒍪 EN.ZU, pronounced Su'en, Sen, Sîn), and in Aramaic syn, syn’, or even shr 'moon', or Nannar (Sumerian: 𒀭𒋀𒆠 DŠEŠ.KI, DNANNAR) was the god of the moon in the Mesopotamian religions of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia and Aram. 　He was also associated with cattle, perhaps due to the perceived similarity between bull horns and the crescent moon. 　He was always described as a major deity, though only a few sources, mostly these from the reign of Nabonidus, consider him to be the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon. 　The two chief seats of his worship were Ur in the south of Mesopotamia and Harran in the north, though he was also worshiped in numerous other cities, especially in the proximity of Ur and in the Diyala area. 　In Ur, he was connected to royal power, and many Mesopotamian kings visited his temple in this city. 　According to Mesopotamian mythology, his parents were Enlil and Ninlil, while his wife was Ningal, worshiped with him in his major cult centers. 　Their children included major deities Innanna (Ishtar) and Utu (Shamash) and minor gods such as Ningublaga and Numushda. 　Some deities, for example Nanaya and Pinikir, were sometimes regarded as his children due to syncretism between them and his daughter Ishtar. 　Nanna acquired a number of syncretic associations himself, and the logographic writings of his name were used to represent these of other moon gods, such as Ugaritic Yarikh or Hurrian Kusuh.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral>Integral</a> 
<font size=3>
In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. 　Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operation of calculus, the other being differentiation. 　Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. 　Today integration is used in a wide variety of scientific fields. 　The integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. 　Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. 　Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. 　In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. 　The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known. 　Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. 　Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs. 　In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more robust than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable. 　Integrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. 　For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. 　In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon>Demon</a> 
<font size=3>
A demon is a malevolent supernatural entity. 　Historically, belief in demons, or stories about demons, occurs in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology, and folklore; as well as in media such as comics, video games, movies, anime, and television series. 　Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from humanity's fear of the unknown, the strange and the horrific. 　In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including early Judaism and ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. 　Large portions of Jewish demonology, a key influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism, and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era. 　Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils: minions of the Devil. 　In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc.). 　In religions featuring a principal Devil (e.g. Satan) locked in an eternal struggle with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil. 　As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions. 　The original Ancient Greek word daimōn (δαίμων) did not carry negative connotations, as it denotes a spirit or divine power. 　The Greek conception of a daimōn notably appears in the philosophical works of Plato, where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates. 　In Christianity, morally ambivalent daimōn were replaced by demons, forces of evil only striving for corruption. 　Such demons are not the Greek intermediary spirits, but hostile entities, already known in Iranian beliefs. 　In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology, a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled. 　Belief in demons remains an important part of many modern religions and occultist traditions. 　Demons are still feared largely due to their alleged power to possess living creatures. 　In the contemporary Western occultist tradition (perhaps epitomized by the work of Aleister Crowley), a demon (such as Choronzon, which is Crowley's interpretation of the so-called "Demon of the Abyss") is a useful metaphor for certain inner psychological processes (inner demons), though some may also regard it as an objectively real phenomenon.

<font size=3>
In music, an arrangement is a musical adaptation of an existing composition. 　Differences from the original composition may include reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or formal development. 　Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. 　Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings. Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety". 　In jazz, a memorized (unwritten) arrangement of a new or pre-existing composition is known as a head arrangement.

<font size=3>
A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). 　A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church, or temple, and may also serve as an oratory, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. 　A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, balneary and infirmary, and outlying granges. 　Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. 　These may include a hospice, a school, and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge, or a brewery. 　In English usage, the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. 　In modern usage, convent tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters. 　Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a friary. 　Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.

<font size=3>
Resource refers to all the materials available in our environment which are technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally sustainable and help us to satisfy our needs and wants. 　Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability — they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources. 　They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of the level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localised (private, community-owned, national and international resources). 　An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology. 　The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being. 　From a human perspective, a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. 　From a broader biological or ecological perspective, a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). 　The concept of resources has been developed across many established areas of work, in economics, biology and ecology, computer science, management, and human resources for example - linked to the concepts of competition, sustainability, conservation, and stewardship. 　In application within human society, commercial or non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource management. 　The concept of a resource can also be tied to the direction of leadership over resources, this can include the things leaders have responsibility for over the human resources, with management, help, support or direction such as in charge of a professional group, technical experts, innovative leaders, archiving expertise, academic management, association management, business management, healthcare management, military management, public administration, spiritual leadership and social networking administrator.

<font size=3>
vi (pronounced as distinct letters, /ˌviːˈaɪ/) is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. 　The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX. 　The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley. 　Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978. 　It was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second BSD in May 1979 that the editor was installed under the name "vi" (which took users straight into ex's visual mode), and the name by which it is known today. 　Some current implementations of vi can trace their source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new, largely compatible reimplementations.　[citation needed][discuss] The name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command visual, which switches the ex line editor to its full-screen mode. 　The name is pronounced /ˌviːˈaɪ/ (the English letters v and i). 　In addition to various non–free software variants of vi distributed with proprietary implementations of Unix, vi was opensourced with OpenSolaris, and several free and open source software vi clones exist. 　A 2009 survey of Linux Journal readers found that vi was the most widely used text editor among respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor, by nearly a factor of two (36% to 19%).
