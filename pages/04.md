Texas (/ˈtɛksəs/, also locally /ˈtɛksɪz/; Spanish: Texas, Tejas) is a state in the South Central region of the United States. 　At 268,596 square miles (695,662 km2), and with more than 30 million residents in 2022, it is the second-largest U.S. state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). 　Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest; and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. 　Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the U.S., while San Antonio is the second most populous in the state and seventh-largest in the U.S. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are, respectively, the fourth- and fifth-largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country. 　Other major cities include Austin, the second most populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso. 　Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. 　The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal. 　The origin of Texas's name is from the Caddo word táyshaʼ meaning 'friends'. 　Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and the Southwestern regions. 　Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than ten percent of Texas's land area is desert. 　Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. 　Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend. 　The term "six flags over Texas" refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory. 　Spain was the first European country to claim and control the area of Texas. 　France held a short-lived colony. 　Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming the Republic of Texas. 　In 1845, Texas joined the union as the 28th state. 　The state's annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican–American War in 1846. 　A slave state before the American Civil War, Texas declared its secession from the U.S. in early 1861, and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March 2 of the same year. 　After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation. 　Historically, four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. 　Before and after the U.S. Civil War, the cattle industry—which Texas came to dominate—was a major economic driver for the state, and created the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. 　In the later 19th century, cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. 　It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. 　Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry during the mid-20th century. 　As of 2022, it has the most Fortune 500 company headquarters (53) in the United States. 　With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. 　Texas has led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002, and has the second-highest gross state product. 　If Texas were a sovereign state, it would have the 10th-largest economy in the world.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell>Hell</a> 

<font size=3>
In religion and folklore, hell is a location or state in the afterlife in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering, most often through torture, as eternal punishment after death. 　Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are Christianity and Islam, whereas religions with reincarnation usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations, as is the case in the dharmic religions. 　Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under Earth's surface. 　Other afterlife destinations include heaven, paradise, purgatory, limbo, and the underworld. 　Other religions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe an abode of the dead, the grave, a neutral place that is located under the surface of Earth (for example, see Kur, Hades, and Sheol). 　Such places are sometimes equated with the English word hell, though a more correct translation would be "underworld" or "world of the dead". 　The ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Finnic religions include entrances to the underworld from the land of the living.

<font size=3>
In production, research, retail, and accounting, a cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something or deliver a service, and hence is not available for use anymore. 　In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. 　In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. 　This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. 　Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production. 　More generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision. 　Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes. 　Costs (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability.

<font size=3>
A prince is a male ruler (ranked below a king, grand prince, and grand duke) or a male member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. 　Prince is also a title of nobility (often highest), often hereditary, in some European states. 　The female equivalent is a princess. 　The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun prīnceps, from primus (first) and caput (head), meaning "the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble ruler, prince".

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husband>Husband</a> 

<font size=3>
A husband is a male in a marital relationship, who may also be referred to as a spouse. 　The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies and cultures, and have varied over time. 　In monogamous cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage, which is enforced by laws against bigamy and polygamy. 　Traditionally, the husband was regarded as the head of the household and was expected to be the sole provider or breadwinner, a role that continues in some cultures (sometimes described as paternalistic). 　Today, a husband is not necessarily considered the breadwinner of the family, especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career. 　In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children. 　The term continues to be applied to such a man who has separated from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized divorce or the death of his spouse. 　On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a widower; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the "ex-husband" of his former spouse.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport>Airport</a> 

<font size=3>
An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. 　Airports usually consist of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. 　Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. 　In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation. 　Operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. 　Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. 　Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. 　Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. 　Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass>Glass</a> 

<font size=3>
Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent, amorphous solid that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. 　Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring. 　The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. 　Soda–lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. 　The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. 　Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material. 　Despite being brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glassmaking cultures. 　Archaeological evidence suggests glassmaking dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. 　The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience. 　Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. 　In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles. 　Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass. 　The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials. 　Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass).

<font size=3>
Eyes are organs of the visual system. 　They provide living organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision. 　Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons (neurones). 　In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain. 　Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. 　Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods. 　The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angle of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. 　From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.

<font size=3>
An hour (symbol: h; also abbreviated hr) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as 1⁄24 of a day and scientifically reckoned between 3,599 and 3,601 seconds, depending on the speed of Earth's rotation. 　There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. 　The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of 1⁄12 of the night or daytime. 　Such seasonal, temporal, or unequal hours varied by season and latitude. 　Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as 1⁄24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it 1⁄24 of the mean solar day. 　Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second. 　In the modern metric system, hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds. 　However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second, making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is based on measurements of the mean solar day.

Comes (/ˈkoʊmiːz/ KOH-meez), plural comites (/ˈkɒmɪtiːz/ KOM-i-teez), was a Roman title or office, and the origin Latin form of the medieval and modern title "count". 　Before becoming a word for various types of title or office, the word originally meant "companion", either individually or as a member of a collective denominated a "comitatus", especially the suite of a magnate, being in some instances sufficiently large and/or formal to justify specific denomination, e.g. a "cohors amicorum". 　"Comes" derives from "com-" ("with") and "ire" ("go").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train>Train</a> 

<font size=3>
A train (from Old French trahiner, from Latin trahere, "to pull, to draw") is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight. 　Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units. 　Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. 　Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. 　Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport. 　Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables. 　Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. 　Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities. 　Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power. 　Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. 　The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well. 　Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport. 　High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances. 　Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century. 　Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks. 　While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation. 　Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes. 　Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains. 　Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal>Metal</a> 

<font size=3>
A metal (from Greek μέταλλον métallon, "mine, quarry, metal") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. 　Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets). 　These properties are the result of the metallic bond between the atoms or molecules of the metal. 　A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride. 　In physics, a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero. 　Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures. 　For example, the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. 　Equally, some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals. 　Sodium, for example, becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure. 　In chemistry, two elements that would otherwise qualify (in physics) as brittle metals—arsenic and antimony—are commonly instead recognised as metalloids due to their chemistry (predominantly non-metallic for arsenic, and balanced between metallicity and nonmetallicity for antimony). 　Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (or are likely to be such). 　The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. 　In astrophysics the term "metal" is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium, and not just traditional metals. 　In this sense the first four "metals" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, all of which are strictly non-metals in chemistry. 　A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. 　Used in that sense, the metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements. 　Metals, as chemical elements, comprise 25% of the Earth's crust and are present in many aspects of modern life. 　The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. 　Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. 　The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. 　Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. 　Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code>Code</a> 

<font size=3>
In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. 　An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. 　But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. 　The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. 　The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. 　Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. 　One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. 　For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. 　Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice>Ice</a> 

<font size=3>
Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 °F (0 °C; 273 K) Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. 　In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects. 　Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice. 　It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate. 　It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets. 　Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure. 　When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature. 　When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena. 　Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as "ice one h") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds. 　The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure. 　It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost. 　The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation. 　Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting.

<font size=3>
Look up majority in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. 　A majority, also called a simple majority or absolute majority to distinguish it from related terms, is more than half of the total. 　It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements. 　For example, if a group consists of 20 individuals, a majority would be 11 or more individuals, while having 10 or fewer individuals would not constitute a majority. 　"Majority" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a "majority vote", which means more than half of the votes cast. 　A majority can be compared to a plurality (sometimes called relative majority), which is a subset larger than any other subset but not necessarily larger than all other subsets combined, and not necessarily greater than half of the set. 　For example, if there is a group with 20 members which is divided into subgroups with 9, 6, and 5 members, then the 9-member group would be the plurality. 　A plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements. 　This can occur when there are three or more possible choices. 　The (absolute) majority is sometimes referred to as a "simple" majority, compared to a supermajority (a majority requirement above 50%, like a 2/3 requirement), however use of this term is inconsistent as it sometimes refers to a mere plurality (as opposed to an absolute majority). 　In British English the term "majority" is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e., the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher. 　Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.

"Appears" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. 　It was released by Avex Trax on November 10, 1999 as the sixth single from her second studio album Loveppears (1999), which was released on the same day. 　Alongside this, it has been released in several other territories with different release dates under her Western alias Ayu. 　It also served as Hamasaki's first limited edition single, limiting physical sales to 300,000 copies. 　The track was written by Hamasaki herself, while production was handled by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura. 　Musically, "Appears" is a dance song written in third person perspective, and is about the third person watching what appears to be a happy and loving relationship. 　Upon its release, "Appears" received positive reviews from music critics. 　Alexey Eremenko, writing for AllMusic, selected the track as the best song from the album and her career. 　However, an editor from CD Journal criticized the amount of remixes on the CD single. 　Commercially, the single was a success in Japan, peaking at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and TBS' Count Down TV chart. 　It sold just below its restricted 300,000 units, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 200,000 units. 　An accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, which displays Hamasaki walking around New York City and observing people. 　To promote the single, it appeared on several remix and greatest hits compilation albums conducted by Hamasaki, and has been included on some of her concert tours, including part two of her 2000 concert tour and the 2007 Secret Tour.

A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles and techniques to communicate ideas. 　Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. 　Writers' texts are published across a wide range of media. 　Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. 　The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone "writer" typically refers to the creation of written language. 　Some writers work from an oral tradition. 　Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. 　Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. 　Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. 　Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing. 　In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words. 　As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about how they write (their writing process); why they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism). 　Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. 　Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.　[citation needed] The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. 　Author most often refers to the writer of a book.

<font size=3>
A navy, naval force, or maritime force is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. 　It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields. 　The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). 　The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. 　The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 　Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density>Density</a> 

<font size=3>
Density (volumetric mass density or specific mass) is the substance's mass per unit of volume. 　The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. 　Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: ρ = m V {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}} where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. 　In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. 　For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. 　Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. 　Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. 　To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity "relative density" or "specific gravity", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. 　Thus a relative density less than one relative to water means that the substance floats in water. 　The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. 　This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. 　Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. 　Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. 　In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid, which causes it to rise relative to denser unheated material. 　The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. 　Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass. 　Other conceptually comparable quantities or ratios include specific density, relative density (specific gravity), and specific weight.

<font size=3>
Silver is a chemical element with the symbol Ag (from the Latin argentum, derived from the Proto-Indo-European h₂erǵ: "shiny" or "white") and atomic number 47. 　A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. 　The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. 　Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. 　Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. 　Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. 　Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". 　As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures. 　Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term "silverware"), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized confectionery. 　Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film. 　Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.

Chicago (/ʃɪˈkɑːɡoʊ/ (listen) shih-KAH-goh, locally also /ʃɪˈkɔːɡoʊ/ shih-KAW-goh; Miami-Illinois: Shikaakwa; Ojibwe: Zhigaagong) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois and the third most populous in the United States after New York City and Los Angeles. 　With a population of 2,746,388 in the 2020 census, it is also the most populous city in the Midwest. 　As the seat of Cook County (the second-most populous U.S. county), the city is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area, one of the largest in the world. 　On the shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed. 　It grew rapidly in the mid-19th century; by 1860, Chicago was the youngest U.S. city to exceed a population of 100,000. 　The Great Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, but Chicago's population continued to grow to 503,000 by 1880 and then doubled to more than a million within the decade. 　The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after the fire, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world. 　Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new construction styles (such as Chicago School architecture, the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper). 　Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. 　It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of Trade, which today is part of the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone. 　O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked among the world's top six busiest airports according to tracked data by the Airports Council International. 　The region also has the largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad hub. 　The Chicago area has one of the highest gross domestic products (GDP) in the world, generating $689 billion in 2018. 　The economy of Chicago is diverse, with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce. 　It is home to several Fortune 500 companies, including Archer-Daniels-Midland, Conagra Brands, Exelon, JLL, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Mondelez International, Motorola Solutions, Sears, and United Airlines Holdings. 　Chicago's 58 million tourist visitors in 2018 set a new record. 　Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, Willis (Sears) Tower, Grant Park, Museum of Science and Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. 　Chicago is also home to the Barack Obama Presidential Center being built in Hyde Park on the city's South Side. 　Chicago's culture includes the visual arts, literature, film, theater, comedy (especially improvisational comedy), food, dance (including modern dance and jazz troupes and the Joffrey Ballet), and music (particularly jazz, blues, soul, hip-hop, gospel, and electronic dance music, including house music). 　Chicago is also the location of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. 　Of the area's colleges and universities, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois Chicago are classified as "highest research" doctoral universities. 　Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues, including two Major League Baseball teams.

<font size=3>
Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. 　In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. 　"Psychological peace" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined, yet often a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioural peace." 　Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition." 　Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life. 　The acquisition of such a "peaceful internal disposition" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests. 　Peace is not a state of excitement although we are happy when excited, but peace is when one's mind is quiet and satisfied.

Youth is the time of life when one is young. 　The word, youth, can also mean the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity), but it can also refer to one's peak, in terms of health or the period of life known as being a young adult. 　Youth is also defined as "the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one, who is young". 　Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work, or having sexual relations. 　Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. 　Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave>Wave</a> 

<font size=3>
In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities. 　Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some frequency. 　When the entire waveform moves in one direction, it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave. 　In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero. 　Waves are often described by a wave equation (standing wave field of two opposite waves) or a one-way wave equation for single wave propagation in a defined direction. 　Two types of waves are most commonly studied in classical physics. 　In a mechanical wave, stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. 　A mechanical wave is a local deformation (strain) in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too. 　For example, sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium. 　Other examples of mechanical waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations, and vortices. 　In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations. 　Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent). 　Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays. 　Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity; heat diffusion waves; plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction–diffusion waves, such as in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more. 　Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer energy, momentum, and information, but they do not transfer particles in the medium. 　In mathematics and electronics waves are studied as signals. 　On the other hand, some waves have envelopes which do not move at all such as standing waves (which are fundamental to music) and hydraulic jumps. 　Some, like the probability waves of quantum mechanics, may be completely static[dubious – discuss]. 　A physical wave field is almost always confined to some finite region of space, called its domain. 　For example, the seismic waves generated by earthquakes are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet, so they can be ignored outside it. 　However, waves with infinite domain, that extend over the whole space, are commonly studied in mathematics, and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains. 　A plane wave is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any (infinite) plane normal to a specific direction of travel. 　Mathematically, the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency. 　In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and/or different frequencies. 　A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or longitudinal wave if those vectors are aligned with the propagation direction. 　Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids (such as air) can only be longitudinal. 　That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave's polarization, which can be an important attribute.

<font size=3>
A municipality is usually a single administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate. 　The term municipality may also mean the governing body of a given municipality. 　A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. 　The term is derived from French municipalitécode: fra promoted to code: fr and Latin municipaliscode: lat promoted to code: la . 　The English word municipality derives from the Latin social contract municipiumcode: lat promoted to code: la (derived from a word meaning "duty holders"), referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy). 　A municipality can be any political jurisdiction, from a sovereign state such as the Principality of Monaco, to a small village such as West Hampton Dunes, New York. 　The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass only one populated place such as a city, town, or village several such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the U.S. state of New Jersey (1798–1899) as townships governing several villages, municipalities of Mexico, municipalities of Colombia) only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city, such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught>Caught</a> 

<font size=3>
Caught is a method of dismissing a batsman in cricket. 　A batsman is out caught if the batsman hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery, with the bat, and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground. 　If the ball hits the stumps after hitting the wicket-keeper, If the wicket-keeper fails to do this, the delivery is a "no ball", and the batsman cannot be stumped (nor run out, unless he attempts to run to the other wicket.) If the catch taken by the wicket-keeper,then informally it is known as caught behind or caught at the wicket. 　A catch by the bowler is known as caught and bowled. 　This has nothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the catcher and bowler are the same player. 　(The scorecard annotation is usually 　c. and 　b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name.　) Caught is the most common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition, accounting for 36,190 Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012, which is 56.9% of all Test match dismissals in this period. 　South African wicket-keeper Mark Boucher holds the record for the most Test match catches, with 532, while Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most Test match catches by non-wicket-keepers, with 210.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire>Empire</a> 

<font size=3>
An empire is a political unit made up of several territories and peoples, "usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries". 　The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) exercises political control over the peripheries. 　Within an empire, different populations have different sets of rights and are governed differently. 　Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state is an emperor; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples). 　There have been "ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign" Empires. 　An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, which include territories that are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the Carthaginian Empire and British Empire. 　Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). 　The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. 　Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance>Dance</a> 

<font size=3>
Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. 　Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. 　An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. 　Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics. 　Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. 　Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing competitions found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards. 　Dance requires an equal amount of cognitive focus as well as physical strength. 　The demanding yet evolving art-form allows individuals to express themselves creatively through movement, while enabling them to adapt movement that possesses a rhythmical pattern and fluid motions that allure to an audience either onstage or on film. 　Dance is considered to be a very aesthetically pleasing art-form.

<font size=3>
Pay is an expression used in hydrocarbon mining. 　It denotes a portion of a reservoir that contains economically recoverable hydrocarbons. 　The term derives from the possibility of "paying" an income surpassing the costs. 　Equivalent terms are pay sand or pay zone. 　Overall interval in which pay volumes occur is the gross pay; smaller portions of the reservoir that meet further criteria for pay (such as permeability and hydrocarbon saturation) are net pay. 　Net pay is determined through placing cut offs on properties like permeability, porosity, water saturation or volume of shale. 　Care needs to be taken to cut out the part of the gross rock volume that has the ability to allow fluids to flow and actually stores hydrocarbons. 　In other cases when determining "Net Reservoir" the remaining rock is that rock that can still store flow hydrocarbons but is not necessary containing hydrocarbons. 　When the cut off is based on the ability of the rock to store hydrocarbons this is called "Net Rock".

<font size=3>
A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the exchange of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. 　Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window. 　Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. 　Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts. 　In addition to this, many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh, often made of aluminum or fibreglass, to keep bugs out when the window is opened. 　Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, Rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows. 　The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria c. 　100 AD. 　Presentations of windows can be seen in ancient Egyptian wall art and sculptures from Assyria. 　Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan. 　In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century. 　In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups. 　Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.

"window" in German), is a geologic structure formed by erosion or normal faulting on a thrust system. 　In such a system the rock mass (hanging wall block) that has been transported by movement along the thrust is called a nappe. 　When erosion or normal faulting produces a hole in the nappe where the underlying autochthonous (i.e. un-transported) rocks crop out this is called a window. 　Klippen are also a feature near windows. 　The klippe is the remnant portion of a nappe after erosion has removed connecting portions of the nappe. 　This process results in an outlier of exotic, often nearly horizontally translated strata overlying autochthonous strata. 　Windows can be almost any size, from a couple of metres to hundreds of kilometres. 　Well known examples of tectonic windows are Hohe Tauern window in Eastern Alps or Hrzdavá dolina tectonic window in Western Carpathians. 　Look up autochthonous in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple>Temple</a> 

<font size=3>
A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice. 　Religions which erect temples include Christianity (whose temples are typically called churches), Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism (whose temples are called gurudwara), Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), Islam (whose temples are called mosques), Judaism (whose temples are called synagogues), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called Agiary), the Baha'i Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baha'i House of Worship), Taoism (which are sometimes called Daoguan), Shinto (which are sometimes called Jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion. 　The form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be, in some sense, the "house" of one or more deities. 　Typically, offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. 　The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts, or even the whole main building. 　can only be accessed by the clergy. 　Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like an igloo. 　The word comes from Ancient Rome, where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. 　It has the same root as the word "template," a plan in preparation for the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur.

<font size=3>
A medal or medallion is a small portable artistic object, a thin disc, normally of metal, carrying a design, usually on both sides. 　They typically have a commemorative purpose of some kind, and many are presented as awards. 　They may be intended to be worn, suspended from clothing or jewellery in some way, although this has not always been the case. 　They may be struck like a coin by dies or die-cast in a mould. 　A medal may be awarded to a person or organisation as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, cultural, academic, or various other achievements. 　Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. 　Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. 　In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. 　An artist who creates medals or medallions is called a "medalist". 　Medals have long been popular collectible items, and in numismatics form a class called either exonumia or militaria. 　In the proper use of the term, medallions are larger, starting at perhaps four inches across, and are, as such, usually too large to be worn very comfortably, though in colloquial use, "medallion" is often used to refer to a medal used as the pendant of a necklace (as in the medallion man fashion style of the 1960s and 1970s), or for other types of medals. 　Medallions may also be called "table medals" because they are too large to be worn and can only be displayed on a wall, table top, desk, or cabinet.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle>Castle</a> 

<font size=3>
A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. 　Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. 　This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. 　Use of the term has varied over time and has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. 　Over the approximately 900 years when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace. 　European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. 　These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies. 　Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. 　Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source. 　Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. 　Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. 　In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. 　This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. 　Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower. 　These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. 　Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. 　Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape. 　Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. 　While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. 　As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. 　From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.

<font size=3>
The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life forms. 　Every cell consists of a cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, and contains many biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites. 　The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'. 　Cells can acquire specified function and carry out various tasks within the cell such as replication, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and motility. 　Cells are capable of specialization and mobility within the cell. 　Most cells are measured in micrometers due to their small size. 　Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres. 　Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure. 　Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). 　Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms. 　The number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species; it has been approximated that the human body contains an estimated 37 trillion (3.72×1013) cells. 　The brain accounts for around 80 billion of these cells. 　The study of cells and how they work has led to many other studies in related areas of biology, including: discovery of DNA, cancer systems biology, aging and developmental biology. 　Cell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. 　Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. 　Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.

<font size=3>
Genus (/ˈdʒiːnəs/ plural genera /ˈdʒɛnərə/) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. 　In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. 　In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. 　E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. 　Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae. 　The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. 　The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. 　There are some general practices used, however, including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful: monophyly – all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together (i.e. phylogenetic analysis should clearly demonstrate both monophyly and validity as a separate lineage). 　reasonable compactness – a genus should not be expanded needlessly. 　distinctness – with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria, i.e. ecology, morphology, or biogeography; DNA sequences are a consequence rather than a condition of diverging evolutionary lineages except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g. postzygotic barriers). 　Moreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera.

<font size=3>
An attempt to commit a crime occurs if a criminal has an intent to commit a crime and takes a substantial step toward completing the crime, but for reasons not intended by the criminal, the final resulting crime does not occur. 　Attempt to commit a particular crime is a crime, usually considered to be of the same or lesser gravity as the particular crime attempted.　: 669–671  Attempt is a type of inchoate crime, a crime that is not fully developed. 　The crime of attempt has two elements, intent and some conduct toward completion of the crime. 　One group of theories in criminal law is that attempt to commit an act occurs when a person comes dangerously close to carrying out a criminal act, and intends to commit the act, but does not commit it. 　The person may have carried out all the necessary steps (or thought they had) but still failed, or the attempt may have been abandoned or prevented at a late stage. 　The attempt must have gone beyond mere planning or preparation, and is distinct from other inchoate offenses such as conspiracy to commit a crime or solicitation of a crime. 　There are many specific crimes of attempt, such as attempted murder, which may vary by jurisdiction. 　Punishment is often less severe than would be the case if the attempted crime had been carried out. 　Abandonment of the attempt may constitute a not guilty defence, depending partly on the extent to which the attempt was abandoned freely and voluntarily. 　Early common law did not punish attempts; the law of attempt was not recognised by common law until the case of b. 　Rex v. Scofield in 1784.: 669  The essence of the crime of attempt in legal terms is that the defendant has failed to commit the actus reus (the Latin term for the "guilty act") of the full offense, but has the direct and specific intent to commit that full offense. 　The normal rule for establishing criminal liability is to prove an actus reus accompanied by a mens rea ("guilty mind") at the relevant time (see concurrence and strict liability offenses as the exception to the rule).

<font size=3>
Zealand (Danish: Sjælland [ˈɕeˌlænˀ]) at 7,031 km2 is the largest and most populous island in Denmark proper (thus excluding Greenland and Disko Island, which are larger in size). 　Zealand had a population of 2,319,705 on 1 January 2020. 　It is the 13th-largest island in Europe by area and the 4th most populous. 　It is connected to Sprogø and Funen by the Great Belt Fixed Link and to Amager by several bridges in Copenhagen. 　Indirectly, through the island of Amager and the Øresund Bridge, it is also linked to Scania in Sweden. 　In the south, the Storstrøm Bridge and the Farø Bridges connect it to Falster, and beyond that island to Lolland, from where the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel to Germany is planned. 　Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, with a population between 1.3 and 1.4 million people in 2020, is located mostly on the eastern shore of Zealand and partly on the island of Amager. 　Other cities on Zealand include Roskilde, Hillerød, Næstved, Helsingør, Slagelse, Køge, Holbæk and Kalundborg. 　Administratively, Zealand is divided between two Danish regions: The Copenhagen metropolitan area and North Zealand belong to the Capital Region, while the major and more rural part of the island belongs to the Zealand Region.

Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. 　In everyday language, truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences. 　Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsehood. 　The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. 　Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. 　Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. 　Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. 　This is called the correspondence theory of truth. 　Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. 　There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates, such as: the question of defining truth. 　If it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth. 　Identifying things are truth-bearers and are therefore capable of being true or false. 　If truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if there are other truth values. 　Identifying the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood. 　The role that truth plays in constituting knowledge. 　And if truth is always absolute, or if it can be relative to one's perspective.

<font size=3>
A fellow is a concept whose exact meaning depends on context. 　In learned or professional societies, it refers to a privileged member who is specially elected in recognition of their work and achievements. 　Within the context of higher educational institutions, a fellow can be a member of a highly ranked group of teachers at a particular college or university or a member of the governing body in some universities (such as the Fellows of Harvard College); it can also be a specially selected postgraduate student who has been appointed to a post (called a fellowship) granting a stipend, research facilities and other privileges for a fixed period (usually one year or more) in order to undertake some advanced study or research, often in return for teaching services. 　In the context of research and development-intensive large companies or corporations, the title "fellow" is sometimes given to a small number of senior scientists and engineers. 　In the context of medical education in North America, a fellow is a physician who is undergoing a supervised, sub-specialty medical training (fellowship) after having completed a specialty training program (residency).

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain>Pain</a> 

<font size=3>
Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. 　The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage." 　In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. 　Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. 　Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. 　Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. 　Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. 　It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. 　Simple pain medications are useful in 20% to 70% of cases. 　Psychological factors such as social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, excitement, or distraction can affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. 　In some debates regarding physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, pain has been used as an argument to permit people who are terminally ill to end their lives.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine>Machine</a> 

<font size=3>
A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action. 　The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines. 　Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. 　They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. 　Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage. 　Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. 　Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory>Victory</a> 

<font size=3>
The term victory (from Latin victoria) originally applied to warfare, and denotes success achieved in personal combat, after military operations in general or, by extension, in any competition. 　Success in a military campaign constitutes a strategic victory, while the success in a military engagement is a tactical victory. 　In terms of human emotion, victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in human behaviour often exhibits movements and poses paralleling threat display preceding the combat, which are associated with the excess endorphin built up preceding and during combat. 　Victory dances and victory cries similarly parallel war dances and war cries performed before the outbreak of physical violence.　[citation needed] Examples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term victoria originated, include: the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus); and also the "abominable song" to Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579.[citation needed] The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn. 　The Roman Republic and Empire celebrated victories with triumph ceremonies and with monuments such as victory columns (e.g. Trajan's Column) and arches. 　A trophy is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (spolia), or body parts (as in the case of head hunters). 　Mythology often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek Nike or the Roman Victoria. 　The victorious agent is a hero, often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a monster (as Saint George slaying the dragon, Indra slaying Ahi, Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent etc.). 　Sol Invictus ("the Invincible Sun") of Roman mythology became an epithet of Christ in Christianity. 　Paul of Tarsus presents the resurrection of Christ as a victory over Death and Sin (1 Corinthians 15:55). 　The Latinate English-language word victory (from the 14th century) replaced the Old English equivalent term sige (cognate with Gothic sigis, Old High German sigu and Sieg in modern German), a frequent element in Germanic names (as in Sigibert, Sigurd etc.), cognate to Celtic sego and Sanskrit sahas.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry. 　In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed. 　Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role. 　Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoir, letters, and essays. 　Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other printed information on a particular subject. 　Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura/litteraturacode: lat promoted to code: la "learning, a writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from litera/litteracode: lat promoted to code: la "letter". 　In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts. 　Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature. 　Literature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are often further categorized according to historical period, adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 23°N 102°W﻿ / ﻿23°N 102°W﻿ / 23; -102 Mexico (Spanish: México), officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. 　It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. 　Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi), making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with approximately 126,014,024 inhabitants, it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. 　Mexico is organized as a federal republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital. 　Other major urban areas include Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León. 　Human presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico goes back to 8,000 BCE and it went to become one of the world's six cradles of civilization. 　In particular, the Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. 　Last were the Aztecs, who dominated the region in the century before European contact. 　In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of New Spain. 　Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church played an important role expanding the territory, enforcing Christianity and spreading the Spanish language throughout. 　With the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain soon became one of the most important mining centers worldwide. 　Wealth coming from Asia and the New World contributed to Spain's status as a major world power for the next centuries, and brought about a price revolution in Western Europe. 　The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the War of Independence against Spain. 　Mexico's early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs. 　The Federal Republic of Central America shortly seceded the country. 　Then two invasions by foreign powers took place: first, by the United States as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers, which led to the Mexican–American War and huge territorial losses in 1848. 　After the introduction of liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with the war of Reform and prompted France to invade the country and install an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal President Benito Juárez, which emerged victorious. 　The last decades of the 19th century were dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order. 　However, the Porfiriato era led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican Revolution (civil war). 　This conflict led to profound changes in Mexican society, including the proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. 　The remaining war generals ruled as a succession of presidents until the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) emerged in 1929. 　The PRI governed Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic developmental policies of considerable economic success. 　During World War II Mexico also played an important role for the Allied war effort. 　Nonetheless, the PRI regime resorted to repression and electoral fraud to maintain power, and moved the country to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic policy during the late 20th century. 　This culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which caused a major indigenous rebellion in the state of Chiapas. 　PRI lost the presidency for the first time in 2000, against the conservative party (PAN). 　Mexico has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest economic partner. 　As a newly industrialized and developing country ranking 86th, high in the Human Development Index, its large economy and population, cultural influence, and steady democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power which is also identified as an emerging power by several analysts. 　Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 　It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity. 　Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals. 　However, the country continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and extensive crime. 　It ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index, due in large part to ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates, which violently compete for the US drug market and trade routes. 　This "drug war" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006. 　Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine>Engine</a> 

<font size=3>
An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy. 　Available energy sources include potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth's gravitational field as exploited in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g. geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and nuclear energy (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). 　Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form, so heat engines have special importance. 　Some natural processes, such as atmospheric convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the form of rising air currents). 　Mechanical energy is of particular importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing. 　Mechanical heat engines convert heat into work via various thermodynamic processes. 　The internal combustion engine is perhaps the most common example of a mechanical heat engine, in which heat from the combustion of a fuel causes rapid pressurisation of the gaseous combustion products in the combustion chamber, causing them to expand and drive a piston, which turns a crankshaft. 　Unlike internal combustion engines, a reaction engine (such as a jet engine) produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, in accordance with Newton's third law of motion. 　Apart from heat engines, electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air, and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. 　In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and ultimately motion (a chemical engine, but not a heat engine). 　Chemical heat engines which employ air (ambient atmospheric gas) as a part of the fuel reaction are regarded as airbreathing engines. 　Chemical heat engines designed to operate outside of Earth's atmosphere (e.g. rockets, deeply submerged submarines) need to carry an additional fuel component called the oxidizer (although there exist super-oxidizers suitable for use in rockets, such as fluorine, a more powerful oxidant than oxygen itself); or the application needs to obtain heat by non-chemical means, such as by means of nuclear reactions.

<font size=3>
The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. 　The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. 　The shoulder joint, also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. 　In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, and the head sits in the glenoid cavity. 　The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint. 　The shoulder joint is the main joint of the shoulder. 　It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. 　The joint capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. 　It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. 　The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint and contribute to the shoulder's stability. 　The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. 　The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head. 　The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing, and pulling.

Memory is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. 　It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. 　If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. 　Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia. 　Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory. 　This can be related to the neuron. 　The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. 　Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. 　Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. 　The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material. 　Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store through various categorical models or systems. 　Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data. 　Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory. 　Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane. 　Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory. 　Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information. 　An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming phenomenon. 　Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning. 　Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors. 　The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted. 　Pain, for example, has been identified as a physical condition that impairs memory, and has been noted in animal models as well as chronic pain patients. 　The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage. 　Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus. 　Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory. 　Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory.

<font size=3>
Coordinates: 43°N 12°E﻿ / ﻿43°N 12°E﻿ / 43; 12 Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic or the Republic of Italy, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. 　Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it consists of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands; its territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region. 　Italy shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. 　It has a territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione. 　Italy covers an area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi), with a population of about 60 million. 　It is the third-most populous member state of the European Union, the sixth-most populous country in Europe, and the tenth-largest country in the continent by land area. 　Italy's capital and largest city is Rome. 　Italy was the native place of many civilizations such as the Italic peoples and the Etruscans, while due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the country has also historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures, who immigrated to the peninsula throughout history. 　The Latins, native of central Italy, formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. 　The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering a large part of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. 　By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed. 　During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Barbarian Invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous city-states and maritime republics, mostly in the North, became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. 　The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art. 　During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. 　However, centuries of rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states, and the invasions of other European powers during the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically fragmented. 　Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries with the decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean. 　By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and military events, led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. 　After centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy. 　From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. 　Despite being one of the victorious allied powers in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of the Italian fascist dictatorship in 1922. 　The participation of Italy in World War II on the Axis led to the Italian surrender to Allied powers and its occupation by Nazi Germany helped by Fascists, followed by the rise of the Italian Resistance and the subsequent Italian Civil War and liberation of Italy. 　After the war, the country abolished its monarchy, established a democratic unitary parliamentary republic, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, getting a major advanced economy. 　Italy is a highly developed country, having the tenth-largest nominal GDP (third in the European Union) in the world, the ninth-largest national wealth and the third-largest central bank gold reserve. 　It ranks highly in life expectancy, quality of life, healthcare, education, and Human Development Index. 　The country is a great power, and it has a significant role in regional and global economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. 　Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the G7, the Latin Union, the Schengen Area, and many more. 　The source of many inventions and discoveries, the country is considered a cultural superpower and has long been a global centre of art, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, tourism and fashion, as well as having greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields including cinema, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking, and business. 　It has the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (58), and is the world's fifth-most visited country.

<font size=3>
Russia (Russian: Россия, Rossiya, [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian Federation, is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. 　It is the largest country in the world, with its internationally recognised territory covering 17,098,246 square kilometres (6,601,670 sq mi), and encompassing one-eighth of Earth's inhabitable landmass. 　Russia extends across eleven time zones and shares land boundaries with fourteen countries. 　It is the world's ninth-most populous country and Europe's most populous country, with a population of over 147 million people. 　The country's capital and largest city is Moscow. 　Saint Petersburg is Russia's cultural centre and second-largest city. 　Other major urban areas include Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. 　The East Slavs emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. 　The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. 　Rus' ultimately disintegrated, with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. 　By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history. 　However, with the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and replaced by the Russian SFSR—the world's first constitutionally socialist state. 　Following the Russian Civil War, the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union (with three other Soviet republics), within which it was the largest and principal constituent. 　At the expense of millions of lives, the Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialization in the 1930s, and later played a decisive role for the Allies of World War II by leading large-scale efforts on the Eastern Front. 　With the onset of the Cold War, it competed with the United States for global ideological influence; the Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space. 　In 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the independent Russian Federation. 　A new constitution was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a federal semi-presidential republic. 　Since the turn of the century, Russia's political system has been dominated by Vladimir Putin, under whom the country has experienced democratic backsliding and a shift towards authoritarianism. 　Russia has been involved militarily in a number of post-Soviet conflicts, which has included the internationally unrecognised annexations of Crimea in 2014 from neighbouring Ukraine and four other regions in 2022 during an ongoing invasion. 　International rankings of Russia place it low in measurements of human rights and freedom of the press; the country also has high levels of perceived corruption. 　Ranked worldwide, the Russian economy stands at the ninth-largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by GDP (PPP). 　Its mineral and energy sources are the world's largest, and its figures for oil production and natural gas production rank high globally. 　Russia possesses the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and has the fifth-highest military expenditure. 　The country is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council; a member state of the G20, the SCO, BRICS, the APEC, the OSCE, and the WTO; and is the leading member state of the CIS, the CSTO, and the EAEU. 　Russia is home to 30 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball>Basketball</a> 

<font size=3>
Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. 　A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. 　After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. 　The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. 　Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. 　On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. 　It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. 　The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. 　The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). 　Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. 　Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. 　The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. 　Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. 　The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. 　Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup. 　The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. 　The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage>Marriage</a> 

<font size=3>
Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a culturally and often legally recognized union between people called spouses. 　It establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. 　It is nearly a cultural universal, but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time. 　Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. 　In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. 　A marriage ceremony is called a wedding. 　Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious purposes. 　Whom they marry may be influenced by gender, socially determined rules of incest, prescriptive marriage rules, parental choice, and individual desire. 　In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, child marriage, polygamy, and forced marriage are practiced. 　In other areas, such practices are outlawed to preserve women's rights or children's rights (both female and male) or as a result of international law. 　In some parts of the world, marriage has historically restricted the rights of women, who are (or were) considered the property of the husband. 　Around the world, primarily in developed democracies, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights for women within marriage (including abolishing coverture, liberalizing divorce laws, and reforming reproductive and sexual rights) and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith, interracial/interethnic/inter-caste, and same-sex couples. 　Controversies continue regarding the legal status of married women, leniency towards violence within marriage, customs such as dowry and bride price, forced marriage, marriageable age, and criminalization of premarital and extramarital sex. 　Female age at marriage has proven to be a strong indicator for female autonomy and is continuously used by economic history research. 　Marriage can be recognized by a state, an organization, a religious authority, a tribal group, a local community, or peers. 　It is often viewed as a contract. 　A religious marriage is performed by a religious institution to recognize and create the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony in that religion. 　Religious marriage is known variously as sacramental marriage in Catholicism, nikah in Islam, nissuin in Judaism, and various other names in other faith traditions, each with their own constraints as to what constitutes, and who can enter into, a valid religious marriage.

<font size=3>
Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.　: 445  Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure. 　Various units are used to express pressure. 　Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre (N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi, symbol lbf/in2) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and U.S. customary systems. 　Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as 1⁄760 of this. 　Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.

<font size=3>
A branch, sometimes called a ramus in botany, is a woody structural member connected to the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub). 　Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs. 　The term twig usually refers to a terminus, while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk. 　Due to a broad range of species of trees, branches and twigs can be found in many different shapes and sizes. 　While branches can be nearly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches. 　A number of mathematical properties are associated with tree branchings; they are natural examples of fractal patterns in nature, and, as observed by Leonardo da Vinci, their cross-sectional areas closely follow the da Vinci branching rule.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel>Hotel</a> 

<font size=3>
A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. 　Facilities provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator, and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat-screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. 　Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. 　Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, a business center with computers, printers, and other office equipment, childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. 　Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. 　Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. 　Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. 　In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. 　The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. 　For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. 　Inns began to cater to wealthier clients in the mid-18th century. 　One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in 1768. 　Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century, paricularly in the United States. 　Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. 　Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. 　An upscale full-service hotel facility offers luxury amenities, full-service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service, and clothes-ironing staff. 　Full-service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site full-service restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities. 　Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. 　Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities. 　Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. 　Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full-service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. 　Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. 　A motel is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car parking area. 　Boutique hotels are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. 　A number of hotels and motels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture. 　Some hotels are built specifically as destinations in themselves, for example casinos and holiday resorts. 　Most hotel establishments are run by a general manager who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the "hotel manager"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), middle managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. 　The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex>Sex</a> 

<font size=3>
Sex is the trait that determines whether a sexually reproducing animal or plant produces male or female gametes. 　Male plants and animals produce small mobile gametes (spermatozoa, sperm, pollen), while females produce larger, non-motile ones (ova, often called egg cells). 　Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites. 　During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes fuse to form zygotes, which develop into offspring that inherit traits from each parent. 　Males and females of a species may have physical similarities (sexual monomorphism) or differences (sexual dimorphism) that reflect various reproductive pressures on the respective sexes. 　Mate choice and sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes. 　The terms male and female typically do not apply in sexually undifferentiated species in which the individuals are isomorphic (look the same) and the gametes are isogamous (indistinguishable in size and shape), such as the green alga Ulva lactuca. 　Some kinds of functional differences between gametes, such as in fungi, may be referred to as mating types. 　The sex of a living organism is determined by its genes. 　Most mammals have the XY sex-determination system, where male mammals usually carry an X and a Y chromosome (XY), whereas female mammals usually carry two X chromosomes (XX). 　Other chromosomal sex-determination systems in animals include the ZW system in birds, and the X0 system in insects. 　Various environmental systems include temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles and crustaceans.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port>Port</a> 

<font size=3>
A port is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers. 　Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals. 　Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their histories. 　Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port. 　For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports. 　Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan. 　As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland. 　Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries. 　Ports can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution. 　Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding. 　Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight>Flight</a> 

<font size=3>
Flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight). 　This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement. 　Many things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes. 　The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.

<font size=3>
Virginia, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains. 　Its geography and climate are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay. 　The state's capital is Richmond. 　Its most-populous city is Virginia Beach, and Fairfax County is the state's most-populous political subdivision. 　Virginia's population in 2022[update] was over 8.68 million, with 35% of the state's population in the Washington–Baltimore area. 　Virginia's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the Powhatan. 　In 1607, the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World. 　Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status. 　Slave labor and land acquired from displaced native tribes fueled the growing plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony. 　Virginia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolution, and several Revolutionary War battles were fought in in Virginia. 　During the American Civil War, Virginia was split when the state government in Richmond joined the Confederacy, but many of the state's northwestern counties remained loyal to the Union, separating as the state of West Virginia in 1863. 　Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following the Reconstruction era, both major political parties are competitive in modern Virginia. 　Virginia's state legislature is the Virginia General Assembly, which was established in July 1619, making it the oldest current law-making body in North America. 　It is made up of a 40-member Senate and a 100-member House of Delegates. 　Unlike other states, cities and counties in Virginia function as equals, and the state government manages most local roads inside them. 　It is also the only state where governors are prohibited from serving consecutive terms. 　Virginia's economy is diverse with a strong agriculture industry in the Shenandoah Valley; high tech and federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency; and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.

Joseph is a common male given name, derived from the Hebrew Yosef (יוֹסֵף). 　"Joseph" is used, along with "Josef", mostly in English, French and partially German languages. 　This spelling is also found as a variant in the languages of the modern-day Nordic countries. 　In Portuguese and Spanish, the name is "José". 　In Arabic, including in the Quran, the name is spelled يوسف Yūsuf. 　In Persian, the name is "Yousef". 　The name has enjoyed significant popularity in its many forms in numerous countries, and Joseph was one of the two names, along with Robert, to have remained in the top 10 boys' names list in the US from 1925 to 1972. 　It is especially common in contemporary Israel, as either "Yossi" or "Yossef", and in Italy, where the name "Giuseppe" was the most common male name in the 20th century. 　In the first century CE, Joseph was the second most popular male name for Palestine Jews. 　In the Book of Genesis Joseph is Jacob's eleventh son and Rachel's first son, and known in the Hebrew Bible as Yossef ben-Yaakov. 　In the New Testament the most notable two are Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus; and Joseph of Arimathea, a secret disciple of Jesus who supplied the tomb in which Jesus was buried.

<font size=3>
The neck is the part of the body on many vertebrates that connects the head with the torso. 　The neck supports the weight of the head and protects the nerves that carry sensory and motor information from the brain down to the rest of the body. 　In addition, the neck is highly flexible and allows the head to turn and flex in all directions. 　The structures of the human neck are anatomically grouped into four compartments; vertebral, visceral and two vascular compartments. 　Within these compartments, the neck houses the cervical vertebrae and cervical part of the spinal cord, upper parts of the respiratory and digestive tracts, endocrine glands, nerves, arteries and veins. 　Muscles of the neck are described separately from the compartments. 　They bound the neck triangles. 　In anatomy, the neck is also called by its Latin names, cervixcode: lat promoted to code: la or collumcode: lat promoted to code: la , although when used alone, in context, the word cervix more often refers to the uterine cervix, the neck of the uterus. 　Thus the adjective cervical may refer either to the neck (as in cervical vertebrae or cervical lymph nodes) or to the uterine cervix (as in cervical cap or cervical cancer).

<font size=3>
Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. 　Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra and interference. 　For most humans, color are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). 　Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelength, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus has a different color sensitivity range. 　Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain. 　Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation) and luminance. 　Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). 　If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. 　For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. 　As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors and television. 　The most well-known color models are RGB, CMYK, YUV, HSL and HSV. 　Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. 　Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. 　In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. 　The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple) and tertiary colors. 　The study of colors in general is called color science.

In physics, motion is the phenomenon in which an object changes its position with respect to time. 　Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed and frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with change in time. 　The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to its cause is called kinematics, while the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is called dynamics. 　If an object is not changing relative to a given frame of reference, the object is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have a constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings. 　Modern physics holds that, as there is no absolute frame of reference, Newton's concept of absolute motion cannot be determined. 　As such, everything in the universe can be considered to be in motion.　: 20–21  Motion applies to various physical systems: objects, bodies, matter particles, matter fields, radiation, radiation fields, radiation particles, curvature, and space-time. 　One can also speak on the motion of images, shapes, and boundaries. 　In general, the term motion signifies a continuous change in the positions or configuration of a physical system in space. 　For example, one can talk about the motion of a wave or the motion of a quantum particle, where the configuration consists of probabilities of the wave or particle occupying specific positions.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun>Gun</a> 

<font size=3>
A gun is a ranged weapon designed to use a shooting tube (gun barrel) to launch projectiles. 　The projectiles are typically solid, but can also be pressurized liquid (e.g. in water guns/cannons, spray guns for painting or pressure washing, projected water disruptors, and technically also flamethrowers), gas (e.g. light-gas gun) or even charged particles (e.g. plasma gun). 　Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon guns). 　A large-caliber gun is also called a cannon. 　The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within the barrel tube, produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns). 　The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle. 　Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns). 　The first devices identified as guns or proto-guns appeared in China from around AD 1000. 　By the end of the 13th century, they had become "true guns," metal barrel firearms that fired single projectiles which occluded the barrel. 　Gunpowder and gun technology spread throughout Eurasia during the 14th century.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>Algorithm</a> 

<font size=3>
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (listen)) is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. 　Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. 　More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning), achieving automation eventually. 　Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus". 　In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result. 　As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. 　Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. 　The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

<font size=3>
Male (symbol: ♂) is the sex of an organism that produces the gamete (sex cell) known as sperm, which fuses with the larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of fertilization. 　A male organism cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. 　Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs. 　Not all species share a common sex-determination system. 　In most animals, including humans, sex is determined genetically; however, species such as Cymothoa exigua change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity.　[better source needed] In humans, the word male can also be used to refer to gender in the social sense of gender role or gender identity.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear>Fear</a> 

<font size=3>
Fear is an intensely unpleasant emotion in response to perceiving or recognizing a danger or threat. 　Fear causes physiological changes that may produce behavioral reactions such as mounting an aggressive response or fleeing the threat. 　Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself. 　The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis. 　In humans and other animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. 　Thus, fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. 　An irrational fear is called a phobia. 　Fear is closely related to the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. 　The fear response serves survival by engendering appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution. 　Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals' fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.　[page needed] Fear is sometimes incorrectly considered the opposite of courage. 　For the reason that courage is a willingness to face adversity, fear is an example of a condition that makes the exercise of courage possible.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch>Watch</a> 

<font size=3>
A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. 　It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. 　A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. 　A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain. 　Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century. 　During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. 　These are called mechanical watches. 　In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. 　By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. 　Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland). 　Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist. 　They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities. 　In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. 　For mechanical watches, various extra features called "complications," such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included. 　Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions. 　Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time. 　Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. 　However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts. 　As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014. 　As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind>Wind</a> 

<font size=3>
Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface. 　Winds occur on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. 　The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). 　Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. 　In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can prevail. 　Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction, the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. 　Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content, or wind energy. 　In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. 　The convention for directions refer to where the wind comes from; therefore, a 'western' or 'westerly' wind blows from the west to the east, a 'northern' wind blows south, and so on. 　This is sometimes counter-intuitive. 　Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. 　Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. 　Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane. 　In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. 　The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. 　In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology, influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. 　Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. 　Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. 　Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. 　When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures can be damaged or destroyed. 　Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, for example loess, and by erosion. 　Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. 　Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. 　Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect and bird populations. 　When combined with cold temperatures, the wind has a negative impact on livestock. 　Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.

A box (plural: boxes) is a container used for the storage or transportation of its contents. 　Most boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides. 　Boxes can be very small (like a matchbox) or very large (like a shipping box for furniture), and can be used for a variety of purposes from functional to decorative. 　Boxes may be made of a variety of materials, both durable, such as wood and metal; and non-durable, such as corrugated fiberboard and paperboard. 　Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as shipping containers. 　Most commonly, boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides, making them rectangular prisms; but boxes may also have other shapes. 　Rectangular prisms are often referred to colloquially as "boxes." 　Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps, doors, or a separate lid. 　They can be secured shut with adhesives, tapes, or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms, such as a catch, clasp or lock.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ability>Ability</a> 

<font size=3>
Abilities are powers an agent has to perform various actions. 　They include common abilities, like walking, and rare abilities, like performing a double backflip. 　Abilities are intelligent powers: they are guided by the person's intention and executing them successfully results in an action, which is not true for all types of powers. 　They are closely related to but not identical with various other concepts, such as disposition, know-how, aptitude, talent, potential, and skill. 　Theories of ability aim to articulate the nature of abilities. 　Traditionally, the conditional analysis has been the most popular approach. 　According to it, having an ability means one would perform the action in question if one tried to do so. 　On this view, Michael Phelps has the ability to swim 200 meters in under 2 minutes because he would do so if he tried to. 　This approach has been criticized in various ways. 　Some counterexamples involve cases in which the agent is physically able to do something but unable to try, due to a strong aversion. 　In order to avoid these and other counterexamples, various alternative approaches have been suggested. 　Modal theories of ability, for example, focus on what is possible for the agent to do. 　Other suggestions include defining abilities in terms of dispositions and potentials. 　An important distinction among abilities is between general abilities and specific abilities. 　General abilities are abilities possessed by an agent independent of their situation while specific abilities concern what an agent can do in a specific situation. 　So while an expert piano player always has the general ability to play various piano pieces, they lack the corresponding specific ability in a situation where no piano is present. 　Another distinction concerns the question of whether successfully performing an action by accident counts as having the corresponding ability. 　In this sense, an amateur hacker may have the effective ability to hack his boss's email account, because they may be lucky and guess the password correctly, but not the corresponding transparent ability, since they are unable to reliably do so. 　The concept of abilities and how they are to be understood is relevant for various related fields. 　Free will, for example, is often understood as the ability to do otherwise. 　The debate between compatibilism and incompatibilism concerns the question whether this ability can exist in a world governed by deterministic laws of nature. 　Autonomy is a closely related concept, which can be defined as the ability of individual or collective agents to govern themselves. 　Whether an agent has the ability to perform a certain action is important for whether they have a moral obligation to perform this action. 　If they possess it, they may be morally responsible for performing it or for failing to do so. 　Like in the free will debate, it is also relevant whether they had the ability to do otherwise. 　A prominent theory of concepts and concept possession understands these terms in relation to abilities. 　According to it, it is required that the agent possess both the ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases and the ability to draw inferences to related concepts.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar>Guitar</a> 

<font size=3>
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 　It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. 　A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. 　The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier. 　The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. 　Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. 　Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s. 　The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. 　There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). 　Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". 　The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. 　The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. 　The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. 　Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing no resonant chamber. 　A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or "overdrive"). 　Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. 　As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music. 　The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. 　The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. 　The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. 　It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, ska, mariachi, metal, punk, funk, reggae, rock, grunge, soul, acoustic music, disco, new wave, new age, adult contemporary music, and pop, occasionally used as a sample in hip-hop, dubstep, or trap music.

Respect, also called esteem, is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important or held in high esteem or regard. 　It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities. 　It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings. 　Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. 　In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. 　Courtesies that show respect may include simple words and phrases like "Thank you" in the West or "Namaste" in the Indian subcontinent, or simple physical signs like a slight bow, a smile, direct eye contact, or a simple handshake; however, those acts may have very different interpretations, depending on the cultural context.
