## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball>Volleyball</a> 
<font size=3>
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. 　Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. 　It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. 　Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. 　The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball. 　The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. 　The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. 　The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. 　Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. 　An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. 　The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. 　A few of the most common faults include: causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net; catching and throwing the ball; double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team; net foul: touching the net during play; foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a front row player is trying to keep the ball in play. 　The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body. 　A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, specialized player positions, and offensive and defensive structures.

<font size=3>
Nevada (/nəˈvædə/ nə-VAD-ə; Spanish: [neˈβaða]) is a state in the Western region of the United States. 　It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. 　Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 32nd-most populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the U.S. states. 　Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area, including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities. 　Nevada's capital is Carson City. 　Las Vegas is the largest city in the state. 　Nevada is officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. 　It is also known as the "Battle Born State" because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words "Battle Born" also appear on its state flag); Due to a presidency held by Abraham Lincoln the Union benefited immensely from the support of newly awarded statehood by the infusion of the monetary support of nearly $400 million in silver ore generated at the time by the Comstock Lode.　[citation needed] Known also as the "Sagebrush State", for the native plant of the same name; and as the "Sage-hen State". 　The name means "snowy" in Spanish, referring to Nevada's small overlap with the Sierra Nevada mountain range; however, the rest of Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid, much of it within the Great Basin. 　Areas south of the Great Basin are within the Mojave Desert, while Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge. 　About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the U.S. federal government, both civilian and military. 　American Indians of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabit what is now Nevada. 　The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. 　They called the region Nevada (snowy) because of the snow which covered the mountains in winter similar to the Sierra Nevada in Spain. 　The area formed part of Alta California's territory within the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which gained independence as Mexico in 1821. 　The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the Mexican–American War, and it was incorporated as part of Utah Territory in 1850. 　The discovery of silver at the Comstock Lode in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of Nevada Territory out of western Utah Territory in 1861. 　Nevada became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, as the second of two states added to the Union during the Civil War (the first being West Virginia). 　Nevada has a reputation for its libertarian laws. 　In 1940, with a population of just over 110,000 people, Nevada was by far the least-populated state, with less than half the population of the next least-populous state, Wyoming. 　However, legalized gambling and lenient marriage and divorce laws transformed Nevada into a major tourist destination in the 20th century. 　Nevada is the only U.S. state where prostitution is legal, though it is illegal in its most populated regions – Clark County (Las Vegas), Washoe County (Reno) and Carson City (which, as an independent city, is not within the boundaries of any county). 　The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. 　Nevada is the driest state, and over time, and influenced by climate change, droughts in Nevada have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Nevada's water security.

<font size=3>
A thesis (plural: theses), or dissertation (abbreviated diss.), is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings. 　In some contexts, the word thesis or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally applied to a doctorate. 　This is the typical arrangement in American English. 　In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, the reverse is true. 　The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations. 　The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration. 　The word dissertation can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. 　The term thesis is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.

<font size=3>
Munich (/ˈmjuːnɪk/ MEW-nik; German: München [ˈmʏnçn̩] (listen); Bavarian: Minga [ˈmɪŋ(ː)ɐ] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of the German state of Bavaria. 　With a population of 1,558,395 inhabitants as of 31 July 2020, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. 　The city's metropolitan region is home to 6 million people. 　Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a tributary of the Danube) north of the Bavarian Alps, Munich is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km2). 　Munich is the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna. 　The city was first mentioned in 1158. 　Catholic Munich strongly resisted the Reformation and was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. 　Once Bavaria was established as a sovereign kingdom in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. 　In 1918, during the German Revolution, the ruling house of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived socialist republic was declared. 　In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the NSDAP. 　After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their "Capital of the Movement". 　The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but has restored most of its traditional cityscape. 　After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of Wirtschaftswunder, or "economic miracle". 　The city hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics and was one of the host cities of the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. 　Today, Munich is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. 　Munich is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of real estate prices and rental costs. 　According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Munich is considered an alpha-world city, as of 2015[update]. 　It is one of the most prosperous and fastest growing cities in Germany. 　The city is home to more than 530,000 people of foreign background, making up 37.7% of its population. 　Munich's economy is based on high tech, automobiles, the service sector and creative industries, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering and electronics among many other sectors. 　It has one of the strongest economies of any German city and the lowest unemployment rate of all cities in Germany with more than 1 million inhabitants. 　Munich is also one of the most attractive business locations in Germany. 　The city houses many multinational companies, such as BMW, Siemens, MAN, Allianz and MunichRE. 　In addition, Munich is home to two research universities, a multitude of scientific institutions, and world-renowned technology and science museums like the Deutsches Museum and BMW Museum. 　Munich's numerous architectural and cultural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest Volksfest, attract considerable tourism.

<font size=3>
A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. 　The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. 　A farmer might own the farm land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others. 　In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers (or farmhands). 　However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention. 　Over half a billion farmers are smallholders, most of whom are in developing countries, and who economically support almost two billion people. 　Globally, women constitute more than 40% of agricultural employees.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless>Wireless</a> 
<font size=3>
Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information (telecommunication) between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer. 　The most common wireless technologies use radio waves. 　With radio waves, intended distances can be short, such as a few meters for Bluetooth or as far as millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications. 　It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way radios, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. 　Other examples of applications of radio wireless technology include GPS units, garage door openers, wireless computer mouse, keyboards and headsets, headphones, radio receivers, satellite television, broadcast television and cordless telephones. 　Somewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications involve other electromagnetic phenomena, such as light and magnetic or electric fields, or the use of sound. 　The term wireless has been used twice in communications history, with slightly different meanings. 　It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology, as in wireless telegraphy, until the new word radio replaced it around 1920. 　Radio sets in the UK and the English-speaking world that were not portable continued to be referred to as wireless sets into the 1960s. 　The term wireless was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires, such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph, from those that require wires or cables. 　This became its primary usage in the 2000s, due to the advent of technologies such as mobile broadband, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. 　Wireless operations permit services, such as mobile and interplanetary communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. 　The term is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls, etc.) that use some form of energy (e.g. radio waves and acoustic energy) to transfer information without the use of wires. 　Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.

<font size=3>
A presidency is an administration or the executive, the collective administrative and governmental entity that exists around an office of president of a state or nation. 　Although often the executive branch of government, and often personified by a single elected person who holds the office of "president", in practice, the presidency includes a much larger collective of people, such as chiefs of staff, advisers and other bureaucrats. 　Although often led by a single person, presidencies can also be of a collective nature, such as the presidency of the European Union is held on a rotating basis by the various national governments of the member states. 　Alternatively, the term presidency can also be applied to the governing authority of some churches, and may even refer to the holder of a non-governmental office of president in a corporation, business, charity, university, etc. or the institutional arrangement around them. 　For example, "the presidency of the Red Cross refused to support his idea." 　Rules and support to discourage vicarious liability leading to unnecessary pressure and the early termination of term have not been clarified. 　These may not be as yet supported by state let initiatives. 　Contributory liability and fraud may be the two most common ways to become removed from term of office and/or to prevent re-election.

<font size=3>
In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. 　These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole, and probation. 　A typical correctional institution is a prison. 　A correctional system, also known as a penal system, thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons, and community-based programs like parole, and probation boards. 　This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. 　Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies. 　"Corrections" is also the name of a field of academic study concerned with the theories, policies, and programs pertaining to the practice of corrections. 　Its object of study includes personnel training and management as well as the experiences of those on the other side of the fence — the unwilling subjects of the correctional process. 　Stohr and colleagues (2008) write that "Earlier scholars were more honest, calling what we now call corrections by the name penology, which means the study of punishment for crime."

<font size=3>
Migration, in ecology, is the large-scale movement of members of a species to a different environment. 　Migration is a natural behavior and component of the life cycle of many species of mobile organisms, not limited to animals, though animal migration is the best known type. 　Migration is often cyclical, frequently occurring on a seasonal basis, and in some cases on a daily basis. 　Species migrate to take advantage of more favorable conditions with respect to food availability, safety from predation, mating opportunity, or other environmental factors. 　Migration is most commonly seen as animal migration, the physical movement by animals from one area to another. 　That includes bird, fish, and insect migration. 　However, plants can be said to migrate, as seed dispersal enables plants to grow in new areas, under environmental constraints such as temperature and rainfall, resulting in changes such as forest migration.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter>Helicopter</a> 
<font size=3>
A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors. 　This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. 　These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of STOL (Short TakeOff and Landing) or STOVL (Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing) aircraft cannot perform without a runway. 　In 1942, the Sikorsky R-4 became the first helicopter to reach full-scale production. 　Although most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, the configuration of a single main rotor accompanied by a vertical anti-torque tail rotor (i.e. unicopter, not to be confused with the single-blade monocopter) has become the most common helicopter configuration. 　However, twin-main rotor helicopters (bicopters), in either tandem or transverse rotors configurations, are sometimes in use due to their greater payload capacity than the monorotor design, and coaxial-rotor, tiltrotor and compound helicopters are also all flying today. 　Quadrotor helicopters (quadcopters) were pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and along with other types of multicopters, have been developed mainly for specialized applications such as drones.

<font size=3>
Coaching is a form of development in which an experienced person, called a coach, supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance. 　The learner is sometimes called a coachee. 　Occasionally, coaching may mean an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the latter learns; but coaching differs from mentoring by focusing on specific tasks or objectives, as opposed to more general goals or overall development.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink>Sink</a> 
<font size=3>
A sink is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes. 　Sinks have a tap (faucet) that supply hot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster rinsing. 　They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device. 　Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser. 　Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter. 　When a sink becomes clogged, a person will often resort to using a chemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the clog with a drain auger (often called a "plumber's snake").

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation>Calculation</a> 
<font size=3>
A calculation is a deliberate mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or results. 　The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people. 　For example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. 　Extracting the square root or the cube root of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation. 　Statistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers. 　To calculate means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using logic, reason or common sense. 　The English word derives from the Latin calculus, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin calx). 　It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin abacus, Greek abax). 　The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the slide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars. 　Calculation is a prerequisite for computation.　[citation needed]

<font size=3>
A fist is the shape of a hand when the fingers are bent inward against the palm and held there tightly. 　To make or clench a fist is to fold the fingers tightly into the center of the palm and then to clamp the thumb over the middle phalanges; in contrast to this "closed" fist, one keeps the fist "open" by holding the thumb against the side of the index finger. 　One uses the closed fist to punch the lower phalanges against a surface, or to pound with the little-finger side of the hand's heel; one uses the open fist to knock with the middle knuckle of the middle finger.

## <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime>Anime</a> 
<font size=3>
Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 　Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. 　However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 　Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation. 　The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 　A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. 　Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. 　In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. 　It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. 　Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 　It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. 　Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. 　Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes. 　The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G and Toei Animation. 　Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. 　As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.

<font size=3>
Venice Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/ VEH-niss; Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] (listen); Venetian: Venesia or Venexia[citation needed] [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. 　It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. 　The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). 　In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). 　Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million. 　The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. 　The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. 　It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. 　The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. 　This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. 　For centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. 　The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. 　Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy. 　Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of Masks", "City of Bridges", "The Floating City", and "City of Canals". 　The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 　Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. 　Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi. 　Although the city is facing some challenges (including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings), Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. 　It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as "undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man".
