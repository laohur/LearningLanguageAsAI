to | tu: | prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,<br> motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,<br> access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;<br> -- opposed to from.<br>prep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a<br> time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being<br> regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going<br> to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.<br>prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of<br> application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or<br> indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs<br> with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon<br> that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;<br> as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this<br> seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to<br> the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous<br> liquor.<br>prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last<br> defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it<br> as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to<br> go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my<br> utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost<br> constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no<br> prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or<br> subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's<br> country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the<br> infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed<br> the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.<br> xi. 8).<br>prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to<br> has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.<br>prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;<br> as, they met us to the number of three hundred.<br>prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to<br> his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to<br> the prejudice of the state.<br>prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they<br> engaged hand to hand.<br>prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has<br> a husband to her mind.<br>prep. Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven;<br> it is ten to one that you will offend him.<br>prep. Addition; union; accumulation.<br>prep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to<br> the music of a piano.<br>prep. Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office<br> filled. | prep. 到, 向, 趋于<br>adv. 向前 |  |  | 0.6

## Association (ecology)
In phytosociology and community ecology  an association is a type of ecological community with a predictable species composition and consistent physiognomy (structural appearance) which occurs in a particular habitat type.edition=Third The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt16 and formalised by the International Botanical Congress in 1910.182An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum.

## DONE
The Data-based Online Nonlinear Extremumseeker (DONE) algorithm is a black-box optimization algorithm.DONE models the unknown cost function and attempts to find an optimum of the underlying function.The DONE algorithm is suitable for optimizing costly and noisy functions and does not require derivatives.An advantage of DONE over similar algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, is that the computational cost per iteration is independent of the number of function evaluations.

## Word
The practice of separating words with spaces was not universal when this manuscript was written.A word is a basic element of language that carries an objective or practical meaning, can be used on its own, and is uninterruptible.page=473 Despite the fact that language speakers often have an intuitive grasp of what a word is, there is no consensus among linguists on its definition and numerous attempts to find specific criteria of the concept remain controversial.page=1285 Different standards have been proposed, depending on the theoretical background and descriptive context; these do not converge on a single definition.oclc=1097103078 Some specific definitions of the term "word" are employed to convey its different meanings at different levels of description, for example based on phonological, grammatical or orthographic basis.

## Cover (topology)
In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover  (or covering) of a set X is a collection of subsets of X whose union is all of X. More formally, if C = \lbrace U_\alpha : \alpha \in A \rbrace is an indexed family of subsets U_\alpha\subset X, then C is a cover of X if\bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha} = X. Thus the collection \lbrace U_\alpha : \alpha \in A \rbrace is a cover of X if each element of X belongs to at least one of the subsets U_{\alpha}.

## Attention
William James (1890) wrote that "Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence."pages=403–404 Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources.pages=519 Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck,location=United Kingdom leading to inattentional blindness.Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology.

## Illinois
Illinois (ɔɪ ') is a state in the Midwestern United States. Its largest metropolitan areas include the Chicago metropolitan area, and the Metro East section, of Greater St. Louis. Other metropolitan areas include, Peoria and Rockford, as well Springfield, its capital. Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth-largest population, and the 25th-largest land area.Illinois has a highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast, major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. Owing to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. Additionally, the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash rivers form parts of the state's boundaries. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has been among the world's ten busiest airports for decades. Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase Will it play in Peoria?.archive-date=January 14, 2009What is now Illinois was inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous cultures, including the advanced civilization centered in the Cahokia region. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi River in the 17th century, in the region they called Illinois Country, as part of the sprawling colony of New France. Following U.S. independence in 1783, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. Illinois was part of the United States' oldest territory, the Northwest Territory, and in 1818 it achieved statehood.

Cancer (from Latin; sometimes known by the transliteration Carcinos, from the original Greek Καρκίνος: Karkinos) or, simply the Crab, is a giant crab in Greek mythology that inhabited the lagoon of Lerna.language=es He is a secondary character in the myth of the twelve labors of Heracles, who attacks Heracles  on Hera's orders, while Heracles is in the midst of fighting the Hydra of Lerna.website=www.perseus.tufts.edu Heracles kills the Crab, who is rewarded for his efforts by Hera turning him into the constellation of Cancer.language=enSince it is not a main element of the myth, it does not always appear in the versions that have reached the present day; nevertheless, classic mythographers, astronomers, historians or philosophers such as Plato, the Pseudo-Eratosthenes, the Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus mention the character in their texts.One of the most common interpretations of the myth associates it with a 22nd century B.C. battle in the Peloponnese, which resulted in the destruction of Lerna (Minoan-influenced) by pre-Mycenaean peopleslanguage=enIn art, Carcinos is often depicted as a detail of the myth of the Hydra or as an image of the Zodiac sign and the constellation to which it gives its name.

## Emergency
An emergency is an urgent, unexpected, and usually dangerous situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment and requires immediate action.archive-date=2007-06-06   Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

## Snow
Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes.It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air.

## Mechanism (sociology)
The term social mechanisms and mechanism-based explanations of social phenomena originate from the philosophy of science.The core thinking behind the mechanism approach has been expressed as follows by Elster (1989: 3-4): “To explain an event is to give an account of why it happened. Usually… this takes the form of citing an earlier event as the cause of the event we want to explain…. But to cite the cause is not enough: the causal mechanism must also be provided, or at least suggested.”Existing definitions differ a great deal from one another, but underlying them all is an emphasis on making intelligible the regularities being observed by specifying in detail how they were brought about.

## Gender
Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to femininity and masculinity and differentiating between them.date=October 2022 Depending on the context, this may include sex-based social structures (i.e. gender roles) and gender identity.doi-access=freeurl-status=dead  Most cultures use a gender binary, in which gender is divided into two categories, and people are considered part of one or the other (boys/men and girls/women);url-status=live Kevin L. Nadal, The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender (2017, 1483384276), page 401: "Most cultures currently construct their societies based on the understanding of gender binary—the two gender categorizations (male and female). Such societies divide their population based on biological sex assigned to individuals at birth to begin the process of gender socialization." those who are outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary.

## Democracy
Democracy (From dēmokratía, dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule'agency=Oxford University Press) is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation ("direct democracy"), or to choose governing officials to do so ("representative democracy"). Who is considered part of "the people" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, property rights, freedom of religion and speech, inclusiveness and equality, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy.s2cid=216190330Prevalent day-to-day decision making of democracies is the majority rule,access-date=5 July 2018Locke, John. Two Treatises on Government: a Translation into Modern English. Quote: "There is no practical alternative to majority political rule – i.e., to taking the consent of the majority as the act of the whole and binding every individual. It would be next to impossible to obtain the consent of every individual before acting collectively ... No rational people could desire and constitute a society that had to dissolve straightaway because the majority was unable to make the final decision and the society was incapable of acting as one body."There is no practical alternative to majority political rule %E2%80%93 i.e., to taking the consent of the majority as the act of the whole and binding every individual."

## Gospel
Gospel originally meant the Christian message ("the gospel"), but in the 2nd century it came to be used also for the books in which the message was set out.p=697 In this sense a gospel can be defined as a loose-knit, episodic narrative of the words and deeds of Jesus, culminating in his trial and death and concluding with various reports of his post-resurrection appearances.p=16 Modern scholars are cautious of relying on the gospels uncritically, but nevertheless, they provide a good idea of the public career of Jesus, and critical study can attempt to distinguish the original ideas of Jesus from those of the later authors.pp=21–22The four canonical gospels were probably written between AD 66 and 110.p=241p=18 All four were anonymous (with the modern names added in the 2nd century), almost certainly none were by eyewitnesses, and all are the end-products of long oral and written transmission.pp=13, 42 Mark was the first to be written, using a variety of sources.p=56 The authors of Matthew and Luke both independently used Mark for their narrative of Jesus's career, supplementing it with a collection of sayings called the Q source and additional material unique to each.p=6 There is near-consensus that John had its origins as the hypothetical Signs Gospel thought to have been circulated within a Johannine community.p=309 The contradictions and discrepancies between the first three and John make it impossible to accept both traditions as equally reliable.p=523Many non-canonical gospels were also written, all later than the four canonical gospels, and like them advocating the particular theological views of their various authors.p=51 Important examples include the gospels of Thomas, Peter, Judas, and Mary; infancy gospels such as that of James (the first to introduce the perpetual virginity of Mary); and gospel harmonies such as the Diatessaron.

## Closure (topology)
In topology, the closure of a subset S of points in a topological space consists of all points in S together with all limit points of S. The closure of S may equivalently be defined as the union of S and its boundary, and also as the intersection of all closed sets containing S. Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in S or "near" S. A point which is in the closure of S is a point of closure of S. The notion of closure is in many ways dual to the notion of interior.

## Gentleman
As such, the connotation of the term gentleman captures the common denominator of gentility (and often a coat of arms); a right shared by the peerage and the gentry, the constituent classes of the British nobility.Therefore, the English social category of gentleman corresponds to the French gentilhomme (nobleman), which in Great Britain meant a member of the peerage of England.p=604 In that context, the historian Maurice Keen said that the social category of gentleman is "the nearest, contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France."p=9 In the 14th century, the term gentlemen comprised the hereditary ruling class, which is whom the rebels of the Peasants' Revolt (1381) meant when they repeated:In the 17th century, in Titles of Honour (1614), the jurist John Selden said that the title gentleman likewise speaks of "our English use of it" as convertible with nobilis (nobility by rank or personal quality) p= and describes the forms of a man's elevation to the nobility in European monarchies.p=604 In the 19th century, James Henry Lawrence explained and discussed the concepts, particulars, and functions of social rank in a monarchy, in the book On the Nobility of the British Gentry, or the Political Ranks and Dignities of the British Empire, Compared with those on the Continent (1827).
