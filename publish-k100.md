to | tu: | prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,<br> motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,<br> access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;<br> -- opposed to from.<br>prep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a<br> time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being<br> regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going<br> to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.<br>prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of<br> application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or<br> indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs<br> with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon<br> that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;<br> as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this<br> seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to<br> the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous<br> liquor.<br>prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last<br> defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it<br> as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to<br> go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my<br> utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost<br> constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no<br> prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or<br> subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's<br> country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the<br> infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed<br> the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.<br> xi. 8).<br>prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to<br> has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.<br>prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;<br> as, they met us to the number of three hundred.<br>prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to<br> his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to<br> the prejudice of the state.<br>prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they<br> engaged hand to hand.<br>prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has<br> a husband to her mind.<br>prep. Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven;<br> it is ten to one that you will offend him.<br>prep. Addition; union; accumulation.<br>prep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to<br> the music of a piano.<br>prep. Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office<br> filled. | prep. 到, 向, 趋于<br>adv. 向前 |  |  | 0.6
