to | tu: | prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,<br> motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,<br> access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;<br> -- opposed to from.<br>prep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a<br> time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being<br> regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going<br> to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.<br>prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of<br> application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or<br> indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs<br> with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon<br> that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;<br> as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this<br> seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to<br> the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous<br> liquor.<br>prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last<br> defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it<br> as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to<br> go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my<br> utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost<br> constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no<br> prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or<br> subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's<br> country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the<br> infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed<br> the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.<br> xi. 8).<br>prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to<br> has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.<br>prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;<br> as, they met us to the number of three hundred.<br>prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to<br> his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to<br> the prejudice of the state.<br>prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they<br> engaged hand to hand.<br>prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has<br> a husband to her mind.<br>prep. Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven;<br> it is ten to one that you will offend him.<br>prep. Addition; union; accumulation.<br>prep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to<br> the music of a piano.<br>prep. Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office<br> filled. | prep. 到, 向, 趋于<br>adv. 向前 |  |  | 0.6

## Association (ecology) 
In phytosociology and community ecology  an association is a type of ecological community with a predictable species composition and consistent physiognomy (structural appearance) which occurs in a particular habitat type.edition=Third The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt16 and formalised by the International Botanical Congress in 1910.182An association can be viewed as a real, integrated entity shaped either by species interactions or by similar habitat requirements, or it can be viewed as merely a common point along a continuum.

## Attention 
William James (1890) wrote that "Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence."pages=403–404 Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources.pages=519 Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck,location=United Kingdom leading to inattentional blindness.Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology.
